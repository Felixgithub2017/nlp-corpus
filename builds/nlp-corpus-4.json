["Hey!\nYeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?\nSure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!\nOK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?\nNo!\nOK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.\nOur balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said\"No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there.\" And I said \"Maybe if we put some light out there they will\"\nRight that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !\nSo are you gonna...talk to her?\nWhy...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!\nYou know when \"That's fine\" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!\nNo I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!\nNo no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?\nI don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman \"accidentally\" sat on my hand.\nDude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!\nWell, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.\nWhy did I get married?!\nHey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?\nWell it depends.\nOn...?\nOn how far along he's in the sex change process!\nNo I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows are...\nOk! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!\nYour knuckles are kinda hairy too...\nOh man! I have to get those done too?!\nWow! Talking about high maintenance\nHey hey! You dye your hair!\nI'm a woman!\nArghhh! Double standards!\nOh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?\nOnly if I don't have to get up and sing.\nBut everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone booed him off the stage. So funny.\nIt's just, I'm not good at singing.\nOh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?\nNo no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!\nOK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.\nSo I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?\nWhile drinking...\nI'm there!\nHi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.\nWell yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there\nNo not that. I kissed Gavin last night.\nOh my god.\nYou kissed him?\nYeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...\nWait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?\nIt was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.\nOh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?\nYou know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...\nI thought you hated him?\nYou know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!\nSo are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?\nI don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don'tknow what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.\nSounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross\nOr...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...\nWow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!\nHi\nHey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.\nName?\nChandler Bing.\nOk. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.\nOK Thanks.. I touched the stuff\nI'll take care of it\nThanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?\nOh absolutely.\nOh good...\nAre you looking to meet somebody?\nAll right let's just do this.\nWe'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...\nPlease I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!Just a little bit of shock that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!\nHey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?\nNot well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.\nWell maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....\nThat's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?\nWhat are doing? You know I can only dish it out!\nI can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me\nMaybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing\nNo no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.\nDid she go out with him?\nNo. When he called, I...I threw the message away.\nAh! The high road...\nYou know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!\nAre you trying to get everybody divorced?\nYou don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one...\nI thought I had to make the jokes!\nDon't you have to be at work?\nOh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!\nHum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Hereï¿½s a question: \"Would you...would you rather drown or be burnt alive?\"\nSorry...we were just leaving\nWe still got it!\nWho is it?\nGavin! I brought you some soup.\nWhy?\nI heard you were sick...\nOh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin\nI missed you at work today. How are you feeling?\nI a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick\nOh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me.\nOh no no no\nSo I had fun last night\nSo did I\nExactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?\nIt's just a cold\nDo you have fever? Let me see. Hum...\nWhat? What's the matter?\nWhat's Ross doing to you on that picture?\nOh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.\nRight. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything\nOh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!\nYeah! But you said not to worry about...\nI lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!\nHi!\nOh! Molly! You're not Ross.\nNo I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?\nRight, right, yes!\nDon't panic!\nWhat?\nThere is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse.\nNo! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.Gavin come out from behind that curtain!\nHi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there.\nHello! I just go and get Emma.\nOK.\nSo hum...Why did I have to hide?\nI thought it was Ross.\nSo what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two...\nThere isn't. There is totally isn't.\nYou hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be arodeo clown.\nAll right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not inany relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm just all over the place.\nIt's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a piece of advice?\nYes\nI think you should talk to Ross about all this.\nPeople keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin\nDon't be. It's just bad timing.\nSo seriously...rodeo clown?\nOne of the best, ma'am, one of the best...\n\"No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!\" Thank you!\nOh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to get a break and when we come back we've got Kennethsinging \"I touch myself\"...I'm not here to judge!\nHi hi...Oh you have got to sing.\nNo I told you I can't.\nBut you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.\nWhat have you heard me sing?\nAll the time when you're cooking.\nWhat?\nYeah you're always singing \"Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy\"\nYeah I do rock that one.\nOK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?\nJust a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...\nWell I've got a book around...\n\"Delta Dawn\"\nHi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace\nYou already hit on me an hour ago\nRight, so that's a firm \"no\". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.\nI don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed\nThis is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.\nBy drowning or...?!\nWhy would he break up with me?\nHer friend: I don't know sweetie.\nAll I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. I mean, am I so unlovable?\nWell...\nI know!\nAll right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of \"I touch myself\". Coming up next we've got Monicasinging \"Delta Dawn\".\nWait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.\nJust pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.\nHi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing \"Delta Dawn\"\"Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ...\"\nCan you totally see through her shirt ?\nLike an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.\n\"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?\"\nHey, I need your help.\nWow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?\nLook, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped\nI am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!\nYou may be a sissy but I'll still . All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they donï¿½t match!\nItï¿½s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!\nAll right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI donï¿½t look stupid for my pictures.\nOk. First of all, this is green!\nWhat the hell am I supposed to do!\nAll right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.\nWhat, what.\nOk, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his ï¿½businessï¿½ partners.\nOh my God!\nYeah, well, I guess you donï¿½t need my help Victor Victoria!\nOk all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I donï¿½t know if I can take anymoreplucking. It hurts so bad!\nOh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.\n\"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y\". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?\nEvery little bit of you!\nI canï¿½t believe I did this. I canï¿½t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear thatone shouting ï¿½look at those tipsï¿½! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?\nSure.\nMon', not that you didnï¿½t sound good, but...\nGood? Didnï¿½t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. Thatï¿½s is the best gift ever.\nAlso a good gift? Underwear.\nThank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone doanything else.\nBut, whatï¿½s great is that you donï¿½t mind talking about it.\nItï¿½s so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with me, because itï¿½s like you lose a boyfriend,you get a boyfriend.\nUh-ah!\nNo donï¿½t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.\n. Good choice Ross.\nOh, hey! Hi, there you are, Iï¿½ve been looking for you everywhere!\nOh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.\nListen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine oï¿½ clock. So I was hoping you and I could have achance to kind of talkï¿½ somebody here?\nOh, yeah, yeah thatï¿½s Michelle.\nWho?\nOh, just this woman Iï¿½ve been seeing.\nYouï¿½ve being seeing someone?\nYeah, didnï¿½t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we havenï¿½t being going out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. I-I mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.\nWhat are you taking amoxicillin for?\nHow great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, thatï¿½smy roommate, Rachel.\nHi, and I am also Emmaï¿½s mother.\nAh, who is Emma?\nI told you about my daughter.\nThis is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!\nAnd done!\nOh my God! I didnï¿½t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the saloon\nThanks. You wanna see what it looks like?\nYeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!\nYeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.\nThank you so much.\nNo problem.\nListen thatï¿½s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.\nYeah.\nComb my eyelashes.\nOk, for my next song I think Iï¿½ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters ï¿½I am so excitedï¿½. And make it bouncy!\nOh youï¿½ll probably take care of that on your hands.\nI am sorry I am late. Youï¿½ll understand when youï¿½ll see Joey.\nHoney, youï¿½re just in time, Iï¿½m about to sing another song!\nReally? In front of all this people?\nAnd they love me!\nOh my God!\nYes, she gives the people what they want.\nAll right, watch!\n\"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some affection...\"\nAre those my wifeï¿½s nipples?\nOh? Isnï¿½t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.\nI gotta stop this.\nOh, who cares, they still love me! \"I am so excited...\"\nYou, touching yourself, out!\nWow. She does that a lot!\nRoss, you didnï¿½t tell me you were a doctor!\nWhat, what, wait a minute! You havenï¿½t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, likean hour?\nActually about an hour and a half.\nI told you it wasnï¿½t long, but there is an amazing connection between us.\nYou feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!\nAre you kidding?\nHey, do you want to go away this weekend?\nWeï¿½ll see.\nOk, Ross, whatï¿½s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?\nI donï¿½t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?\nHow do you know about that?\nThrough the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...\nEmma.\nWhen I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?\nOh, thatï¿½s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?\nNo, actually, see I had to pee, ï¿½cause I canï¿½t use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites.\nOk, Michelle, itï¿½s time to go.\nWell, call me!\nOk.\nNo, wait, you donï¿½t have my phone number!\nYou know, if itï¿½s meant to be, Iï¿½ll guess it. Bye, bye.\nScore.\nOh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.\nOh God, I canï¿½t believe youï¿½re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!\nOh, really!\nYeah.\nOh, really!\nOh yeah.\nWhat about the guy from the bar?\nWhat? Who?\nThe guy you gave your number to.\nWhoa, how do you know about that?\nBecause he called here looking for you. So donï¿½t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? Youï¿½ve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didnï¿½t even have the courtesy to tell me.\nWhy didnï¿½t I get that message?\nWhat?\nFrom the guy in the bar, why didnï¿½t I get that message?\nBecause I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?\nRoss?\nI never gave it to you.\nWhy?\nI donï¿½t know.\nOh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?\nWho am I?\nYes.\nI am the guy whoï¿½s taking care of our baby while youï¿½re out at bars meeting guys!\nOh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with youAbout us! But I canï¿½t do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment!\nNone of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! Thatï¿½s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the oneWho moved on and didnï¿½t tell anyone!\nOh, Ross, this is just so messed up! Whatï¿½s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation theyAlways ask, ï¿½what, you live together but youï¿½re not a couple? And you have a baby, isnï¿½t that weird?ï¿½ And I say ï¿½No.You know what, itï¿½s not, because it works for us!ï¿½ But you know this doesnï¿½t work. In fact this is the opposite of working!\nUh, clearly.\nAnd you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,Just doesnï¿½t make sense anymore.\nYeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?\nHey!\nHi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?\nHa, oh, of course.\nThank you.\nYour eyebrows look weird.\nï¿½Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine.ï¿½ So you just touch yourself for anything?\n","THE Kingâs son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.\nHe had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.\nShe was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a\nsledge drawn by six reindeer.  The sledge was shaped like a great golden\nswan, and between the swanâs wings lay the little Princess herself.  Her\nlong ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny\ncap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she\nhad always lived.  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets\nall the people wondered.  âShe is like a white rose!â they cried, and\nthey threw down flowers on her from the balconies.\n\nAt the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had\ndreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he\nsank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.\n\nâYour picture was beautiful,â he murmured, âbut you are more beautiful\nthan your pictureâ; and the little Princess blushed.\n\nâShe was like a white rose before,â said a young Page to his neighbour,\nâbut she is like a red rose nowâ; and the whole Court was delighted.\n\nFor the next three days everybody went about saying, âWhite rose, Red\nrose, Red rose, White roseâ; and the King gave orders that the Pageâs\nsalary was to be doubled.  As he received no salary at all this was not\nof much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly\npublished in the Court Gazette.\n\nWhen the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  It was a\nmagnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand\nunder a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.  Then\nthere was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and\nPrincess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear\ncrystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips\ntouched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.\n\nâItâs quite clear that they love each other,â said the little Page, âas\nclear as crystal!â and the King doubled his salary a second time.  âWhat\nan honour!â cried all the courtiers.\n\nAfter the banquet there was to be a Ball.  The bride and bridegroom were\nto dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the\nflute.  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so,\nbecause he was the King.  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never\nquite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for,\nwhatever he did, everybody cried out, âCharming! charming!â\n\nThe last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be\nlet off exactly at midnight.  The little Princess had never seen a\nfirework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal\nPyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.\n\nâWhat are fireworks like?â she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she\nwas walking on the terrace.\n\nâThey are like the Aurora Borealis,â said the King, who always answered\nquestions that were addressed to other people, âonly much more natural.\nI prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to\nappear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.  You must\ncertainly see them.â\n\nSo at the end of the Kingâs garden a great stand had been set up, and as\nsoon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place,\nthe fireworks began to talk to each other.\n\nâThe world is certainly very beautiful,â cried a little Squib.  âJust\nlook at those yellow tulips.  Why! if they were real crackers they could\nnot be lovelier.  I am very glad I have travelled.  Travel improves the\nmind wonderfully, and does away with all oneâs prejudices.â\n\nâThe Kingâs garden is not the world, you foolish squib,â said a big Roman\nCandle; âthe world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days\nto see it thoroughly.â\n\nâAny place you love is the world to you,â exclaimed a pensive Catherine\nWheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided\nherself on her broken heart; âbut love is not fashionable any more, the\npoets have killed it.  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed\nthem, and I am not surprised.  True love suffers, and is silent.  I\nremember myself onceâBut it is no matter now.  Romance is a thing of the\npast.â\n\nâNonsense!â said the Roman Candle, âRomance never dies.  It is like the\nmoon, and lives for ever.  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love\neach other very dearly.  I heard all about them this morning from a\nbrown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as\nmyself, and knew the latest Court news.â\n\nBut the Catherine Wheel shook her head.  âRomance is dead, Romance is\ndead, Romance is dead,â she murmured.  She was one of those people who\nthink that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times,\nit becomes true in the end.\n\nSuddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.\n\nIt came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end\nof a long stick.  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as\nto attract attention.\n\nâAhem! ahem!â he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine\nWheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, âRomance is dead.â\n\nâOrder! order!â cried out a Cracker.  He was something of a politician,\nand had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew\nthe proper Parliamentary expressions to use.\n\nâQuite dead,â whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.\n\nAs soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and\nbegan.  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating\nhis memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he\nwas talking.  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.\n\nâHow fortunate it is for the Kingâs son,â he remarked, âthat he is to be\nmarried on the very day on which I am to be let off.  Really, if it had\nbeen arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him;\nbut, Princes are always lucky.â\n\nâDear me!â said the little Squib, âI thought it was quite the other way,\nand that we were to be let off in the Princeâs honour.â\n\nâIt may be so with you,â he answered; âindeed, I have no doubt that it\nis, but with me it is different.  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come\nof remarkable parents.  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel\nof her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.  When she made her\ngreat public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went\nout, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink\nstars.  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very\nbest gunpowder.  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French\nextraction.  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would\nnever come down again.  He did, though, for he was of a kindly\ndisposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden\nrain.  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering\nterms.  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic\nart.â\n\nâPyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,â said a Bengal Light; âI know it is\nPyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.â\n\nâWell, I said Pylotechnic,â answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of\nvoice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to\nbully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of\nsome importance.\n\nâI was saying,â continued the Rocket, âI was sayingâWhat was I saying?â\n\nâYou were talking about yourself,â replied the Roman Candle.\n\nâOf course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was\nso rudely interrupted.  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind,\nfor I am extremely sensitive.  No one in the whole world is so sensitive\nas I am, I am quite sure of that.â\n\nâWhat is a sensitive person?â said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.\n\nâA person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other\npeopleâs toes,â answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the\nCracker nearly exploded with laughter.\n\nâPray, what are you laughing at?â inquired the Rocket; âI am not\nlaughing.â\n\nâI am laughing because I am happy,â replied the Cracker.\n\nâThat is a very selfish reason,â said the Rocket angrily.  âWhat right\nhave you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others.  In fact, you\nshould be thinking about me.  I am always thinking about myself, and I\nexpect everybody else to do the same.  That is what is called sympathy.\nIt is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.  Suppose,\nfor instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that\nwould be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy\nagain, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I\nknow he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the\nimportance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.â\n\nâIf you want to give pleasure to others,â cried the Roman Candle, âyou\nhad better keep yourself dry.â\n\nâCertainly,â exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits;\nâthat is only common sense.â\n\nâCommon sense, indeed!â said the Rocket indignantly; âyou forget that I\nam very uncommon, and very remarkable.  Why, anybody can have common\nsense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination,\nfor I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as\nbeing quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no\none here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for\nmyself, I donât care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is\nthe consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this\nis a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any\nhearts.  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and\nPrincess had not just been married.â\n\nâWell, really,â exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, âwhy not?  It is a most\njoyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the\nstars all about it.  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about\nthe pretty bride.â\n\nâAh! what a trivial view of life!â said the Rocket; âbut it is only what\nI expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why,\nperhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there\nis a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little\nfair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps\nsome day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may\ngo to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall\ninto the deep river and be drowned.  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor\npeople, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall\nnever get over it.â\n\nâBut they have not lost their only son,â said the Roman Candle; âno\nmisfortune has happened to them at all.â\n\nâI never said that they had,â replied the Rocket; âI said that they\nmight.  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying\nanything more about the matter.  I hate people who cry over spilt milk.\nBut when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very\nmuch affected.â\n\nâYou certainly are!â cried the Bengal Light.  âIn fact, you are the most\naffected person I ever met.â\n\nâYou are the rudest person I ever met,â said the Rocket, âand you cannot\nunderstand my friendship for the Prince.â\n\nâWhy, you donât even know him,â growled the Roman Candle.\n\nâI never said I knew him,â answered the Rocket.  âI dare say that if I\nknew him I should not be his friend at all.  It is a very dangerous thing\nto know oneâs friends.â\n\nâYou had really better keep yourself dry,â said the Fire-balloon.  âThat\nis the important thing.â\n\nâVery important for you, I have no doubt,â answered the Rocket, âbut I\nshall weep if I chooseâ; and he actually burst into real tears, which\nflowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little\nbeetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were\nlooking for a nice dry spot to live in.\n\nâHe must have a truly romantic nature,â said the Catherine Wheel, âfor he\nweeps when there is nothing at all to weep aboutâ; and she heaved a deep\nsigh, and thought about the deal box.\n\nBut the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept\nsaying, âHumbug! humbug!â at the top of their voices.  They were\nextremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called\nit humbug.\n\nThen the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to\nshine, and a sound of music came from the palace.\n\nThe Prince and Princess were leading the dance.  They danced so\nbeautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and\nwatched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.\n\nThen ten oâclock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the\nlast stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King\nsent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.\n\nâLet the fireworks begin,â said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made\na low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.  He had six\nattendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a\nlong pole.\n\nIt was certainly a magnificent display.\n\nWhizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.\nBoom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the\nplace, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  âGood-bye,â\ncried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.\nBang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves\nimmensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.\nHe was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best\nthing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it\nwas of no use.  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak,\nexcept with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers\nwith blossoms of fire.  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little\nPrincess laughed with pleasure.\n\nâI suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,â said the\nRocket; âno doubt that is what it means,â and he looked more supercilious\nthan ever.\n\nThe next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.  âThis is evidently\na deputation,â said the Rocket; âI will receive them with becoming\ndignityâ so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if\nhe were thinking about some very important subject.  But they took no\nnotice of him at all till they were just going away.  Then one of them\ncaught sight of him.  âHallo!â he cried, âwhat a bad rocket!â and he\nthrew him over the wall into the ditch.\n\nâBAD Rocket?  BAD Rocket?â he said, as he whirled through the air;\nâimpossible!  GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.  BAD and GRAND\nsound very much the same, indeed they often are the sameâ; and he fell\ninto the mud.\n\nâIt is not comfortable here,â he remarked, âbut no doubt it is some\nfashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my\nhealth.  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require\nrest.â\n\nThen a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat,\nswam up to him.\n\nâA new arrival, I see!â said the Frog.  âWell, after all there is nothing\nlike mud.  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.  Do\nyou think it will be a wet afternoon?  I am sure I hope so, but the sky\nis quite blue and cloudless.  What a pity!â\n\nâAhem! ahem!â said the Rocket, and he began to cough.\n\nâWhat a delightful voice you have!â cried the Frog.  âReally it is quite\nlike a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the\nworld.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck\npond close by the farmerâs house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.\nIt is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact,\nit was only yesterday that I heard the farmerâs wife say to her mother\nthat she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is\nmost gratifying to find oneself so popular.â\n\nâAhem! ahem!â said the Rocket angrily.  He was very much annoyed that he\ncould not get a word in.\n\nâA delightful voice, certainly,â continued the Frog; âI hope you will\ncome over to the duck-pond.  I am off to look for my daughters.  I have\nsix beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He\nis a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off\nthem.  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I\nassure you.â\n\nâConversation, indeed!â said the Rocket.  âYou have talked the whole time\nyourself.  That is not conversation.â\n\nâSomebody must listen,â answered the Frog, âand I like to do all the\ntalking myself.  It saves time, and prevents arguments.â\n\nâBut I like arguments,â said the Rocket.\n\nâI hope not,â said the Frog complacently.  âArguments are extremely\nvulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.\nGood-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little\nFrog swam away.\n\nâYou are a very irritating person,â said the Rocket, âand very ill-bred.\nI hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to\ntalk about oneself, as I do.  It is what I call selfishness, and\nselfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my\ntemperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.  In fact, you\nshould take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.\nNow that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I\nam going back to Court almost immediately.  I am a great favourite at\nCourt; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my\nhonour.  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a\nprovincial.â\n\nâThere is no good talking to him,â said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on\nthe top of a large brown bulrush; âno good at all, for he has gone away.â\n\nâWell, that is his loss, not mine,â answered the Rocket.  âI am not going\nto stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.  I like\nhearing myself talk.  It is one of my greatest pleasures.  I often have\nlong conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I\ndonât understand a single word of what I am saying.â\n\nâThen you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,â said the Dragon-fly;\nand he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.\n\nâHow very silly of him not to stay here!â said the Rocket.  âI am sure\nthat he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.  However,\nI donât care a bit.  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some\ndayâ; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.\n\nAfter some time a large White Duck swam up to him.  She had yellow legs,\nand webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her\nwaddle.\n\nâQuack, quack, quack,â she said.  âWhat a curious shape you are!  May I\nask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?â\n\nâIt is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,â answered\nthe Rocket, âotherwise you would know who I am.  However, I excuse your\nignorance.  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable\nas oneself.  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up\ninto the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain.â\n\nâI donât think much of that,â said the Duck, âas I cannot see what use it\nis to any one.  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw\na cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that\nwould be something.â\n\nâMy good creature,â cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, âI\nsee that you belong to the lower orders.  A person of my position is\nnever useful.  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than\nsufficient.  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least\nof all with such industries as you seem to recommend.  Indeed, I have\nalways been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who\nhave nothing whatever to do.â\n\nâWell, well,â said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and\nnever quarrelled with any one, âeverybody has different tastes.  I hope,\nat any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here.â\n\nâOh! dear no,â cried the Rocket.  âI am merely a visitor, a distinguished\nvisitor.  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.  There is\nneither society here, nor solitude.  In fact, it is essentially suburban.\nI shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make\na sensation in the world.â\n\nâI had thoughts of entering public life once myself,â remarked the Duck;\nâthere are so many things that need reforming.  Indeed, I took the chair\nat a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning\neverything that we did not like.  However, they did not seem to have much\neffect.  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.â\n\nâI am made for public life,â said the Rocket, âand so are all my\nrelations, even the humblest of them.  Whenever we appear we excite great\nattention.  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will\nbe a magnificent sight.  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and\ndistracts oneâs mind from higher things.â\n\nâAh! the higher things of life, how fine they are!â said the Duck; âand\nthat reminds me how hungry I feelâ: and she swam away down the stream,\nsaying, âQuack, quack, quack.â\n\nâCome back! come back!â screamed the Rocket, âI have a great deal to say\nto youâ; but the Duck paid no attention to him.  âI am glad that she has\ngone,â he said to himself, âshe has a decidedly middle-class mindâ; and\nhe sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the\nloneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came\nrunning down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots.\n\nâThis must be the deputation,â said the Rocket, and he tried to look very\ndignified.\n\nâHallo!â cried one of the boys, âlook at this old stick!  I wonder how it\ncame hereâ; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.\n\nâOLD Stick!â said the Rocket, âimpossible!  GOLD Stick, that is what he\nsaid.  Gold Stick is very complimentary.  In fact, he mistakes me for one\nof the Court dignitaries!â\n\nâLet us put it into the fire!â said the other boy, âit will help to boil\nthe kettle.â\n\nSo they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit\nthe fire.\n\nâThis is magnificent,â cried the Rocket, âthey are going to let me off in\nbroad day-light, so that every one can see me.â\n\nâWe will go to sleep now,â they said, âand when we wake up the kettle\nwill be boiledâ; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.\n\nThe Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.  At last,\nhowever, the fire caught him.\n\nâNow I am going off!â he cried, and he made himself very stiff and\nstraight.  âI know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher\nthan the moon, much higher than the sun.  In fact, I shall go so high\nthatââ\n\nFizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.\n\nâDelightful!â he cried, âI shall go on like this for ever.  What a\nsuccess I am!â\n\nBut nobody saw him.\n\nThen he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.\n\nâNow I am going to explode,â he cried.  âI shall set the whole world on\nfire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for\na whole year.â  And he certainly did explode.  Bang! Bang! Bang! went the\ngunpowder.  There was no doubt about it.\n\nBut nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound\nasleep.\n\nThen all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the\nback of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.\n\nâGood heavens!â cried the Goose.  âIt is going to rain sticksâ; and she\nrushed into the water.\n\nâI knew I should create a great sensation,â gasped the Rocket, and he\nwent out.\n\n","I had been researching LSD online for months during my senior year in High School because I had a strong desire to take LSD and experience all the effects I was reading about.\n\nThe summer came, and we were out of school until college. About the second day out of school, I discovered some LSD at 9 AM in the morning. Whether I had eaten breakfast or not I don't remember, but i would guess NO. I was shocked looking at the two little green gel tabs, I put them in my mouth without hesitation and felt them disolve. OH WOW i thought before any of the effects kicked in, I just ate something that's going to make me trip for hours and hours seeing everything I've ever wanted to!\n\nHere I will give my previous drug experience:\nI had smoked endless amounts of pot just about every day starting about mid-junior year. I had eaten ecstacy about 5 times and I always felt uncomfortable getting an unnatural ecstatic emotion, and ecstacy is just bad for you, I say, and so does the evidence showing severe brain damage. Also at that point I had had one fun yet mild mushroom experience.\n\nI sat down at the computer to play an online game. I played about 15 minutes until the anticipation really kicked in. I started getting shaky and VERY ANXIOUS. I turned around and saw fishing poles in the corner of the room, they were taller than ever before and they towered over everything! At this point I figured I should go check things out, it's coming on. I got down on the floor and looked at my imitation oriental rug to see what was seen in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the pattern rose off the carpet, my eyes were really starting to play tricks on me.\n\nI need a shower. I get in the bathroom and the towels are breathing and pulsating, my vision was wacky. I could see small areas blown up very big and nothing other than my immediate vision. At this point I'm lost in my visuals and I'm in the shower feeling fucking great. I see a drop of water on the shower curtain and think, 'what would life be like inside a drop of water?'\n\nI'm out of the shower and decide to play my bass guitar. I put on Rage against the Machine's - Battle of LA. I am really feeling the music AND the the LSD...what a suprise! I'm softly inserting undertones on my bass, and I see the neck and strings all waving, up close, big, out of proportion, completely and utterly awesome! The anxiety is still there, STRONG, I'm trying to enjoy myself but the LSD is so freakin powerful!!!\n\nI start hearing audio hallucinations and at the same time visuals of lights turning on and off, plenty of color. The audio hallucinations sounded like the devil. Voices outside sounded like rumbling thunder. At this point I really need to talk to someone. I call my Mom at work. As soon as I start speaking I sound very loud and unusual, my Mom asks if I'm alright...what am I supposed to say, 'Well I'm on LSD!' No, that's not right.\n\nNow I REALLY need to leave my house or else the anxiety will drive me into a wall! I go outside with the phone and a cigarette. The side of my house looked like it was expanding in the upwards and downwards directions. I get in touch with my friend, who I'll call N, and I go to his house down the street to meet him and another friend A, whom were and are two of my best friends.\n\nWhen I get there I'm talking very loud and I say I think I've eaten some LSD. After a while, it is abundantly clear to them that I have. They stick by me and keep me relaxed. We drive over to a friend's house I'll call E, another best, and he has a friend chillin there. I wasn't feeling too high at this point, but everything on my mind was affecting me.\n\nI call my Mom again to talk, I tell her what happened, and she wants me home immediately. This was something I had to struggle with, I didn't wanna go home I'm out enjoying a high what good would coming home be if i'm going to get in trouble??? I decided to stay out and told my parents I would be safe and home later that evening.\n\nI go have a quality conversation with my friend A. He is a very experienced tripper of LSD and he comforts while we talk about jokes or funny experiences while the other people are out somewhere. They get back and I go for a ride with my friend N, we talk and I tell him how horrible the situation I'm in is, and that I'm in trouble. He ensures me that he is there and will help me.\n\nWe get back to E's house and then another friend shows up, he wants to smoke. Five of us head down the street to another friend's house to smoke. We sit out back and smoke dank bud out of a bubbler. My high starts to come back a little but the plateau had worn off a while ago.\n\nMy thinking goes on auto-pilot. I would think about the ramifications and harmony that come about through conversation. I decided not to speak after my thoughts flew right past the conversation.\n\nI come around after taking a piss and declare that on this day I am fucked up! At this point I feel sober enough to talk. I start to relax and my anxiety goes away. The trip slowed down and I started coming back to baseline.\n\nI decide it would be good to go home around 5 PM. When I go home I see some more visuals, talk with my parents, and make ammends. Almost a year has passed now. Since that summer, in the way of drugs I've decided not to touch cocaine, not to take LSD, ecstacy, heroine, ect...be careful, especially of the big ones...i'm serious\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this and learned a few things...\n\n\nRetrospective:\nFrom my personal experience...\n\nEating LSD at 9 AM: expect a freaking trip (see above) ^^.\nGel Tabs are potent, handle with care. I ate some 2 hits of paper/blotter about 2 months later and it wasn't a quarter as strong.\n\nHave friends & people you love to be with. \n\n","If you wake up and don't want to smile, if it take just a little while, open your eyes and look at the day.\nYou'll see things in a different way.\n\nDon't stop thinking about tomorrow.\nDon't stop, it'll soon be here.\nIt'll be better than before.\nYesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.\n\nWhy not think about times to come, and not about the things that you've done.\nIf your life was bad to you, just think what tomorrow will do.\n\nAll I want is to see you smile, if it takes just a little while.\nI know you don't believe that it's true. I never meant any harm to you.\n\n","Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelleâs and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.\nBetrothedâ¦\nâ¦betrothed couple.\nHey!\nHey!\nHi!\nHaaaa... ... ahhhh!\nPheebs?\nHuh?\nSkull?\nOh, yeah, it's my mom's.\nOh my god!!\nNo, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.\nHey!\nHey!\nLicorice?\nHey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.\nOhh! That's great!\nAre you gonna dress up as Santa?\nNope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.\nAnd maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.\nYou may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.\nHmm.\nHey.\nDid you know he was in there?\nNo.\nHow long have we been home?\nAbout a half an hour.\nLovely!\nHey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?\nNo.\nWhy not?\nBing's weird.\nOh, hey, you guys!\nHey!\nHey!\nHey. Guess what!

All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.\nOhh! You guys gonna be living together again?\nYeah, why not?\nWell, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.\nWhy do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?\nNo reason, exceptâ¦sheâ¦toldâ¦me.\nReally? So she said, she didnât wanna live with me anymore?\nNo! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.\nPhoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.\nYou're sure? You're absolutely sure?\nWell, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.\nProbably? Yeah, I don't like that word.\nBing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?\nHey!\nHey! Great, youâre home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!\nDrums?\nNo! Drums!I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.\nOh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.\nForty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.\nI'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.\nIs this because of the burrito thing?\nYou need to give him money.\nGive him money? It was a joke!\nNo, to get a table! Places like are always shakinâ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.\nRight, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.\nYou've got to be smooth about it.\nHey, I can be smooth.\nOf course, sir.\nOkay.\nHow did it go?\nHad the money in the wrong hand.\nWooooooo, hehehe.

So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?\nChristmas.\nYep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?\nChristmas eve.\nYes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.\nSanta has reindeers that can fly!\nRight, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.\nJingle bells, jingle bells...\nDreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.\nRudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...\nOkay, it's not a contest.\nWhen is Santa coming?\nWell, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?\nNo Santa? Was I bad?\nNo! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.\nSanta's mad at me.\nNo, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?

Now I only owe you $49.50.\nHey Pheebs!\nHey!\nIf you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?\nIt's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, \"Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!\" I mean, it is so annoying.\nYes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.\nPhoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?\nMaybe on some level.\nJoey, yâknow that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.\nWhat is Rock 'n' Roll about that?\nOh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?\nIt's aâ¦tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?\nWhat are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?\nIs it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!\nOh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.\nWhat? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?\nOur apartment is ready.\nAnd that makes you angry becauseâ¦\nBecause you would rather live here with Joey.\nWhere did you get that?\nMonica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.\nPhoebe?\nHm?\nDid you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!\nFish!\nIt wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.\nYes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over hereâ¦\nOh, it's so much more fun with you.\nWe did have fun, didn't we?\nWe did!\nOh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.\nOh, I would love to!\nYay, okay!\nGood, good, good, good, good.\nGreat, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.\nDone!\nHey!\nHello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?\nNo, these are my pants.\nOh. Okay! How can I help you?\nWell, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?\nTwo days before Christmas? Sorry, man.\nOkay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, Iâ¦uh, you gotta have something.\nI'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!\nWhat happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?\nSanta was unavailable so close to Christmas.\nWow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way fromâ¦Texas.\nTexas?\nThat's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.\nWow! Thanks!\nYou're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!\nAre you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.\nYou are? Me, too!\nBecause Armadillos also wandered in the desert?\nOoh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?\nCool!\nYeah!\nCome on Ben.\nYears and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...\nHo, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!\nSanta!\nHey!\nWhat are you doing here, Santa?\nWell, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weirdâ¦turtle-man?\nI'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?\nWhat?\nDid you bring me any presents, Santa?\nYou bet I did, Ben, put it there! Ho, ho, ho!\nOkay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.\nWhat are you doing?\nYou called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!\nThank you, but, but you gotta leave.\nWhy?\nBecause, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-youâre wrecking it.\nBut I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.\nI'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.\nFine, I'll give the suit back.Santa? Really?\nYes, is that okay?\nDid your Dad ever dress up like Santa?\nNo.\nThen it's okay!\nOkay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!\nNo! Why does he have to go?\nBecause, if Santa and the Holidayâ¦Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!\nNo! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!\nFine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.\nWell, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?\nOkay, Santa!\nAll right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.\nMerry Christmas!\nOh wow! Look at this place!\nOh, this is terrible. Oh, theyâve made so many changes I canât even feel my grandmotherâs presence anymoreâOoh! New sconces!\nOh my God!\nWhat?\nOkay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?\nYeah?\nAnd remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?\nYeah?\nDo you really not know where Iâm going with this? It left! Itâs one huge room!\nOh no! Oh! Wow!!!\nSee?\nWell, I guess weâll just have to put the wall back up.\nYou canât, because of the new skylight!\nThereâs a skylight?! Wow!!\nSo what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?\nYâknow Iâm-Iâm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.\nOh yeah? Startinâ to feel her again there are we?\nA little bit, yeah.\nPheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?\nYou heard her too?! You have the gift!\nPhoebe, itâs okay. I like living with Joey.\nAre you sure?\nOh please, I hate packing, itâs closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, Iâm really gonna miss living with you.\nOh me too.\nI know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, Iâm gettinâ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?\nNo, I do not hear that.\nâ¦and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldâve just lasted just one day, burned forâ¦\nEight whole days.\nThatâs right, and thatâs why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.\nAwesome!\nYeah?\nMy favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.\nThe Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, itâs time to light the Hanukkah candles!\nHey!\nOh.\nWow! It looks like the Easter Bunnyâs funeral in here.\nCome on, come on, weâre-weâre-weâre lighting the candles!\nOh.\nOh.\nOkay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunnyâs funeral?\nI got it!\nIs it back in the cage?\nIts back in cage!\nCage closed?\nJoey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!\n","Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parentâs anniversary party?\nYeah.\nSure. Yeah.\nSo, whoâs the guy?\nWell, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.\nOooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? Who said that?\nYeah, heâs really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.\nOh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?\nUh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?\nYeah, Iâd really like to.\nOkay, hopefully this time mom wonât boo you.\nYes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and itâs always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year Iâm going to make them cry.\nAnd you wonder why Ross is their favorite?\nNo! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, \"God, your brother.\" Know what theyâll say this year? \"God, you\"\nWell I can promise you, at least one person will be crying.\nReally you can do that?\nAre you kidding me? Watch! Well I canât do it with you guys watching me!\nWhat are you doing?\nOh Iâm working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out.\nItâs a dog.\nItâs a dead dog. Thatâs Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.\nItâs your parentsâ anniversary and youâre going to talk about their dead pet?\nThe good stuff, huh?\nHi!\nHey!\nHey!\nYou got a present for my parents. Thatâs so sweet.\nYeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.\nAww that is so cool.\nAnd I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.\nHey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?\nYeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, and I think my testacles may be in here too.\nAww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Yâknow Monica couldnât get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.\nWhat?!\nYou were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!\nHey!\nHi!\nEverybody, this is Parker, Parker this isâ¦\nNo, no, no wait! Donât tell me. Let me guess. Chandler, Iâm kidding all ready youâre my favorite!\nHa!\nWhy donât all of you tell me a little about your self?\nAh, actually, Iâm sorry we-we probably should get going.\nParker:\nI, uh, think you already are.\nRachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this world more miraculous thanâOh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?\nThatâs my old dog. He passed away years ago.\nOh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend, bow-wow. So whereâs the party?\nItâs out on the island. Itâs in Massapequa.\nMaaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is it steep in Native American history?\nWell, there is an Arbyâs in the shape of a tee-pee.\nOkay, I got my note cards. Do you got the presents?\nYeah.\nAnd Iâve got the car keys.\nWeâre driving!?\nYeah.\nAces!\nSo uh, he seems like a nice guy.\nYeah, yeah I like him a lot.\nYa wanna hang back and take our own cab?\nYeah, otherwise Iâm not going.\nMr. and Hi\nHi! Hey mom.\nThis is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?\nJack?\nWhy would you serve food on such a sharp stick?\nThatâs a good question, dad. Thatâs a good questionâ¦\nHmmmâ¦.\nCongratulations you two!\nThank youâ¦weâre so excited\nAnd also, congratulations on your wedding.\nWhaâWhat?\nCan we talk to you for just a yâknowâ¦ Itâs just a little thing. Well we think itâs absolutely marvelous that youâre having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why weâve told them all that youâre married.\nWhat?!\nThanks for going along with this.\nDad so what we have to pretend that weâre married?\nSon, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.\nCan you believe that?\nYeah, if youâre going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.\nNo, us having to lie about being married.\nNo, I know I donât either, but ya know what, itâs their party, and itâs just one night. And we donât even have to lie; we just wonât say anything. If it comes up again, weâll justâ¦smile. Weâll nod along.\nRoss!\nRachel!\nHi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan\nAunt Lisa: Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding\nHmmmmâ¦.\nUncle Dan: Hereâs a little something to get you started.\nOhâ¦\nAunt Lisa: So, howâs married life treating you?\nUnbelievable!\nWe love marriage!\nAunt Lisa: Great!\nHey\nHey!\nWhat a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room Câ¦I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! My God, I donât want to forget this moment! Itâs like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click!\nI donât think the flash went off.\nDahaaa! Iâm going to find the menâs room, be right back.\nIâll go with you\nCome on!\nSomewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.\nI have to go to the bathroom too, but I donât want him complimenting my thing.\nIâm so we werenât in the car! Did he ever let up?\nHe called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.Were you guys making fun of Parker?\nThat depends, how much did you hear?\nSo, he a little enthusiastic, whatâs wrong with that?\nItâs just that, itâs so much.\nWell, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people youâve dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends donât do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? âCause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the whoâs who of human crap.\nI feel terrible.\nI know\nWhat was wrong with Mona?\nOpen it! Open it! Open it!\nYeah baby!\nSo we never got to hear about your wedding!\nWe were surprise that we werenât invited.\nNo, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.\nBut it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.\nWhere did you have it?\nOn a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isnât She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.\nReally?\nYeah, Stevieâs an old family friend.\nOh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.\nSo would I. You wouldnât think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.\nWould you excuse us for a second? Ummâ¦. what are you doing?\nWhat? Iâm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.\nOkay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.\nOkay, Ross, it has to be realistic.\nAre you okay? You seem kind of quiet.\nNo, Iâm fine. Iâm great. Iâm with you.\nAnd Iâm with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this plate-bouncy thing. What an inspired solution to manâs plate dispensing problems.\nHm huh, yeah.\nAh! Oysters! Let me feed you one.\nNo, thatâs not necessary.\nPlease.\nNo, actually I donât eatâ¦\nI wonât quit until you try.\nOkay, fine! Fine! Mmmâ¦hmmmmmâ¦.\nWhat are they like? Iâve never had one.\nWhy donât you just try one?\nNo, they look too weird.\nWhat are you doinâ?\nJust going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit âem. I canât wait. Theyâre going to be crying so hard. Theyâre going to be fighting for breath.\nYa know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .\nAnd my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.\nBlind?\nWell, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.\nAunt Lisa: Iâll bet you looked beautifulâ¦\nWell, I donât know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.\nSo, how did you propose?\nOh yeah. Thatâs a great story.\nWell, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. Thatâs-thatâs where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flowerâ¦\nAunt Lisa: Oh that is so sweet!\nShhh! I want to hear the rest!\nThen, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words \"Will you marry me?\"\nAnd the ring, was the size of my fist !\nYeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parkerâs a nice guy and Iâd like to get to know him.\nThen you better do it now.\nWhy?\nBecause Iâm going to kill him\nWhat-what?\nYou guys were right. Heâs just too excited aboutâ¦everything. I mean Iâm all for living life, but this is the Gellerâs 35th anniversary. Okay? Letâs call a spade a spade this party stinks.\nI know Iâm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!\nAre you sure it wasnât an oyster?\nI guess it couldâve been, I didnât really look at it. Yâknow, I just wiped it on Chandlerâs coat and got the hell out of there.\nHeâs just such a great guy Iâm so excited about him.\nOh hey, you should be excited about him. Thereâs nothing wrong with him heâs a good guy.\nYou think?\nYeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.\nYouâre right. Youâre right, heâs just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! Iâm a sunny, positive person.\nActually, you have a little bit of an edge.\nWhatâs that now?\nNothingâ¦\nOh look itâs Parker!\nLook! Itâs the bunny hop!\nOooh I love it!\nYou do?!\nAre you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!\nOkay itâs time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year Iâm going to do it.\nNo, no itâs going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably donât say it enough, but I love you. You people are made of stone! Hereâs to mom and dad! Whatever!\nThank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasnât it interesting, Jack?\nWhy donât I remember this dog?\nRoss, why donât you give us your toast now?\nOh, no, Mom, itâs just Monica this year.\nYouâre not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary\nNo, of course, Umâ¦ Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to sayâ¦on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that ifâ¦if in 35 years, weâre half as happy as you guys are, weâll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.\nOh Rossâ¦\nI just wish Nana were alive to hear Rossâs toast.\nMy God what a fantastically well lit hallway!\nCan I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?\nI must say this apartment, its, its, There are no wordsâ¦\nOh thank God.\nItâs a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midstâ¦\nYeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why donât we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!\nThat sounds great.\nLetâs try something else, letâs play a game.\nI love games!\nShocking! Letâs play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.\nOrâ¦Jenga.\nBut, letâs play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!\nI lose, now Jenga.\nOh my God! Oh my God!\nIs something wrong?\nWrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isnât perfect? Everything isnât magical? Everything isnât a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!\nWell, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!\nYou donât have to put a good spin on everything.\nIâm sorry thatâs who I am. Iâm a positive person.\nNo! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!\nSo what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?\nMuch less happy!\nFine! Well then to quote Ross, \"Iâd better be going.\"\nSo long! Donât let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!\nIsnât this the most incredible fight youâve ever had in your entire life?\nUh huh.\nâ¦and then, we couldâve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!\nRoss, it just wouldnât have been feasible.\nBut having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldâve been no problem?\nIt was really fun being married to you tonight.\nYeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks Iâve ever made.\nOkay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?\nYeah.\nThat proposal, at the planetariumâ¦\nI know, I know it was stupid.\nAre you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It wasâ¦really wonderful! Did you just make that up?\nNo, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. Itâs how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.\nWell, that wouldâve been very hard to say no too.\nItâs a good thing I didnât do it, because it sounds like it wouldâve been a very expensive wedding. Okay, good night\nGoodnight\nEven if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnât get messed up?\nI will think about it.\nThatâs all Iâm askinâ\nOkay thatâs it. I give up. At mom and dadâs 40th anniversary, youâre the one giving the speech.\nYâknow I donât understand why they didnât cry. It was a beautiful speech.\nOh, come on.\nHey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really wouldâve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.\nOh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?\n","Article 1601: General Principles\nFurther to Article 102 (Objectives), this Chapter reflects the preferential trading relationship between the Parties, the desirability of facilitating temporary entry on a reciprocal basis and of establishing transparent criteria and procedures for temporary entry, and the need to ensure border security and to protect the domestic labor force and permanent employment in their respective territories.\nArticle 1602: General Obligations\n1.

Lyn Gibson and Wei Ling Chestnut are the widows of the two brave Capitol Hill Police officers who gave their lives to defend freedom's house.\nMr. Speaker, at your swearing in you asked us all to work together in the spirit of civility and bipartisanship. Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly that.\nTonight I stand before you to report that America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history â with nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, the highest homeownership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years â and the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957.\nFor the first time in three decades, the budget is balanced. From a deficit of $290 billion in 1992, we had a surplus of $70 billion last year AND NOW We are on course for budget surpluses for the next 25 years.\nThanks to the pioneering leadership of all of you, we have the lowest violent crime rate in a quarter century and the cleanest environment in a quarter century.\nAmerica is a strong force for peace from Northern Ireland, to Bosnia, to the Middle East.\nThanks to the pioneering leadership of Vice President Gore, we have a government for the information age, once again, a government that is a progressive instrument of the common good, rooted in our oldest values of opportunity, responsibility and community, devoted to fiscal responsibility, determined to give our people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives in the 21st century, a 21st century government for 21st century America.\nMy fellow Americans, I stand before you to report that the state of our union is strong.\nNow, America is working again. The promise of our future is limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency. How we fare as a nation far into the 21st century depends upon what we do as a nation today.\nSo with our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet our historic responsibility to the 21st century.\nOur fiscal discipline gives us an unsurpassed opportunity to address a remarkable new challenge: the aging of America.\nWith the number of elderly Americans set to double by 2030, the baby boom will become a \"senior boom.\" So first and above all, we must save Social Security for the 21st century.\nEarly in this century, being old meant being poor. When President Roosevelt created Social Security, thousands wrote to thank him for eliminating what one woman called the \"stark terror of penniless, helpless old age.\" Even today, without Social Security, half our nation's elderly would be forced into poverty.\nToday, Social Security is strong. But by 2013, payroll taxes will no longer be sufficient to cover monthly payments. And by 2032, the trust fund will be exhausted, and Social Security will be unable to pay out the full benefits older Americans have been promised.\nThe best way to keep Social Security a rock-solid guarantee is not to make drastic cuts in benefits; not to raise payroll tax rates; and not to drain resources from Social Security in the name of saving it.\nInstead, I propose that we make the historic decision to invest the surplus to save Social Security.\nSpecifically, I propose that we commit 60 percent of the budget surplus for the next 15 years to Social Security, investing a small portion in the private sector just as any private or state government pension would do. This will earn a higher return and keep Social Security sound for 55 years.\nBut we must aim higher. We should put Social Security on a sound footing for the next 75 years. We should reduce poverty among elderly women, who are nearly twice as likely to be poor as our other seniors â and we should eliminate the limits on what seniors on Social Security can earn.\nNow, these changes will require difficult but fully achievable choices over and above the dedication of the surplus. They must be made on a bipartisan basis. They should be made this year. So let me say to you tonight, I reach out my hand to all of you in both houses and both parties and ask that we join together in saying to the American people: We will save Social Security now.\nNow, last year, we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social Security. Again, I say, we shouldn't spend any of it, not any of it, until after Social Security is truly saved. First things first. Second, once we have saved Social Security, we must fulfill our obligation to save and improve Medicare. Already, we have extended the life of the Medicare trust fund by 10 years â but we should extend it for at least another decade. Tonight I propose that we use one out of every six dollars in the surplus for the next 15 years to guarantee the soundness of Medicare until the year 2020.\nBut again, we should aim higher. We must be willing to work in a bipartisan way and look at new ideas, including the upcoming report of the bipartisan Medicare commission. If we work together, we can secure Medicare for the next two decades and cover the greatest growing need of seniors â affordable prescription drugs.\nThird, we must help all Americans, from their first day on the job, to save, to invest, to create wealth. From its beginning, Americans have supplemented Social Security with private pensions and savings. Yet today, millions of people retire with little to live on other than Social Security. Americans living longer than ever simply must save more than ever.\nTherefore, in addition to saving Social Security and Medicare, I propose a new pension initiative for retirement security in the 21st century.\nI propose that we use a little over 11 percent of the surplus to establish universal savings accounts â USA accounts â to give all Americans the means to save. With these new accounts, Americans can invest as they choose, and receive funds to match a portion of their savings, with extra help for those least able to save.\nUSA accounts will help all Americans to share in our nation's wealth, and to enjoy a more secure retirement. I ask you to support them.\nFourth, we must invest in long-term care. I propose â I propose a tax credit of $1,000 for the aged, ailing or disabled and the families who care for them. Long-term care will become a bigger and bigger challenge with the aging of America â and we must do more to help our families deal with it.\nI was born in 1946, the first year of the baby boom. I can tell you that one of the greatest concerns of our generation is our absolute determination not to let our growing old place an intolerable burden on our children and their ability to raise our grandchildren. Our economic success and fiscal discipline now give us an opportunity to lift that burden from their shoulders and we should take it.\nSaving Social Security and Medicare, creating USA accounts â this is the right way to use the surplus. If we do so â if we do so â we will still have the resources to meet critical needs in education and defense. And I want to point out that this proposal is fiscally sound. Listen to this: If we set aside 60 percent of the surplus for Social Security and 16 percent for Medicare, over the next 15 years that saving will achieve the lowest level of publicly held debt since right before World War I, in 1917.\nSo With these four measures â saving Social Security, strengthening Medicare, establishing the USA accounts, supporting long-term care â we can begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to establish true security for 21st century seniors.\nNow, there are more children, from more diverse backgrounds, in our public schools than at any time in our history. Their education must provide the knowledge and nurture the creativity that will allow our nation to thrive in the new economy. Today we can say something we couldn't say six years ago: With tax credits and more affordable student loans, with more work-study grants and more Pell grants, with education IRAs and the new HOPE scholarship tax cut that more than 5 million Americans will receive this year, we have opened the doors of college to all Americans.\nThank you.\nWith our support, nearly every state has set higher academic standards for public schools, and a voluntary national test is being developed to measure the progress of our students. With over one billion dollars in discounts available this year, we are well on our way to our goal of connecting every classroom and library to the Internet.\nLast fall, you passed our proposal to start hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size in the early grades. Now I ask you to finish the job.\nYou know, our children are doing better. SAT scores are up. Math scores have risen in nearly all grades. But there's a problem: While our fourth-graders outperform their peers in other countries in math and science, our eighth-graders are around average, and our 12th-graders rank near the bottom.\nWe must do better. Now each year the national government invests more than $15 billion in our public schools. I believe we must change the way we invest that money, to support what works and to stop supporting what does not work.\nFirst, later this year, I will send Congress a plan that for the first time holds states and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results. My Education Accountability Act will require every school district receiving federal help to take the following five steps:\nFirst, all schools must end social promotion.\nNow, no child should graduate from high school with a diploma he or she can't read. We do our children no favors when we allow them to pass from grade to grade without mastering the material.\nBut we can't just hold students back because the system fails them. So my balanced budget triples the funding for summer school and after-school programs to keep a million children learning.\nIf you doubt this will work, just look at Chicago, which ended social promotion and made summer school mandatory for those who don't master the basics. Math and reading scores are up three years running â with some of the biggest gains in some of the poorest neighborhoods. It will work and we should do it.\nSecond, all states and school districts must turn around their worst performing schools â or shut them down. That's the policy established in North Carolina by Gov. Jim Hunt. North Carolina, made the biggest gains in test scores in the nation last year. Our budget includes $200 million to help states turn around their own failing schools.\nThird, all states and school districts must be held responsible for the quality of their teachers. The great majority of teachers do a fine job. But in too many schools, teachers don't have college majors â or even minors â in the subjects they teach.\nNew teachers should be required to pass performance exams, and all teachers should know the subjects they are teaching. This year's balanced budget contains new resources to help them reach higher standards.\nAnd to attract talented young teachers to the toughest assignments, I recommend a sixfold increase in our program for college scholarships for students who commit to teach in the inner cities, and isolated rural areas and in Indian communities. Let us bring excellence to every part of America.\nThank you.\nFourth, we must empower parents with more information and more choices. In too many communities, it is easier to get information on the quality of the local restaurants than on the quality of the local schools. Every school district should issue report cards on every school.\nAnd parents should have more choice in selecting their public schools. When I became president, there was one independent, public charter school in all of America. With our support, on a bipartisan basis, today there are 1,100. My budget assures that early in the next century, there will be 3,000.\nFifth, to assure that our classrooms are truly places of learning, and to respond to what teachers have been asking us to do for years, we should say that all states and school districts must adopt and implement sensible discipline policies.\nNow, let's do one more thing for our children. Today, too many of our schools are so old they're falling apart, or so overcrowded students are learning in trailers. Last fall, Congress missed the opportunity to change that. This year, with 53 million children in our schools, Congress must not miss that opportunity again. I ask you to help our communities build or modernize 5,000 schools.\nNow if, if we do these things â end social promotion, turn around failing schools, build modern ones, support qualified teachers, promote innovation, competition and discipline â then we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to create 21st century schools.\nNow we also have to do more to help the millions of parents who give their all every day at home and at work.\nThe most basic tool of all is a decent income. So Let's raise the minimum wage by a dollar an hour over the next two years.\nAnd let's make sure that women and men get equal pay for equal work by strengthening enforcement of the equal pay laws. That was encouraging, you know. There was more balance on the seesaw. I like that. Let's give 'em a hand! Give 'em â that was great.\nWorking parents also need quality child care. So again this year, I ask Congress to support our plan for tax credits and subsidies for working families, for improved safety and quality, for expanded after-school programs. Our plan also includes a new tax credit for stay-at-home parents too. They need support as well.\nParents should never have to worry about choosing between their children and their work.\nNow, the Family Medical Leave Act â the first bill I signed into law â has now since 1993 helped millions and millions of Americans to care for a new baby or an ailing relative without risking their jobs. I think with all the evidence that it has been so little burdensome to employers that we should extend family leave to 10 million more Americans working in smaller companies. And I hope you will support it.\nFinally, on the matter of work, parents should never face discrimination in the workplace. So I want to ask Congress to prohibit companies from refusing to hire or promote workers simply because they have children. That is not right.\nAmerica's families deserve the world's best medical care.\nThanks to bipartisan federal support for medical research, we are now on the verge of new treatments to prevent or delay diseases from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's, to arthritis to cancer, but as we continue our advances in medical science, we can't let our health care system lag behind.\nManaged care has transformed medicine in America â driving down costs, but threatening to drive down quality as well. I think we ought to say to every American: You should have the right to know all your medical options â not just the cheapest. If you need a specialist, you should have a right to see one. You should have the right to emergency care if you're in an accident. These are things that we ought to say, and I think we ought to say you should have a right to keep your doctor during a period of treatment, whether it's a pregnancy or chemotherapy or anything else. I believe this.\nNow, I have ordered these rights to be extended to the 85 million Americans served by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health programs.\nBut only Congress can enact the Patients' Bill of Rights for all Americans. Now, last year, last year, thank you. Last year, Congress missed that opportunity and we must not miss that opportunity again. For the sake of our families, I ask us to joint together across party lines and pass a strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights.\nThank you.\nAs more of our medical records are stored electronically, the threats to all our privacy increase. Because Congress has given me the authority to act if it does not do so by August, one way or another, we can all say to the American people we will protect the privacy of medical records and w we will do it this year.\nNow, two years ago, the Congress extended health coverage to up to 5 million children. Now, we should go beyond that. We should make it easier for small businesses to offer health insurance. We should give people between the ages of 55 and 65 who lose their health insurance the chance to buy into Medicare, and we should continue to ensure access to family planning. No one should have to choose between keeping health care and taking a job. And therefore, I especially ask you tonight to join hands to pass the landmark bipartisan legislation proposed by Senators Kennedy and Jeffords, Roth and Moynihan, to allow people with disabilities to keep their health insurance when they go to work.\nWe need to enable our public hospitals, our community, our university health centers to provide basic, affordable care for all the millions of working families who don't have any insurance. They do a lot of that today, but much more can be done. And my balanced budget makes a good down payment toward that goal. I hope you will think about them and support that provision.\nLet me say we must step up our efforts to treat and prevent mental illness. No American should ever be able â afraid, ever, to address this disease. This year we will host a White House Conference on Mental Health. With sensitivity, commitment, and passion, Tipper Gore is leading our efforts here, and I thank her for what she's done on it. Thank you. Thank you.\nAs everyone knows, our children are targets of a massive media campaign to hook them on cigarettes. Now I ask this Congress to resist the tobacco lobby, to reaffirm the FDA's authority to protect children from tobacco, and to hold the tobacco companies accountable while protecting tobacco farmers.\nSmoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars under Medicare and other programs. You know, the states have been right about this: taxpayers shouldn't pay for the costs of lung cancer, emphysema, and other smoking-related illnesses, the tobacco companies should. So tonight I announce that the Justice Department is preparing a litigation plan to take the tobacco companies to court, and with the funds we recover, to strengthen Medicare.\nNow, if we act in these areas â minimum wage, family leave, child care, health care, the safety of our children â then we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to strengthen our families for the 21st century.\nToday, America is the most dynamic, competitive, job-creating economy in history. But we can do even better in building a 21st Century economy that embraces all Americans.\nToday's incomes gap is largely a skills gap. Last year, the Congress passed a law enabling workers to get a skills grant to choose the training they need, and I applaud all of you here who were part of that. This year, I recommend a five-year commitment to the new system so that we can provide over the next five years appropriate training opportunities for all Americans who lose their jobs and expand rapid response teams to help all towns which have been really hurt when businesses close. I hope you will support this. literacy, to mount a national campaign aimed at helping the millions and millions of working people who still read at less than a fifth-grade level. We need to do this.\nHere's some good news. In the past six years, we have cut the welfare rolls nearly in half. Two years ago from this podium, I asked five companies to lead a national effort to hire people off welfare. Tonight, our Welfare to Work Partnership includes 10,000 companies who have hired hundreds of thousands of people. And our balanced budget will help another 200,000 people move to the dignity and pride of work. I hope you will support it.\nWe must do more to bring the spark of private enterprise to every corner of America, to build a bridge from Wall Street to Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta to our Native American communities. With more support for community development banks, for empowerment zones; for 100,000 more vouchers for affordable housing. And I ask Congress to support our bold new plan to help businesses raise up to $15 billion in private sector capital to bring jobs and opportunities to our inner cities and rural areas â with tax credits and loan guarantees, including the new American Private Investment Companies modeled on the Overseas Private Investment Company.\nThank you.\nNow, for years and years and years we've had this OPIC, this Overseas Private Investment Corporation, because we knew we had untapped markets overseas. But our greatest untapped markets are not overseas, they are right here at home and we should go after them.\nNow we must work hard to help bring prosperity back to the family farm. You know â as this Congress knows very well, dropping prices and the loss of foreign markets have devastated too many family farms. Last year the Congress provided substantial assistance to help stave off a disaster in American agriculture, and I am ready to work with lawmakers of both parties to create a farm safety net that will include crop insurance reform and farm income assistance.\nI actually do â I ask you to join with me and do this. This should not be a political issue. Everyone knows what an economic problem is going on out there in rural America today, and we need an appropriate means to address it. Thank you.\nWe must strengthen our lead in technology. It was government investment that led to the creation of the Internet. I propose a 28 percent increase in long-term computing research.\nWe also must be ready for the 21st century, from its very first moment, by solving the so-called \"Y2K\" computer problem. Now, we had one member of Congress stand up and applaud and we may have about that ratio out there applauding at home in front of their television sets. But remember, this is a big, big problem. And we've been working hard on it. Already we've made sure that the Social Security checks will come on time. And I â but I want all the folks at home listening to this to know that we need every state and local government, every business, large and small, to work with us to make sure that this Y2K computer bug will be remembered as the last headache of the 20th century, not the first crisis of the 21st.\nNow, for our own prosperity, we must support economic growth abroad. You know, until recently, a third of our economic growth came from exports. But over the past year and a half, financial turmoil overseas has put that growth at risk. Today much of the world is in recession, with Asia hit especially hard.\nThis is the most serious financial crisis in half a century. To meet it, the United States and other nations have reduced interest rates and strengthened the International Monetary Fund. And while the turmoil is not over, we have worked very hard with other nations to contain it.\nAt the same time, we have to continue to work on the long-term project, building a global financial system for the 21st Century that promotes prosperity and tames the cycles of boom and bust that has engulfed so much of Asia. This June I will meet with other world leaders to advance this historic purpose. And I ask all of you to support our endeavors.\nI also ask you to support creating a freer and fairer trading system for 21st century America.\nI'd like to say something really serious to everyone in this chamber in both parties. I think trade has divided us and divided Americans outside this chamber for too long. Somehow we have to find a common ground on which business and workers, and environmentalists, and farmers and government can stand together. I believe these are the things we ought to all agree on. So let me try.\nFirst, we ought to tear down barriers, open markets and expand trade. But at the same time, we must ensure that ordinary citizens in all countries actually benefit from trade â a trade that promotes the dignity of work â and the rights of workers, and protects the environment. We must insist that international trade organizations be open to public scrutiny instead of mysterious, secret things subject to wild criticism. When you come right down to it, now that the world economy is becoming more and more integrated, we have to do in the world what we spent the better part of this century doing here at home â we have got to put a human face on the global economy.\nNow we, we must enforce our trade laws when imports unlawfully flood our nation. I have, I have already informed the government of Japan that if that nation's sudden surge of steel imports into our country is not reversed, America will respond.\nWe must help all American manufacturers hit hard by the present crisis â with loan guarantees and other incentives to increase American exports by nearly $2 billion.\nI'd like to believe we can achieve a new consensus on trade based on these principles, and I ask the Congress again to join me in this common approach and to give the president the trade authority long used, and now overdue and necessary, to advance our prosperity in the 21st century.\nTonight, I also issue a call to the nations of the world to join the United States in a new round of global trade negotiation to expand exports of services, manufactures and farm products.\nTonight I say we will work with the International Labor Organization on a new initiative to raise labor standards around the world. And this year, we will lead the international community to conclude a treaty to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world.\nIf we do these things â invest in our people, our communities, our technology, and lead in the global economy â then we will begin to meet our historic responsibility to build a 21st Century prosperity for America.\nYou know, no nation in history has had the opportunity and the responsibility we now have: to shape a world that is more peaceful, more secure, more free.\nAll Americans can be proud that our leadership helped to bring peace in Northern Ireland. All Americans can be proud that our leadership has put Bosnia on the path to peace. And with our NATO allies, we are pressing the Serbian government to stop its brutal repression in Kosovo, to bring those â thank you, thank you, to bring those responsible to justice and to give the people of Kosovo the self-government they deserve.\nAll Americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for lasting peace in the Middle East. Some of you were with me last December as we watched the Palestinian National Council completely renounce its call for the destruction of Israel. Now I ask Congress to provide resources so that all parties can implement the Wye Agreement, to protect Israel's security, to stimulate the Palestinian economy, to support our friends in Jordan. We must not, we dare not, let them down. I hope you will help. Thank you.\nAs we work for peace, we must also meet threats to our nation's security, including increased dangers from outlaw nations and terrorism. We will defend our security wherever we are threatened, as we did this summer when we struck at Osama bin Laden's network of terror. The bombing of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania reminds us again of the risks faced every day by those who represent America to the world. So let's give them the support they need, the safest possible workplaces, and the resources they must have so America can continue to lead.\nWe must work to keep terrorists from disrupting computer networks. We must work to prepare local communities for biological and chemical emergencies, to support research into vaccines and treatments.\nWe must increase our efforts to restrain the spread of nuclear weapons and missiles, from Korea to India and Pakistan. We must expand our work with Russia, Ukraine and the other former Soviet nations to safeguard nuclear materials and technology so they never fall into the wrong hands.\nOur balanced budget will increase funding for these critical efforts by almost two-thirds over the next five years.\nWith Russia, we must continue to reduce our nuclear arsenals. The START II Treaty and the framework we have already agreed to for START III could cut them by 80 percent from their Cold War height.\nIt's been two years since I signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If we don't do the right thing, other nations won't either. I ask the Senate to take this vital step: Approve the Treaty now, to make it harder for other nations to develop nuclear arms and to make sure we can end nuclear testing forever.\nFor nearly a decade, Iraq has defied its obligations to destroy its weapons of terror and the missiles to deliver them. America will continue to contain Saddam, and we will work for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its people.\nNow, last month, in our action over Iraq, our troops were superb. Their mission was so flawlessly executed, that we risk taking for granted the bravery and the skill it required. Captain Jeff Taliaferro, a 10-year veteran of the Air Force, flew a B-1B bomber over Iraq as we attacked Saddam's war machine. He is here with us tonight. I'd like to ask you to honor him and all the 33,000 men and women of Operation Desert Fox. Captain Taliaferro.\nIt is time to reverse the decline in defense spending that began in 1985. Since April, together we have added nearly $6 billion to maintain our military readiness. My balanced budget calls for a sustained increase over the next six years for readiness, for modernization and for pay and benefits for our troops and their families.\nYou know, we are the heirs of a legacy of bravery represented in every community of America by millions of our veterans. America's defenders today still stand ready at a moment's notice to go where comforts are few and dangers are many, to do what needs to be done as no one else can. They always come through for America. We must come through for them.\nThe new century demands new partnerships for peace and security. The United Nations plays a crucial role, with allies sharing burdens America might otherwise bear alone. America needs a strong and effective U.N. I want to work with this new Congress to pay our dues and our debts. Thank you.\nWe must continue to support security and stability in Europe and Asia, expanding NATO and defining its new missions, maintaining our alliance with Japan, with Korea, with our other Asian allies, and engaging China.\nIn China last year, I said to the leaders and the people what I'd like to say again tonight: Stability can no longer be bought at the expense of liberty. But I'd also like to say again to the American people: It's important not to isolate China. The more we bring China into the world, the more the world will bring change and freedom to China.\nLast spring, with some of you, I traveled to Africa, where I saw democracy and reform rising, but still held back by violence and disease. We must fortify African democracy and peace by launching Radio Democracy for Africa, supporting the transition to democracy now beginning to take place in Nigeria, and passing the African Trade and Development Act. Thank you.\nWe must continue to deepen our ties to the Americas and the Caribbean, our common work to educate children, fight drugs, strengthen democracy, and increase trade.\nIn this hemisphere, every government but one is freely chosen by its people. We are determined that Cuba, too, will know the blessings of liberty.\nThe American people have opened their hearts and their arms to our Central American and Caribbean neighbors who have been so devastated by the recent hurricanes. Working with Congress, I am committed to help them rebuild. When the first lady and Tipper Gore visited the region, they saw thousands of our troops and thousands of American volunteers. In the Dominican Republic, Hillary helped to rededicate a hospital that had been rebuilt by Dominicans and Americans working side by side.\nWith her was someone else who has been very important to the relief efforts.\nYou know, sports records are made, and sooner or later, they are broken. But making other people's lives better â and showing our children the true meaning of brotherhood â that lasts forever. So for far more than baseball, Sammy Sosa, you are a hero in two countries tonight. Thank you.\nSo I say to all of you, if we do these things â if we pursue peace, fight terrorism, increase our strength, renew our alliances â we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to build a stronger 21st century America in a freer, more peaceful world.\nAs the world has changed, so have our own communities. We must make them safer, more livable and more united.\nThis year, we will reach our goal of 100,000 community police officers ahead of schedule and under budget. The Brady Bill has stopped a quarter million felons, fugitives and stalkers from buying handguns. And now, the murder rate is the lowest in 30 years, and the crime rate has dropped for six straight years.\nTonight, tonight I propose a 21st century crime bill, to deploy the latest technologies and tactics to make our communities even safer.\nOur balanced budget will help put up to 50,000 more police on the street in the areas hardest hit by crime and then to equip them with new tools, from crime-mapping computers to digital mug shots.\nWe must break the deadly cycle of drugs and crime. Our budget expands support for drug testing and treatment, saying to prisoners, \"If you stay on drugs, you have to stay behind bars,\" and to those on parole, \"If you want to keep your freedom, you must stay free of drugs.\"\nI ask Congress to restore the five-day waiting period for buying a handgun â and extend the Brady Bill to prevent juveniles who commit violent crimes from buying a gun.\nWe must do more to keep our schools the safest places in our communities.\nLast year every American was horrified and heartbroken by the tragic killings in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, Edinboro, Springfield. We were deeply moved by the courageous parents, now working to keep guns out of the hands of children, and to make other efforts so that other parents don't have to live through their loss.\nAfter she lost her daughter, Suzann Wilson of Jonesboro, Arkansas came here to the White House with a powerful plea. She said, \"Please, please, for the sake of your children, lock up your guns. Don't let what happened in Jonesboro happen in your town.\" It is a message she is passionately advocating every day.\nSuzann is here with us tonight with the first lady. I'd like to thank her for her courage and her commitment.\nIn memory of all the children who lost their lives to school violence, I ask you to strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free School Act, to pass legislation to require child trigger locks, to do everything possible to keep our children safe.\nA century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt defined our \"great, central task\" as \"leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us.\" Today, we're restoring the Florida Everglades, saving Yellowstone, preserving the red-rock canyons of Utah, protecting California's redwoods and our precious coasts.\nBut our most fateful new challenge is the threat of global warming. 1998 was the warmest year ever recorded. Last year's heat waves, floods and storms are but a hint of what future generations may endure if we do not act now.\nTonight, I propose a new clean air fund to help communities reduce greenhouse and other pollution, and tax incentives and investment to spur clean energy technologies. And I want to work with members of Congress in both parties to reward companies that take early, voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gases.\nNow, all our communities face a preservation challenge as they grow and green space shrinks. Seven thousand acres of farmland and open space are lost every day. In response, I propose two major initiatives: first, a $1 billion Livability Agenda to help communities save open space, ease traffic congestion and grow in ways that enhance every citizen's quality of life. And second, a $1 billion Lands Legacy Initiative to preserve places of natural beauty all across America, from the most remote wilderness to the nearest city park.\nThese are truly landmark initiatives, which could not have been developed without the visionary leadership of the vice president, and I want to thank him very much for his commitment here. Now, to get the most out of your community, you have to give something back. That's why we created AmeriCorps â our national service program that gives today's generation a chance to serve their communities and earn money for college.\nSo far, in just four years, 100,000 young Americans have built low-income homes with Habitat for Humanity, helped to tutor children with churches, worked with FEMA to ease the burden of natural disasters, and performed countless other acts of service that have made America better. I ask Congress to give more young Americans the chance to follow their lead and serve America in AmeriCorps.\nWe must work to renew our national community as well for the 21st century.\nLast year, the House passed the bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation sponsored by Representatives Shays and Meehan and Senators McCain and Feingold. But a partisan minority in the Senate blocked reform. So I'd like to say to the House: Pass it again, quickly. And I'd like to say to the Senate, I hope you will say yes to a stronger American democracy in the year 2000. Thank you.\nSince 1997, our Initiative on Race has sought to bridge the divides between and among our people. In its report last fall, the Initiative's Advisory Board found that Americans really do want to bring our people together across racial lines. We know it's been a long journey. For some it goes back to before the beginning of our republic, for others back since the Civil War, for others throughout the 20th century. But for most of us alive today, in a very real sense this journey began 43 years ago when a woman named Rosa Parks sat down on a bus in Alabama and wouldn't get up. She's sitting down with the first lady tonight, and she may get up or not, as she chooses.\nWe know that our continuing racial problems are aggravated, as the presidential initiative said, by opportunity gaps. The initiative I have outlined tonight will help to close them. But we know that the discrimination gap has not been fully closed, either.\nDiscrimination or violence because of race or religion, ancestry or gender, disability or sexual orientation is wrong and it ought to be illegal. Therefore, I ask Congress to make the Employment Nondiscrimination Act and the Hate Crimes Prevention Act the law of the land.\nNow, since every person in America counts, every American ought to be counted. We need a census that uses most modern scientific methods to do that.\nOur new immigrants must be part of our one America. After all, they're revitalizing our cities, they're energizing our culture, they're building up our new economy. We have a responsibility to make them welcome here, and they have a responsibility to enter the mainstream of American life. That means learning English and learning about our democratic system of government. There are now long waiting lines of immigrants that are trying to do just that. Therefore, our budget significantly expands our efforts to help them meet their responsibility. I hope you will support it.\nWhether, whether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower, on slave ships, whether they came to Ellis Island or LAX in Los Angeles, whether they came yesterday or walked this land a thousand years ago, our great challenge for the 21st century is to find a way to be one America. We can meet all the other challenges if we can go forward as one America.\nYou know, barely more than 300 days from now, we will cross that bridge into the new millennium. This is a moment, as the First Lady has said, to honor the past and imagine the future.\nI'd like to take just a minute to honor her for leading our Millennium Project, for all she's done for our children, for all she has done in her historic role to serve our nation and our best ideals at home and abroad. I honor her. Thank you.\nLast year I called on Congress and every citizen to mark the millennium by saving America's treasures. Hillary has traveled all across the country to inspire recognition and support for saving places like Thomas Edison's Invention Factory or Harriet Tubman's Home. Now we have to preserve our treasures in every community. And tonight, before I close, I want to invite every town, every city, every community to become a nationally recognized \"Millennium Community\" by launching projects that save our history, promote our arts and humanities, prepare our children for the 21st century.\nAlready, the response has been remarkable, and I want to say a special word of thanks to our private sector partners and to members in Congress, of both parties, for their support. Just one example: Because of you, the Star Spangled Banner will be preserved for the ages.\nIn ways large and small, as we look to the millennium, we are keeping alive what George Washington called \"the sacred fire of liberty.\"\nSix years ago, I came to office in a time of doubt for America, with our economy troubled, our deficit high, our people divided. Some even wondered whether our best days were behind us. But across this country, in a thousand neighborhoods, I have seen, even amidst the pain and uncertainty of recession, the real heart and character of America.\nI knew then that we Americans could renew this country.\nTonight, as I deliver the last State of the Union address of the 20th century, no one anywhere in the world can doubt the enduring resolve and boundless capacity of the American people to work toward that \"more perfect union\" of our founders' dreams.\nWe're now at the end of a century when generation after generation of Americans answered the call to greatness, overcoming Depression, lifting up the dispossessed, bringing down barriers to racial prejudice, building the largest middle class in history, winning two world wars and the \"long twilight struggle\" of the Cold War.\nWe must all be profoundly grateful for the magnificent achievements of our forbears in this century.\nYet perhaps in the daily press of events, in the clash of controversy, we do not see our own time for what it truly is: a new dawn for America.\nA hundred years from tonight, another American president will stand in this place to report on the State of the Union. He - - or she â will â will look back â he or she will look back on a 21st century shaped in so many ways by the decisions we make here and now. So let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of our time, but of their time; that we reached as high as our ideals; that we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and hopefulness; that we joined together to serve and strengthen the land we love.\nMy fellow Americans, this is our moment. Let us lift our eyes as one nation, and from the mountaintop of this American century, look ahead to the next one, asking God's blessing on our endeavors and on our beloved country.\nThank you, and good evening.\n","My girl's a liar, but I'll stand beside her.\nShe's all I've got and I don't want to be alone.\n\nMy girl don't see me when she's with my friends.\nShe's all I've got and I don't want to be alone.\n\nNo, there is no other one.\nI can't have any other one.\nThough I would, now I never could with one.\n\nAll of the drugs she does scare me real good.\nShe's got a tattoo and two pet snakes.\nNobody knows me like her.\nNobody knows her like me.\nWe're all we've got and we don't want to be alone.\n\n","I took my love, I took it down, climbed a mountain and I turned around, and I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills 'til the landslide brought it down.\nOh, mirror in the sky, what is love?\nCan the child within my heart rise above?\nCan I sail through the changin' ocean tides?\nCan I handle the seasons of my life?\n\nWell, I've been afraid of changin' 'cause I've built my life around you.\nBut time makes you bolder even children get older, and I'm getting older, too.\n\nI took my love, I took it down, I climbed a mountain and I turned around and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills, well the landslide will bring it down.\nAnd if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills, well the landslide will bring it down.\nOh, the landslide will bring it down.\n\n","Michelle, ma belle\nThese are words that go together well\nMy Michelle\n\nMichelle, ma belle\nSont des mots qui vont trÃ¨s bien ensemble\nTrÃ¨s bien ensemble\n\nI love you, I love you, I love you\nThat's all I want to say\nUntil I find a way\nI will say the only words I know that\nYou'll understand\n\nI need to, I need to, I need to\nI need to make you see\nOh, what you mean to me\nUntil I do I'm hoping you will\nKnow what I mean\n\nI love you\n\nI want you, I want you, I want you\nI think you know by now\nI'll get to you somehow\nUntil I do I'm telling you so\nYou'll understand\n\nI will say the only words I know that\nYou'll understand, my Michelle\n\n","Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the 103d Congress, my fellow Americans:\nI'm not at all sure what speech is in the TelePrompter tonightâ[laughter]âbut I hope we can talk about the state of the Union.\nI ask you to begin by recalling the memory of the giant who presided over this Chamber with such force and grace. Tip O'Neill liked to call himself \"a man of the House.\" And he surely was that. But even more, he was a man of the people, a bricklayer's son who helped to build the great American middle class. Tip O'Neill never forgot who he was, where he came from, or who sent him here. Tonight he's smiling down on us for the first time from the Lord's gallery. But in his honor, may we, too, always remember who we are, where we come from, and who sent us here. If we do that we will return over and over again to the principle that if we simply give ordinary people equal opportunity, quality education, and a fair shot at the American dream, they will do extraordinary things.\nWe gather tonight in a world of changes so profound and rapid that all nations are tested. Our American heritage has always been to master such change, to use it to expand opportunity at home and our leadership abroad. But for too long and in too many ways, that heritage was abandoned, and our country drifted.\nFor 30 years, family life in America has been breaking down. For 20 years, the wages of working people have been stagnant or declining. For the 12 years of trickle-down economics, we built a false prosperity on a hollow base as our national debt quadrupled. From 1989 to 1992, we experienced the slowest growth in a half century. For too many families, even when both parents were working, the American dream has been slipping away.\nIn 1992, the American people demanded that we change. A year ago I asked all of you to join me in accepting responsibility for the future of our country. Well, we did. We replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and reform. And I want to thank every one of you here who heard the American people, who broke gridlock, who gave them the most successful teamwork between a President and a Congress in 30 years.\nThis Congress produced a budget that cut the deficit by half a trillion dollars, cut spending, and raised income taxes on only the wealthiest Americans. This Congress produced tax relief for millions of low-income workers to reward work over welfare. It produced NAFTA. It produced the Brady bill, now the Brady law. And thank you, Jim Brady, for being here, and God bless you, sir.\nThis Congress produced tax cuts to reduce the taxes of 9 out of 10 small businesses who use the money to invest more and create more jobs. It produced more research and treatment for AIDS, more childhood immunizations, more support for women's health research, more affordable college loans for the middle class, a new national service program for those who want to give something back to their country and their communities for higher education, a dramatic increase in high-tech investments to move us from a defense to a domestic high-tech economy. This Congress produced a new law, the motor voter bill, to help millions of people register to vote. It produced family and medical leave. All passed. All signed into law with not one single veto. These accomplishments were all commitments I made when I sought this office. And in fairness, they all had to be passed by you in this Congress. But I am persuaded that the real credit belongs to the people who sent us here, who pay our salaries, who hold our feet to the fre.\nBut what we do here is really beginning to change lives. Let me just give you one example. I will never forget what the family and medical leave law meant to just one father I met early one Sunday morning in the White House. It was unusual to see a family there touring early Sunday morning, but he had his wife and his three children there, one of them in a wheelchair. I came up, and after we had our picture taken and had a little visit, I was walking off and that man grabbed me by the arm and he said, \"Mr. President, let me tell you something. My little girl here is desperately ill. She's probably not going to make it. But because of the family leave law, I was able to take time off to spend with her, the most important time I ever spent in my life, without losing my job and hurting the rest of my family. It means more to me than I will ever be able to say. Don't you people up here ever think what you do doesn't make a difference. It does.\"\nThough we are making a difference, our work has just begun. Many Americans still haven't felt the impact of what we've done. The recovery still hasn't touched every community or created enough jobs. Incomes are still stagnant. There's still too much violence and not enough hope in too many places. Abroad, the young democracies we are strongly supporting still face very difficult times and look to us for leadership. And so tonight, let us resolve to continue the journey of renewal, to create more and better jobs, to guarantee health security for all, to reward work over welfare, to promote democracy abroad, and to begin to reclaim our streets from violent crime and drugs and gangs, to renew our own American community.\nLast year we began to put our house in order by tackling the budget deficit that was driving us toward bankruptcy. We cut $255 billion in spending, including entitlements, and over 340 separate budget items. We froze domestic spending and used honest budget numbers.\nLed by the Vice President, we launched a campaign to reinvent Government. We cut staff, cut perks, even trimmed the fleet of Federal limousines. After years of leaders whose rhetoric attacked bureaucracy but whose action expanded it, we will actually reduce it by 252,000 people over the next 5 years. By the time we have finished, the Federal bureaucracy will be at its lowest point in 30 years.\nBecause the deficit was so large and because they benefited from tax cuts in the 1980's, we did ask the wealthiest Americans to pay more to reduce the deficit. So on April the 15th, the American people will discover the truth about what we did last year on taxes. Only the top 1yes, listen, the top 1.2 percent of Americans, as I said all along, will pay higher income tax rates. Let me repeat: Only the wealthiest 1.2 percent of Americans will face higher income tax rates, and no one else will. And that is the truth.\nOf course, there were, as there always are in politics, naysayers who said this plan wouldn't work. But they were wrong. When I became President, the experts predicted that next year's deficit would be $300 billion. But because we acted, those same people now say the deficit is going to be under $180 billion, 40 percent lower than was previously predicted.\nOur economic program has helped to produce the lowest core inflation rate and the lowest interest rates in 20 years. And because those interest rates are down, business investment and equipment is growing at 7 times the rate of the previous 4 years. Auto sales are way up. Home sales are at a record high. Millions of Americans have refinanced their homes, and our economy has produced 1.6 million private sector jobs in 1993, more than were created in the previous 4 years combined.\nThe people who supported this economic plan should be proud of its early results. Proud. But everyone in this Chamber should know and acknowledge that there is more to do.\nNext month I will send you one of the toughest budgets ever presented to Congress. It will cut spending in more than 300 programs, eliminate 100 domestic programs, and reform the ways in which governments buy goods and services. This year we must again make the hard choices to live within the hard spending ceilings we have set. We must do it. We have proved we can bring the deficit down without choking off recovery, without punishing seniors or the middle class, and without putting our national security at risk. If you will stick with this plan, we will post 3 consecutive years of declining deficits for the first time since Harry Truman lived in the White House. And once again, the buck stops here.\nOur economic plan also bolsters our strength and our credibility around the world. Once we reduced the deficit and put the steel back into our competitive edge, the world echoed with the sound of falling trade barriers. In one year, with NAFTA, with GATT, with our efforts in Asia and the National Export Strategy, we did more to open world markets to American products than at any time in the last two generations. That means more jobs and rising living standards for the American people, low deficits, low inflation, low interest rates, low trade barriers, and high investments. These are the building blocks of our recovery. But if we want to take full advantage of the opportunities before us in the global economy, you all know we must do more.\nAs we reduce defense spending, I ask Congress to invest more in the technologies of tomorrow. Defense conversion will keep us strong militarily and create jobs for our people here at home. As we protect our environment, we must invest in the environmental technologies of the future which will create jobs. This year we will fight for a revitalized Clean Water Act and a Safe Drinking Water Act and a reformed Superfund program. And the Vice President is right, we must also work with the private sector to connect every classroom, every clinic, every library, every hospital in America into a national information super highway by the year 2000.\nThink of it, instant access to information will increase productivity, will help to educate our children. It will provide better medical care. It will create jobs. And I call on the Congress to pass legislation to establish that information super highway this year.\nAs we expand opportunity and create jobs, no one can be left out. We must continue to enforce fair lending and fair housing and all civil rights laws, because America will never be complete in its renewal until everyone shares in its bounty.\nBut we all know, too, we can do all these things, put our economic house in order, expand world trade, target the jobs of the future, guarantee equal opportunity, but if we're honest, we'll all admit that this strategy still cannot work unless we also give our people the education, training, and skills they need to seize the opportunities of tomorrow.\nWe must set tough, world-class academic and occupational standards for all our children and give our teachers and students the tools they need to meet them. Our Goals 2000 proposal will empower individual school districts to experiment with ideas like chartering their schools to be run by private corporations or having more public school choice, to do whatever they wish to do as long as we measure every school by one high standard: Are our children learning what they need to know to compete and win in the global economy? Goals 2000 links world-class standards to grassroots reforms. And I hope Congress will pass it without delay.\nOur school to work initiative will for the first time link school to the world of work, providing at least one year of apprenticeship beyond high school. After all, most of the people we're counting on to build our economic future won't graduate from college. It's time to stop ignoring them and start empowering them.\nWe must literally transform our outdated unemployment system into a new reemployment system. The old unemployment system just sort of kept you going while you waited for your old job to come back. We've got to have a new system to move people into new and better jobs, because most of those old jobs just don't come back. And we know that the only way to have real job security in the future, to get a good job with a growing income, is to have real skills and the ability to learn new ones. So we've got to streamline today's patchwork of training programs and make them a source of new skills for our people who lose their jobs. Reemployment, not unemployment, must become the centerpiece of our economic renewal. I urge you to pass it in this session of Congress.\nAnd just as we must transform our unemployment system, so must we also revolutionize our welfare system. It doesn't work. It defies our values as a Nation. If we value work, we can't justify a system that makes welfare more attractive than work if people are worried about losing their health care. If we value responsibility, we can't ignore the $34 billion in child support absent parents ought to be paying to millions of parents who are taking care of their children. If we value strong families, we can't perpetuate a system that actually penalizes those who stay together. Can you believe that a child who has a child gets more money from the Government for leaving home than for staying home with a parent or a grandparent? That's not just bad policy, it's wrong. And we ought to change it.\nI worked on this problem for years before I became President, with other Governors and with Members of Congress of both parties and with the previous administration of another party. I worked on it with people who were on welfare, lots of them. And I want to say something to everybody here who cares about this issue. The people who most want to change this system are the people who are dependent on it. They want to get off welfare. They want to go back to work. They want to do right by their kids.\nI once had a hearing when I was a Governor, and I brought in people on welfare from all over America who had found their way to work. The woman from my State who testified was asked this question: What's the best thing about being off welfare and in a job? And without blinking an eye, she looked at 40 Governors, and she said, \"When my boy goes to school and they say what does you mother do for a living, he can give an answer.\" These people want a better system, and we ought to give it to them.\nLast year we began this. We gave the States more power to innovate because we know that a lot of great ideas come from outside Washington, and many States are already using it. Then this Congress took a dramatic step. Instead of taxing people with modest incomes into poverty, we helped them to work their way out of poverty by dramatically increasing the earned-income tax credit. It will lift 15 million working families out of poverty, rewarding work over welfare, making it possible for people to be successful workers and successful parents. Now that's real welfare reform.\nBut there is more to be done. This spring I will send you a comprehensive welfare reform bill that builds on the Family Support Act of 1988 and restores the basic values of work and responsibility. We'll say to teenagers, \"If you have a child out of wedlock, we will no longer give you a check to set up a separate household. We want families to stay together;\" say to absent parents who aren't paying their child support, \"If you're not providing for your children, we'll garnish your wages, suspend your license, track you across State lines, and if necessary, make some of you work off what you owe.\" People who bring children into this world cannot and must not walk away from them. But to all those who depend on welfare, we should offer ultimately a simple compact. We'll provide the support, the job training, the child care you need for up to 2 years. But after that, anyone who can work, must, in the private sector wherever possible, in community service, if necessary. That's the only way we'll ever make welfare what it ought to be, a second chance, not a way of life.\nI know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the same time we tackle health care. But let me point out, I think it is inevitable and imperative. It is estimated that one million people are on welfare today because it's the only way they can get health care coverage for their children. Those who choose to leave welfare for jobs without health benefits, and many entry-level jobs don't have health benefits, find themselves in the incredible position of paying taxes that help to pay for health care coverage for those who made the other choice to stay on welfare. No wonder people leave work and go back to welfare to get health care coverage. We've got to solve the health care problem to have real welfare reform.\nSo this year, we will make history by reforming the health care system. And I would say to you, all of you, my fellow public servants, this is another issue where the people are way ahead of the politicians. That may not be popular with either party, but it happens to be the truth.\nYou know, the First Lady has received now almost a million letters from people all across America and from all walks of life. I'd like to share just one of them with you. Richard Anderson of Reno, Nevada, lost his job and with it, his health insurance. Two weeks later his wife, Judy, suffered a cerebral aneurysm. He rushed her to the hospital, where she stayed in intensive care for 21 days. The Andersons' bills were over $120,000. Although Judy recovered and Richard went back to work at $8 an hour, the bills were too much for them, and they were literally forced into bankruptcy. \"Mrs. Clinton,\" he wrote to Hillary, \"no one in the United States of America should have to lose everything they've worked for all their lives because they were unfortunate enough to become ill.\" It was to help the Richard and Judy Andersons of America that the First Lady and so many others have worked so hard and so long on this health care reform issue. We owe them our thanks and our action.\nI know there are people here who say there's no health care crisis. Tell it to Richard and Judy Anderson. Tell it to the 58 million Americans who have no coverage at all for some time each year. Tell it to the 81 million Americans with those preexisting conditions. Those folks are paying more, or they can't get insurance at all. Or they can't ever change their jobs because they or someone in their family has one of those preexisting conditions. Tell it to the small businesses burdened by the skyrocketing cost of insurance. Most small businesses cover their employees, and they pay on average 35 percent more in premiums than big businesses or Government. Or tell it to the 76 percent of insured Americans, three out of four whose policies have lifetime limits. And that means they can find themselves without any coverage at all just when they need it the most. So if any of you believe there's no crisis, you tell it to those people, because I can't.\nThere are some people who literally do not understand the impact of this problem on people's lives. And all you have to do is go out and listen to them. Just go talk to them anywhere in any congressional district in this country. They're Republicans and Democrats and independents; it doesn't have a lick to do with party. They think we don't get it. And it's time we show them that we do get it.\nFrom the day we began, our health care initiative has been designed to strengthen what is good about our health care system: the world's best health care professionals, cutting-edge research and wonderful research institutions, Medicare for older Americans. None of this, none of it should be put at risk.\nBut we're paying more and more money for less and less care. Every year fewer and fewer Americans even get to choose their doctors. Every year doctors and nurses spend more time on paperwork and less time with patients because of the absolute bureaucratic nightmare the present system has become. This system is riddled with inefficiency, with abuse, with fraud, and everybody knows it. In today's health care system, insurance companies call the shots. They pick whom they cover and how they cover them. They can cut off your benefits when you need your coverage the most. They are in charge.\nWhat does it mean? It means every night millions of well-insured Americans go to bed just an illness, an accident, or a pink slip away from having no coverage or financial ruin. It means every morning millions of Americans go to work without any health insurance at all, something the workers in no other advanced country in the world do. It means that every year, more and more hard-working people are told to pick a new doctor because their boss has had to pick a new plan. And countless others turn down better jobs because they know if they take the better job, they will lose their health insurance. If we just let the health care system continue to drift, our country will have people with less care, fewer choices, and higher bills.\nNow, our approach protects the quality of care and people's choices. It builds on what works today in the private sector, to expand employer-based coverage, to guarantee private insurance for every American. And I might say, employer-based private insurance for every American was proposed 20 years ago by President Richard Nixon to the United States Congress. It was a good idea then, and it's a better idea today.\nWhy do we want guaranteed private insurance? Because right now 9 out of 10 people who have insurance get it through their employers. And that should continue. And if your employer is providing good benefits at reasonable prices, that should continue, too. That ought to make the Congress and the President feel better.\nOur goal is health insurance everybody can depend on: comprehensive benefits that cover preventive care and prescription drugs; health premiums that don't just explode when you get sick or you get older; the power, no matter how small your business is, to choose dependable insurance at the same competitive rates governments and big business get today; one simple form for people who are sick; and most of all, the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor.\nOur approach protects older Americans. Every plan before the Congress proposes to slow the growth of Medicare. The difference is this: We believe those savings should be used to improve health care for senior citizens. Medicare must be protected, and it should cover prescription drugs, and we should take the first steps in covering long-term care. To those who would cut Medicare without protecting seniors, I say the solution to today's squeeze on middle-class working people's health care is not to put the squeeze on middle-class retired people's health care. We can do better than that.\nWhen it's all said and done, it's pretty simple to me. Insurance ought to mean what it used to mean: You pay a fair price for security, and when you get sick, health care's always there, no matter what.\nAlong with the guarantee of health security, we all have to admit, too, there must be more responsibility on the part of all of us in how we use this system. People have to take their kids to get immunized. We should all take advantage of preventive care. We must all work together to stop the violence that explodes our emergency rooms. We have to practice better health habits, and we can't abuse the system. And those who don't have insurance under our approach will get coverage, but they'll have to pay something for it, too. The minority of businesses that provide no insurance at all and in so doing shift the cost of the care of their employees to others, should contribute something. People who smoke should pay more for a pack of cigarettes. Everybody can contribute something if we want to solve the health care crisis. There can't be any more something for nothing. It will not be easy but it can be done.\nNow, in the coming months I hope very much to work with both Democrats and Republicans to reform a health care system by using the market to bring down costs and to achieve lasting health security. But if you look at history we see that for 60 years this country has tried to reform health care. President Roosevelt tried. President Truman tried. President Nixon tried. President Carter tried. Every time the special interests were powerful enough to defeat them. But not this time.\nI know that facing up to these interests will require courage. It will raise critical questions about the way we finance our campaigns and how lobbyists yield their influence. The work of change, frankly, will never get any easier until we limit the influence of well-financed interests who profit from this current system. So I also must now call on you to finish the job both Houses began last year by passing tough and meaningful campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this year.\nYou know, my fellow Americans, this is really a test for all of us. The American people provide those of us in Government service with terrific health care benefits at reasonable costs. We have health care that's always there. I think we need to give every hard-working, tax-paying American the same health care security they have already given to us.\nI want to make this very clear. I am open, as I have said repeatedly, to the best ideas of concerned Members of both parties. I have no special brief for any specific approach, even in our own bill, except this: If you send me legislation that does not guarantee every American private health insurance that can never be taken away, you will force me to take this pen, veto the legislation, and we'll come right back here and start all over again.\nBut I don't think that's going to happen. I think we're ready to act now. I believe that you're ready to act now. And if you're ready to guarantee every American the same health care that you have, health care that can never be taken away, now, not next year or the year after, now is the time to stand with the people who sent us here. Now.\nAs we take these steps together to renew our strength at home, we cannot turn away from our obligation to renew our leadership abroad. This is a promising moment. Because of the agreements we have reached this year, last year, Russia's strategic nuclear missiles soon will no longer be pointed at the United States, nor will we point ours at them. Instead of building weapons in space, Russian scientists will help us to build the international space station.\nOf course, there are still dangers in the world: rampant arms proliferation, bitter regional conflicts, ethnic and nationalist tensions in many new democracies, severe environmental degradation the world over, and fanatics who seek to cripple the world's cities with terror. As the world's greatest power, we must, therefore, maintain our defenses and our responsibilities.\nThis year, we secured indictments against terrorists and sanctions against those who harbor them. We worked to promote environmentally sustainable economic growth. We achieved agreements with Ukraine, with Belarus, with Kazakhstan to eliminate completely their nuclear arsenal. We are working to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons. We will seek early ratification of a treaty to ban chemical weapons worldwide. And earlier today, we joined with over 30 nations to begin negotiations on a comprehensive ban to stop all nuclear testing.\nBut nothing, nothing is more important to our security than our Nation's Armed Forces. We honor their contributions, including those who are carrying out the longest humanitarian air lift in history in Bosnia, those who will complete their mission in Somalia this year and their brave comrades who gave their lives there. Our forces are the finest military our Nation has ever had. And I have pledged that as long as I am President, they will remain the best equipped, the best trained, and the best prepared fighting force on the face of the Earth.\nLast year I proposed a defense plan that maintains our post-cold-war security at a lower cost. This year many people urged me to cut our defense spending further to pay for other Government programs. I said, no. The budget I send to Congress draws the line against further defense cuts. It protects the readiness and quality of our forces. Ultimately, the best strategy is to do that. We must not cut defense further. I hope the Congress, without regard to party, will support that position.\nUltimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't attack each other, they make better trading partners and partners in diplomacy. That is why we have supported, you and I, the democratic reformers in Russia and in the other states of the former Soviet bloc. I applaud the bipartisan support this Congress provided last year for our initiatives to help Russia, Ukraine, and the other states through their epic transformations.\nOur support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task and vigilance for our fundamental interest and values. We will continue to urge Russia and the other states to press ahead with economic reforms. And we will seek to cooperate with Russia to solve regional problems, while insisting that if Russian troops operate in neighboring states, they do so only when those states agree to their presence and in strict accord with international standards.\nBut we must also remember as these nations chart their own futuresâand they must chart their own futuresâhow much more secure and more prosperous our own people will be if democratic and market reforms succeed all across the former Communist bloc. Our policy has been to support that move, and that has been the policy of the Congress. We should continue it.\nThat is why I went to Europe earlier this month, to work with our European partners, to help to integrate all the former Communist countries into a Europe that has a possibility of becoming unified for the first time in its entire history, its entire history, based on the simple commitments of all nations in Europe to democracy, to free markets, and to respect for existing borders.\nWith our allies we have created a Partnership For Peace that invites states from the former Soviet bloc and other non-NATO members to work with NATO in military cooperation. When I met with Central Europe's leaders, including Lech Walesa and VÐ±clav Havel, men who put their lives on the line for freedom, I told them that the security of their region is important to our country's security.\nThis year we must also do more to support democratic renewal and human rights and sustainable development all around the world. We will ask Congress to ratify the new GATT accord. We will continue standing by South Africa as it works its way through its bold and hopeful and difficult transition to democracy. We will convene a summit of the Western Hemisphere's democratic leaders from Canada to the tip of South America. And we will continue to press for the restoration of true democracy in Haiti. And as we build a more constructive relationship with China, we must continue to insist on clear signs of improvement in that nation's human rights record.\nWe will also work for new progress toward the Middle East peace. Last year the world watched Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat at the White House when they had their historic handshake of reconciliation. But there is a long, hard road ahead. And on that road I am determined that I and our administration will do all we can to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace for all the peoples of the region.\nNow, there are some in our country who argue that with the cold war, America should turn its back on the rest of the world. Many around the world were afraid we would do just that. But I took this office on a pledge that had no partisan tinge, to keep our Nation secure by remaining engaged in the rest of the world. And this year, because of our work together, enacting NAFTA, keeping our military strong and prepared, supporting democracy abroad, we have reaffirmed America's leadership, America's engagement. And as a result, the American people are more secure than they were before.\nBut while Americans are more secure from threats abroad, I think we all know that in many ways we are less secure from threats here at home. Every day the national peace is shattered by crime. In Petaluma, California, an innocent slumber party gives way to agonizing tragedy for the family of Polly Klaas. An ordinary train ride on Long Island ends in a hail of 9-millimeter rounds. A tourist in Florida is nearly burned alive by bigots simply because he is black. Right here in our Nation's Capital, a brave young man named Jason White, a policeman, the son and grandson of policemen, is ruthlessly gunned down. Violent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society, limiting personal freedom, and fraying the ties that bind us.\nThe crime bill before Congress gives you a chance to do something about it, a chance to be tough and smart. What does that mean? Let me begin by saying I care a lot about this issue. Many years ago, when I started out in public life, I was the attorney general of my State. I served as a Governor for a dozen years. I know what it's like to sign laws increasing penalties, to build more prison cells, to carry out the death penalty. I understand this issue. And it is not a simple thing.\nFirst, we must recognize that most violent crimes are committed by a small percentage of criminals who too often break the laws even when they are on parole. Now those who commit crimes should be punished. And those who commit repeated, violent crimes should be told, \"When you commit a third violent crime, you will be put away, and put away for good. Three strikes, and you are out.\"\nSecond, we must take serious steps to reduce violence and prevent crime, beginning with more police officers and more community policing. We know right now that police who work the streets, know the folks, have the respect of the neighborhood kids, focus on high crime areas, we know that they are more likely to prevent crime as well as catch criminals. Look at the experience of Houston, where the crime rate dropped 17 percent in one year when that approach was taken.\nHere tonight is one of those community policemen, a brave, young detective, Kevin Jett, whose beat is eight square blocks in one of the toughest neighborhoods in New York. Every day he restores some sanity and safety and a sense of values and connections to the people whose lives he protects. I'd like to ask him to stand up and be recognized tonight. Thank you, sir.\nYou will be given a chance to give the children of this country, the law-abiding working people of this countryâand don't forget, in the toughest neighborhoods in this country, in the highest crime neighborhoods in this country, the vast majority of people get up every day and obey the law, pay their taxes, do their best to raise their kids. They deserve people like Kevin Jett. And you're going to be given a chance to give the American people another 100,000 of them, well trained. And I urge you to do it.\nYou have before you crime legislation which also establishes a police corps to encourage young people to get an education and pay it off by serving as police officers; which encourages retiring military personnel to move into police forces, an inordinate resource for our country; one which has a safe schools provision which will give our young people the chance to walk to school in safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodging bullets. These are important things.\nThe third thing we have to do is to build on the Brady bill, the Brady law, to take further steps to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. I want to say something about this issue. Hunters must always be free to hunt. Law-abiding adults should always be free to own guns and protect their homes. I respect that part of our culture; I grew up in it. But I want to ask the sportsmen and others who lawfully own guns to join us in this campaign to reduce gun violence. I say to you, I know you didn't create this problem, but we need your help to solve it. There is no sporting purpose on Earth that should stop the United States Congress from banishing assault weapons that out-gun police and cut down children.\nFourth, we must remember that drugs are a factor in an enormous percentage of crimes. Recent studies indicate, sadly, that drug use is on the rise again among our young people. The crime bill containsâall the crime bills containâmore money for drug treatment for criminal addicts and boot camps for youthful offenders that include incentives to get off drugs and to stay off drugs. Our administration's budget, with all its cuts, contains a large increase in funding for drug treatment and drug education. You must pass them both. We need them desperately.\nMy fellow Americans, the problem of violence is an American problem. It has no partisan or philosophical element. Therefore, I urge you to find ways as quickly as possible to set aside partisan differences and pass a strong, smart, tough crime bill. But further, I urge you to consider this: As you demand tougher penalties for those who choose violence, let us also remember how we came to this sad point. In our toughest neighborhoods, on our meanest streets, in our poorest rural areas, we have seen a stunning and simultaneous breakdown of community, family, and work, the heart and soul of civilized society. This has created a vast vacuum which has been filled by violence and drugs and gangs. So I ask you to remember that even as we say \"no\" to crime, we must give people, especially our young people, something to say \"yes\" to.\nMany of our initiatives, from job training to welfare reform to health care to national service, will help to rebuild distressed communities, to strengthen families, to provide work. But more needs to be done. That's what our community empowerment agenda is all about, challenging businesses to provide more investment through empowerment zones, ensuring banks will make loans in the same communities their deposits come from, passing legislation to unleash the power of capital through community development banks to create jobs, opportunity, and hope where they're needed most.\nI think you know that to really solve this problem, we'll all have to put our heads together, leave our ideological armor aside, and find some new ideas to do even more. And let's be honest, we all know something else too: Our problems go way beyond the reach of Government. They're rooted in the loss of values, in the disappearance of work, and the breakdown of our families and our communities.\nMy fellow Americans, we can cut the deficit, create jobs, promote democracy around the world, pass welfare reform and health care, pass the toughest crime bill in history, but still leave too many of our people behind. The American people have got to want to change from within if we're going to bring back work and family and community. We cannot renew our country when within a decade more than half of the children will be born into families where there has been no marriage. We cannot renew this country when 13-year-old boys get semi-automatic weapons to shoot 9-year-olds for kicks. We can't renew our country when children are having children, and the fathers walk away as if the kids don't amount to anything. We can't renew the country when our businesses eagerly look for new investments and new customers abroad but ignore those people right here at home who would give anything to have their jobs and would gladly buy their products if they had the money to do it. We can't renew our country unless more of usI mean, all of usâare willing to join the churches and the other good citizens, people like all the ministers I've worked with over the years or the priests and the nuns I met at Our Lady of Help in east Los Angeles or my good friend Tony Campollo in Philadelphia, unless we're willing to work with people like that, people who are saving kids, adopting schools, making streets safer. All of us can do that. We can't renew our country until we realize that governments don't raise children, parents do.\nParents who know their children's teachers and turn off the television and help with the homework and teach their kids right from wrong, those kinds of parents can make all the difference. I know, I had one. I'm telling you, we have got to stop pointing our fingers at these kids who have no future and reach our hands out to them. Our country needs it, we need it, and they deserve it.\nSo I say to you tonight, let's give our children a future. Let us take away their guns and give them books. Let us overcome their despair and replace it with hope. Let us, by our example, teach them to obey the law, respect our neighbors, and cherish our values. Let us weave these sturdy threads into a new American community that can once more stand strong against the forces of despair and evil because everybody has a chance to walk into a better tomorrow.\nOh, there will be naysayers who fear that we won't be equal to the challenges of this time. But they misread our history, our heritage. Even today's headlines, all those things tell us we can and we will overcome any challenge.\nWhen the Earth shook and fires raged in California, when I saw the Mississippi deluge the farmlands of the Midwest in a 500-year flood, when the century's bitterest cold swept from North Dakota to Newport News, it seemed as though the world itself was coming apart at the seams. But the American people, they just came together. They rose to the occasion, neighbor helping neighbor, strangers risking life and limb to save total strangers, showing the better angels of our nature.\nLet us not reserve the better angels only for natural disasters, leaving our deepest and most profound problems to petty political fighting. Let us instead be true to our spirit, facing facts, coming together, bringing hope, and moving forward.\nTonight, my fellow Americans, we are summoned to answer a question as old as the Republic itself: What is the state of our Union? It is growing stronger, but it must be stronger still. With your help, and God's help, it will be.\nThank you, and God bless America.\n","Los Angeles (; Spanish for \"The Angels\"; ), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the cultural, financial, and commercial center of Southern California. With a U.S. Census-estimated 2016 population of 3,976,322, it is the second most populous city in the United States (after New York City) and the most populous city in the state of California. Located in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over 10000 ft, Los Angeles covers an area of about 469 sqmi. The city is also the seat of Los Angeles County, the most populated county in the country. Los Angeles is the center of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, with 13,131,431 residents, and is part of the larger designated Los Angeles-Long Beach combined statistical area, the second most populous in the nation with a 2015 estimated population of 18.7 million. Historically home to the Chumash and Tongva, Los Angeles was claimed by Juan RodrÃ­guez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542 along with the rest of what would become Alta California. The city was officially founded on September 4, 1781, by Spanish governor Felipe de Neve. It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the MexicanâAmerican War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, thereby becoming part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city. The completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, delivering water from Eastern California, later assured the city's continued rapid growth. Nicknamed the \"City of Angels\" in part because of how its name translates from the Spanish, Los Angeles is known for its Mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, and sprawling metropolis. The city is also one of the most substantial economic engines within the nation, with a diverse economy in a broad range of professional and cultural fields. Los Angeles is also famous as the home of Hollywood, a major center of the world entertainment industry. A global city, it has been ranked 6th in the Global Cities Index and 9th in the Global Economic Power Index. The Los Angeles combined statistical area also has a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $831 billion (), making it the third-largest in the world, after the Greater Tokyo and New York metropolitan areas. Los Angeles hosted the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympics and will host the Olympic Games for a third time in 2028.\nThe Los Angeles coastal area was settled by the Tongva (GabrieleÃ±os) and Chumash Native American tribes. A Gabrielino settlement in the area was called iyÃ¡angáº (written Yang-na by the Spanish), meaning \"poison oak place. \" Juan RodrÃ­guez Cabrillo, a Portuguese-born explorer, claimed the area of southern California for the Spanish Empire in 1542 while on an official military exploring expedition moving north along the Pacific coast from earlier colonizing bases of New Spain in Central and South America. Gaspar de PortolÃ  and Franciscan missionary Juan CrespÃ­, reached the present site of Los Angeles on August 2, 1769.\nIn 1771, Franciscan friar JunÃ­pero Serra directed the building of the Mission San Gabriel ArcÃ¡ngel, the first mission in the area. On September 4, 1781, a group of forty-four settlers known as \"Los Pobladores\" founded the pueblo they called \"El Pueblo de Nuestra SeÃ±ora la Reina de los Ãngeles de PorciÃºncula\"; in English, this translates as \"The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels of PorciÃºncula. \" The Queen of the Angels (feast day Aug. 2) is an honorific of the Virgin Mary; indeed, the present-day city still retains an active Roman Catholic Archdiocese, and as noted below, this archdiocese of Roman Catholicism remains the largest such archdiocese in the United States. Two-thirds of the settlers were mestizo or mulatto with a mixture of African, indigenous and European ancestry. The settlement remained a small ranch town for decades, but by 1820, the population had increased to about 650 residents. Today, the pueblo is commemorated in the historic district of Los Angeles Pueblo Plaza and Olvera Street, the oldest part of Los Angeles.\nNew Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and the pueblo continued as a part of Mexico. During Mexican rule, Governor PÃ­o Pico made Los Angeles Alta California's regional capital.\nMexican rule ended during the MexicanâAmerican War: Americans took control from the Californios after a series of battles, culminating with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on January 13, 1847. Railroads arrived with the completion of the Southern Pacific line to Los Angeles in 1876. Oil was discovered in the city and surrounding area in 1892, and by 1923, the discoveries had helped California become the country's largest oil producer, accounting for about one-quarter of the world's petroleum output. By 1900, the population had grown to more than 102,000, putting pressure on the city's water supply. The completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, under the supervision of William Mulholland, assured the continued growth of the city. Due to clauses in the city's charter that effectively prevented the City of Los Angeles from selling or providing water from the aqueduct to any area outside its borders, many adjacent city and communities became compelled to annex themselves into Los Angeles. Los Angeles created the first municipal zoning ordinance in the United States. On September 14, 1908, Los Angeles City Council promulgated residential and industrial land use zones. The new ordinance established three residential zones of a single type, where industrial uses were prohibited. The proscriptions included barns, lumber yards, and any industrial land use employing machine-powered equipment. These laws were enforced against industrial properties after-the-fact. These prohibitions were in addition to existing activities which were already regulated as nuisances. These included explosives warehousing, gas works, oil-drilling, slaughterhouses, and tanneries. Los Angeles City Council also designated seven industrial zones within the city. However, between 1908 and 1915, Los Angeles City Council created various exceptions to the broad proscriptions which applied to these three residential zones, and as a consequence, some industrial uses emerged within them. There are two differences from the 1908 Residence District Ordinance and later zoning laws in the United States. First, the 1908 laws did not establish a comprehensive zoning map as the 1916 New York City Zoning Ordinance did. Second, the residential zones did not distinguish types of housing: it treated apartments, hotels, and detached-single-family housing equally. In 1910, Hollywood merged into Los Angeles, with 10 movie companies already operating in the city at the time. By 1921, more than 80 percent of the world's film industry was concentrated in L.A. The money generated by the industry kept the city insulated from much of the economic loss suffered by the rest of the country during the Great Depression. By 1930, the population surpassed one million. In 1932, the city hosted the Summer Olympics. During World War II, Los Angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing, such as shipbuilding and aircraft. Calship built hundreds of Liberty Ships and Victory Ships on Terminal Island, and the Los Angeles area was the headquarters of six of the country's major aircraft manufacturers (Douglas Aircraft Company, Hughes Aircraft, Lockheed, North American Aviation, Northrop Corporation, and Vultee). During the war, more aircraft were produced in one year than in all the pre-war years since the Wright brothers flew the first airplane in 1903, combined. Following the end of World War II, Los Angeles grew more rapidly than ever, sprawling into the San Fernando Valley. The expansion of the Interstate Highway System during the 1950s and 1960s helped propel suburban growth and signaled the demise of the city's electrified rail system, once the world's largest. The 1960s saw race relations boil over into the Watts Riots of 1965 which resulted in 34 deaths and over 1,000 injuries. It was the most severe riot in the city's history until the Los Angeles riots of 1992. In 1969, Los Angeles became the birthplace of the Internet, as the first ARPANET transmission was sent from the University of California, Los Angeles to SRI in Menlo Park. In 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time. Despite being boycotted by 14 Communist countries, the 1984 Olympics became more financially successful than any previous, and the second Olympics to turn a profit until then â the other, according to an analysis of contemporary newspaper reports, being the 1932 Summer Olympics, also held in Los Angeles. Racial tensions erupted on April 29, 1992, with the acquittal by a Simi Valley jury of the police officers captured on videotape beating Rodney King, culminating in large-scale riots. They were the largest riots in US history causing approximately $1.3 billion in damage as well as 53 deaths and over 2,000 injuries. In 1994, the 6.7 Northridge earthquake shook the city, causing $12.5 billion in damage and 72 deaths. The century ended with the Rampart scandal, one of the most extensive documented cases of police misconduct in American history. In 2002, voters defeated efforts by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood to secede from the city. Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games, making Los Angeles the third city to host the Olympics three times.\nThe city is divided into over 80 districts and neighborhoods, many of which were incorporated places or communities that merged into the city. These neighborhoods were developed piecemeal, and are well-defined enough that the city has signage marking nearly all of them. More broadly, the city is divided into the following areas: Downtown Los Angeles, East Los Angeles and Northeast Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, the Harbor Area, Greater Hollywood, Wilshire, the Westside, and the San Fernando and Crescenta Valleys.\nThe city's street pattern generally follows a grid plan, with uniform block lengths and occasional roads that cut across blocks. However, this is complicated by rugged terrain, which has necessitated having different grids for each of the valleys that Los Angeles covers. Major streets are designed to move large volumes of traffic through many parts of the city; many of which are extremely long: Sepulveda Boulevard is 43 mi long, while Foothill Boulevard is over 60 mi long, reaching as far east as San Bernardino. Drivers in Los Angeles suffer from one of the worst rush hour periods in the world, according to an annual traffic index by navigation system maker, TomTom. L.A. drivers spend an additional 92 hours in traffic each year. During the peak rush hour there is 80% congestion, according to the index. Los Angeles is often characterized by the presence of low-rise buildings. Outside of a few centers such as Downtown, Warner Center, Century City, Koreatown, Miracle Mile, Hollywood and Westwood, skyscrapers and high-rise buildings are not common. The few skyscrapers that are built outside of those areas often stand out above the rest of the surrounding landscape. Most construction is done in separate units, rather than wall-to-wall. That being said, downtown Los Angeles itself has many buildings over 30 stories, with fourteen over 50 stories, and two over 70 stories (the tallest buildings west of Chicago-see List of tallest buildings in Los Angeles). Also, Los Angeles is increasingly becoming a city of apartments rather than single family dwellings, especially in the dense inner city and Westside neighborhoods.\nImportant landmarks in Los Angeles include the Hollywood Sign, Walt Disney Concert Hall, Capitol Records Building, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, Angels Flight, Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Dolby Theatre, Griffith Observatory, Getty Center, Getty Villa, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Venice Canal Historic District and boardwalk, Theme Building, Bradbury Building, U.S. Bank Tower, Wilshire Grand Center, Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles City Hall, Hollywood Bowl, Battleship, Watts Towers, Staples Center, Dodger Stadium, and Olvera Street.\nThe city of Los Angeles covers a total area of, comprising of land and of water. The city extends for 44 mi longitudinally and for 29 mi latitudinally. The perimeter of the city is 342 mi. Los Angeles is both flat and hilly. The highest point in the city proper is 5074 ft Mount Lukens, located at the northeastern end of the San Fernando Valley. The eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains stretches from Downtown to the Pacific Ocean and separates the Los Angeles Basin from the San Fernando Valley. Other hilly parts of Los Angeles include the Mt. Washington area north of Downtown, eastern parts such as Boyle Heights, the Crenshaw district around the Baldwin Hills, and the San Pedro district. Surrounding the city are much higher mountains. Immediately to the north lie the San Gabriel Mountains, which is a popular recreation area for Angelenos. Its high point is Mount San Antonio, locally known as Mount Baldy, which reaches 10064 ft. Further afield, the highest point in the greater Los Angeles area is San Gorgonio Mountain, with a height of 11503 ft}}. The Los Angeles River, which is largely seasonal, is the primary drainage channel. It was straightened and lined in {{convert of concrete by the Army Corps of Engineers to act as a flood control channel. The river begins in the Canoga Park district of the city, flows east from the San Fernando Valley along the north edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, and turns south through the city center, flowing to its mouth in the Port of Long Beach at the Pacific Ocean. The smaller Ballona Creek flows into the Santa Monica Bay at Playa del Rey.\nLos Angeles is rich in native plant species partly because of its diversity of habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains. The most prevalent plant communities are coastal sage scrub, chaparral shrubland, and riparian woodland. Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Ceanothus, Chamise, Coast Live Oak, sycamore, willow and Giant Wildrye. Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered. Though it is not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the Coral Tree (Erythrina caffra)<ref name=\"Innovation1979\"> and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise (Strelitzia reginae). Mexican Fan Palms, Canary Island Palms, Queen Palms, Date Palms, and California Fan Palms are common in the Los Angeles area, although only the last is native.\nLos Angeles is subject to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. The geologic instability has produced numerous faults, which cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes annually in Southern California, though most of them are too small to be felt. The strike-slip San Andreas Fault system is located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, and is vulnerable to the \"big one\", a potentially large and damaging event. The Los Angeles basin and metropolitan area are also at risk from blind thrust earthquakes. Major earthquakes that have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1933 Long Beach, 1971 San Fernando, 1987 Whittier Narrows, and the 1994 Northridge events. Nevertheless, all but a few are of low intensity and are not felt. The USGS has released the UCERF California earthquake forecast which models earthquake occurrence in California. Parts of the city are also vulnerable to tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960.\nLos Angeles has a Mediterranean climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification Csb on the coast, Csa inland), and receives just enough annual precipitation to avoid either KÃ¶ppen's BSh or BSk (semi-arid climate) classification. Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually. The coastal region around Los Angeles has a climate that is comparable to coastal areas of southeastern Spain such as Alicante or Elche, in temperature range and variation, in sunshine hours and as well as annual precipitation levels. Temperatures in the coastal basin exceed 90 F on a dozen or so days in the year, from one day a month in April, May, June and November to three days a month in July, August, October and to five days in September. Temperatures in the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys are considerably warmer. Temperatures are subject to substantial daily swings; in inland areas the difference between the average daily low and the average daily high is over 30 F-change. The average annual temperature of the sea is 63 Â°F, from 58 Â°F in January to 68 Â°F in August. Hours of sunshine total more than 3,000 per year, from an average of 7 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of 12 in July. The Los Angeles area is also subject to phenomena typical of a microclimate, causing extreme variations in temperature in close physical proximity to each other. For instance, the average July maximum temperature at the Santa Monica Pier is 75 Â°F}} whereas it is {{convert in Canoga Park. The city, like much of the southern California coast, is subject to a late spring/early summer weather phenomenon called \"June Gloom\". This involves overcast or foggy skies in the morning which yield to sun by early afternoon. Downtown Los Angeles averages of precipitation annually, which mainly occurs during November through March, generally in the form of moderate rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall during winter storms. Summer days are usually rainless. Rarely, an incursion of moist air from the south or east can bring brief thunderstorms in late summer, especially to the mountains. The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the inland and mountain areas get considerably more. Years of average rainfall are rare. The usual pattern is year to year variability, with a short string of dry years of 5 â rainfall, followed by one or two wet years with more than 20 in. Wet years are usually associated with warm water El NiÃ±o conditions in the Pacific, dry years with cooler water La NiÃ±a episodes. A series of rainy days can bring floods to the lowlands and mudslides to the hills, especially after wildfires have denuded the slopes. Both freezing temperatures and snowfall are extremely rare in the city basin and along the coast, with the last occurrence of a 32 Â°F}} reading at the downtown station being January 29, 1979; freezing temperatures occur nearly every year in valley locations while the mountains within city limits typically receive snowfall every winter. The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was on September 27, 2010, while the lowest is 28 Â°F}}, on January 4, 1949. During autumn and winter, Santa Ana winds sometimes bring much warmer and drier conditions to Los Angeles, and raise the wildfire risk. {{Los Angeles weatherbox {{Weather box\nA Gabrielino settlement in the area was called iyÃ¡angáº (written Yang-na by the Spanish), which has been translated as \"poison oak place\". Yang-na has also been translated as \"the valley of smoke\". Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog. The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources. The smog season lasts from approximately May to October. While other large cities rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 in of rain each year: pollution accumulates over many consecutive days. Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act. More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low-emission vehicles. Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years because of aggressive steps to reduce it, which include electric and hybrid cars, improvements in mass transit, and other measures. The number of Stage 1 smog alerts in Los Angeles has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium. Despite improvement, the 2006 and 2007 annual reports of the American Lung Association ranked the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution. In 2008, the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year-round particulate pollution. The city met its goal of providing 20 percent of the city's power from renewable sources in 2010. The American Lung Association's 2013 survey ranks the metro area as having the nation's worst smog, and fourth in both short-term and year-round pollution amounts. Los Angeles is also home to the nation's largest urban oil field. There are more than 700 active oil wells located within 1,500 feet of homes, churches, schools and hospitals in the city, a situation about which the EPA has voiced serious concerns.\n{{US Census population The 2010 United States Census reported that Los Angeles had a population of 3,792,621. The population density was 8,092.3 people per square mile (2,913.0/kmÂ²). The age distribution was 874,525 people under 18, 434,478 people (11.5%) from 18 to 24, 1,209,367 people (31.9%) from 25 to 44, 877,555 people (23.1%) from 45 to 64, and 396,696 people (10.5%) who were 65 or older.

The homeowner vacancy rate was 2.1%; the rental vacancy rate was 6.1%. 1,535,444 people (40.5% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 2,172,576 people lived in rental housing units. According to the 2010 United States Census, Los Angeles had a median household income of $49,497, with 22.0% of the population living below the federal poverty line.\nAccording to the 2010 Census, the racial makeup of Los Angeles included: 1,888,158 Whites, 365,118 African Americans (9.6%), 28,215 Native Americans (0.7%), 426,959 Asians (11.3%), 5,577 Pacific Islanders (0.1%), 902,959 from other races (23.8%), and 175,635 (4.6%) from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 1,838,822 persons . Los Angeles is home to people from more than 140 countries speaking 224 different identified languages. Ethnic enclaves like Chinatown, Historic Filipinotown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, Little Ethiopia, Tehrangeles, Little Tokyo, Little Bangladesh, and Thai Town provide examples of the polyglot character of Los Angeles. Non-Hispanic whites were 28.7% of the population in 2010, compared to 86.3% in 1940. The majority of the Non-Hispanic white population is living in areas along the Pacific coast as well as in neighborhoods near and on the Santa Monica Mountains from the Pacific Palisades to Los Feliz. Mexican ancestry make up the largest ethnic group of Hispanics at 31.9% of Los Angeles's population, followed by those of Salvadoran and Guatemalan (3.6%) heritage. The Hispanic population has a long established Mexican-American and Central American community and is spread well-nigh throughout the entire city of Los Angeles and its metropolitan area. It is most heavily concentrated in regions around Downtown as East Los Angeles, Northeast Los Angeles and Westlake. Furthermore, a vast majority of residents in neighborhoods in eastern South Los Angeles towards Downey are of Hispanic origin. The largest Asian ethnic groups are and Koreans (2.9%), which have their own established ethnic enclavesâKoreatown in the Wilshire Center and Historic Filipinotown. Chinese people, which make up 1.8% of Los Angeles's population, reside mostly outside of Los Angeles city limits and rather in the San Gabriel Valley of eastern Los Angeles County, but make a sizable presence in the city, notably in Chinatown. Chinatown and Thaitown are also home to many Thais and Cambodians, which make up 0.3% and 0.1% of Los Angeles's population, respectively. Japanese comprise 0.9% of L.A.'s population, and have an established Little Tokyo in the city's downtown, and another significant community of Japanese Americans is located in the Sawtelle district of West Los Angeles. Vietnamese make up 0.5% of Los Angeles's population. Indians make up 0.9% of the city's population. The Los Angeles metropolitan area is home to a large population of Armenians and Iranians, many of whom live in enclaves like Little Armenia and Tehrangeles. African Americans have been the predominant ethnic group in South Los Angeles, which has emerged as the largest African American community in the western United States since the 1960s. The neighborhoods of South LA with highest concentration of African Americans include Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills, Leimert Park, Hyde Park, Gramercy Park, Manchester Square and Watts. Apart from South Los Angeles, neighborhoods in the Central region of Los Angeles, as Mid-City and Mid-Wilshire have a moderate concentration of African Americans as well. In 1970, the Census Bureau reported the city's population as 17.9% black, 61.1% non-Hispanic white and 17.1% Hispanic.\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Christianity is the most prevalently practiced religion in Los Angeles . Perhaps owing to the fact of its founding by Franciscan friars of Roman Catholicism, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles leads the largest archdiocese in the country. Cardinal Roger Mahony oversaw construction of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which opened in September 2002 in downtown Los Angeles. Construction of the cathedral marked a coming of age of the city's Catholic, heavily Latino community. There are numerous Catholic churches and parishes throughout Los Angeles. In 2011, the once common, but ultimately lapsed, custom of conducting a procession and Mass in honor of Nuestra SeÃ±ora de los Ãngeles, in commemoration of the founding of the City of Los Angeles in 1781, was revived by the Queen of Angels Foundation and its founder Mark Albert, with the support and approbation of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles as well as several civic leaders. The recently revived custom is a continuation of the original processions and Masses which commenced on the first anniversary of the founding of Los Angeles in 1782 and continued for nearly a century thereafter. With 621,000 Jews in the metropolitan area (490,000 in city proper), the region has the second largest population of Jews in the United States. Many of Los Angeles's Jews now live on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley, though Boyle Heights and Northwest Los Angeles once had large Jewish populations. Many varieties of Judaism are represented in the area, including Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, and Reconstructionist. The Breed Street Shul in East Los Angeles, built in 1923, was the largest synagogue west of Chicago in its early decades. (It is no longer a sacred space and is being converted to a museum and community center.) The Kabbalah Centre also has a presence in the city. The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel was founded in Los Angeles by Aimee Semple McPherson in 1923 and remains headquartered there to this day. For many years, the church convened at Angelus Temple, which, when built, was one of the largest churches in the country. Los Angeles has had a rich and influential Protestant tradition. The first Protestant service in Los Angeles was a Methodist meeting held in a private home in 1850 and the oldest Protestant church still operating, First Congregational Church, was founded in 1867. In the early 1900s the Bible Institute Of Los Angeles published the founding documents of the Christian Fundamentalist movement and the Azusa Street Revival launched Pentecostalism. The Metropolitan Community Church also had its origins in the Los Angeles area. Important churches in the city include First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, Bel Air Presbyterian Church, First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles, West Angeles Church of God in Christ, Second Baptist Church, Crenshaw Christian Center, McCarty Memorial Christian Church, and First Congregational Church. The Los Angeles California Temple, the second largest temple operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is on Santa Monica Boulevard in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Dedicated in 1956, it was the first LDS temple built in California and it was the largest in the world when completed. The Hollywood region of Los Angeles also has several significant headquarters, churches, and the Celebrity Center of Scientology. Because of Los Angeles's large multi-ethnic population, a wide variety of faiths are practiced, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, BahÃ¡'Ã­, various Eastern Orthodox Churches, Sufism and others. Immigrants from Asia for example, have formed a number of significant Buddhist congregations making the city home to the greatest variety of Buddhists in the world. The first Buddhist joss house was founded in the city in 1875. Atheism and other secular beliefs are also common, as the city is the largest in the Western U.S. Unchurched Belt.\nThe economy of Los Angeles is driven by international trade, entertainment (television, motion pictures, video games, music recording, and production), aerospace, technology, petroleum, fashion, apparel, and tourism. Other significant industries include finance, telecommunications, law, healthcare, and transportation. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Los Angeles was ranked as having the 19th most competitive financial center in the world, and sixth most competitive in United States (after New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, D.C.). Two of the six major film studios, Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox, are located within the city limits, their locations being part of the so-called \"Thirty-Mile Zone\" of entertainment headquarters in Southern California. Los Angeles is the largest manufacturing center in the western United States. The contiguous ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach together comprise the fifth-busiest port in the world and the most significant port in the Western Hemisphere and is vital to trade within the Pacific Rim.

Talent is locally cultivated at premier institutions such as the Colburn School and the USC Thornton School of Music.\nThere are 841 museums and art galleries in Los Angeles County.<ref name=\"lmu\"> In fact, Los Angeles has more museums per capita than any other city in the world. Some of the notable museums are the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (the largest art museum in the Western United States ), the Getty Center (part of the larger [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], the world's wealthiest art institution ), the Battleship Iowa, and the Museum of Contemporary Art.

Both left the city in 1995, with the Rams moving to St. Louis, and the Raiders moving back to their original home of Oakland. After 21 seasons in St. Louis, on January 12, 2016, the NFL announced that the Rams would be moving back to Los Angeles for the 2016 NFL season. A new stadium will be built in Inglewood, California for the team by the 2020 season. Prior to 1995, the Rams played their home games in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum from 1946 to 1979 and the Raiders played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum from 1982 to 1994. The San Diego Chargers announced on January 12, 2017 that they would relocate to Los Angeles and become the Los Angeles Chargers beginning in the 2017 NFL season and play at the StubHub Center in Carson, California for the next three seasons until the Rams' Inglewood stadium is completed. Los Angeles has twice hosted the Summer Olympic Games: in 1932 and in 1984, and will host the games for a third time in 2028. Los Angeles will be the third city after London (1908, 1948 and 2012) and Paris (1900, 1924 and 2024) to host the Olympic Games three times.

The Forum, the StubHub Center, and the Rose Bowl are also located in adjacent cities.\nLos Angeles is a charter city as opposed to a general law city. The current charter was adopted on June 8, 1999 and has been amended many times since then. The elected government consists of the Los Angeles City Council and the Mayor of Los Angeles which operate under a mayor-council government, as well as the city attorney (not to be confused with the district attorney, a county office) and controller. The current mayor is Eric Garcetti. There are 15 city council districts. The city has many departments and appointed officers, including the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA), the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT), and the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL). The Charter of the City of Los Angeles ratified by voters in 1999 created a system of advisory neighborhood councils that would represent the diversity of stakeholders, defined as those who live, work or own property in the neighborhood. The neighborhood councils are relatively autonomous and spontaneous in that they identify their own boundaries, establish their own bylaws, and elect their own officers. There are currently about 90 neighborhood councils. Residents of Los Angeles elect supervisors for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th supervisorial districts.\nIn the California State Assembly, Los Angeles is split between fourteen districts. In the California State Senate, the city is split between eight districts. In the United States House of Representatives, it is split between ten congressional districts.\nLos Angeles experienced a significant decline in crime in the 1990s and late 2000s and reached a 50-year low in 2009 with 314 homicides. This is a rate of 7.85 per 100,000 populationâa major decrease from 1980 when a homicide rate of 34.2 per 100,000 was reported. This included 15 officer-involved shootings. One shooting led to the death of a SWAT team member, Randal Simmons, the first in LAPD's history. Los Angeles in the year of 2013 totaled 251 murders, a decrease of 16 percent from the previous year. Police speculate that the drop resulted from a number of factors, including young people spending more time online. Crime increased significantly in 2015 from the low in 2013 with the rate of aggravated assault up 76%, rape up 182.7% and murder up 9.2%. The Dragna crime family and the Cohen crime family dominated organized crime in the city during the Prohibition era and reached its peak during the 1940s and 1950s with the battle of Sunset Strip as part of the American Mafia, but has gradually declined since then with the rise of various black and Hispanic gangs in the late 1960s and early 1970s. According to the Los Angeles Police Department, the city is home to 45,000 gang members, organized into 450 gangs. Among them are the Crips and Bloods, which are both African American street gangs that originated in the South Los Angeles region. Latino street gangs such as the SureÃ±os, a Mexican American street gang, and Mara Salvatrucha, which has mainly members of Salvadoran descent, all originated in Los Angeles. This has led to the city being referred to as the \"Gang Capital of America\".\nThere are three public universities located within the city limits: California State University, Los Angeles, California State University, Northridge (CSUN) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

After Proposition 13 was approved in 1978, urban school districts had considerable trouble with funding. LAUSD has become known for its underfunded, overcrowded and poorly maintained campuses, although its 162 Magnet schools help compete with local private schools. Several small sections of Los Angeles are in the Las Virgenes Unified School District. The Los Angeles County Office of Education operates the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts.

Los Angeles and New York City are the only two media markets to have seven VHF allocations assigned to them. As part of the region's aforementioned creative industry, the Big Four major broadcast television networks, ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC, all have production facilities and offices throughout various areas of Los Angeles. All four major broadcast television networks, plus major Spanish-language networks Telemundo and Univision, also own and operate stations that both serve the Los Angeles market and serve as each network's West Coast flagship station: ABC's KABC-TV (Channel 7), CBS's KCBS-TV (Channel 2), Fox's KTTV-TV (Channel 11), NBC's KNBC-TV (Channel 4), Telemundo's KVEA-TV (Channel 52), and Univision's KMEX-TV (Channel 34).
