To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air.\n\n","yah.","EVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go\nand play in the Giant’s garden.\n\nIt was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass.  Here and there over\nthe grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve\npeach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of\npink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit.  The birds sat on the\ntrees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in\norder to listen to them.  “How happy we are here!” they cried to each\nother.\n\n\nOne day the Giant came back.  He had been to visit his friend the Cornish\nogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.  After the seven years\nwere over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was\nlimited, and he determined to return to his own castle.  When he arrived\nhe saw the children playing in the garden.\n\n“What are you doing here?” he cried in a very gruff voice, and the\nchildren ran away.\n\n“My own garden is my own garden,” said the Giant; “any one can understand\nthat, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.”  So he built a\nhigh wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.\n\nTRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED\n\nHe was a very selfish Giant.\n\nThe poor children had now nowhere to play.  They tried to play on the\nroad, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did\nnot like it.  They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons\nwere over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.  “How happy we\nwere there,” they said to each other.\n\nThen the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms\nand little birds.  Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still\nwinter.  The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children,\nand the trees forgot to blossom.  Once a beautiful flower put its head\nout from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for\nthe children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to\nsleep.  The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost.\n“Spring has forgotten this garden,” they cried, “so we will live here all\nthe year round.”  The Snow covered up the grass with her great white\ncloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver.  Then they invited the\nNorth Wind to stay with them, and he came.  He was wrapped in furs, and\nhe roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down.\n“This is a delightful spot,” he said, “we must ask the Hail on a visit.”\nSo the Hail came.  Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of\nthe castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and\nround the garden as fast as he could go.  He was dressed in grey, and his\nbreath was like ice.\n\n“I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,” said the\nSelfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white\ngarden; “I hope there will be a change in the weather.”\n\nBut the Spring never came, nor the Summer.  The Autumn gave golden fruit\nto every garden, but to the Giant’s garden she gave none.  “He is too\nselfish,” she said.  So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind,\nand the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.\n\nOne morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely\nmusic.  It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the\nKing’s musicians passing by.  It was really only a little linnet singing\noutside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in\nhis garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the\nworld.  Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind\nceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open\ncasement.  “I believe the Spring has come at last,” said the Giant; and\nhe jumped out of bed and looked out.\n\nWhat did he see?\n\nHe saw a most wonderful sight.  Through a little hole in the wall the\nchildren had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the\ntrees.  In every tree that he could see there was a little child.  And\nthe trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had\ncovered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above\nthe children’s heads.  The birds were flying about and twittering with\ndelight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and\nlaughing.  It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter.\nIt was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little\nboy.  He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the\ntree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.  The poor tree\nwas still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was\nblowing and roaring above it.  “Climb up! little boy,” said the Tree, and\nit bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.\n\nAnd the Giant’s heart melted as he looked out.  “How selfish I have\nbeen!” he said; “now I know why the Spring would not come here.  I will\nput that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock\ndown the wall, and my garden shall be the children’s playground for ever\nand ever.”  He was really very sorry for what he had done.\n\nSo he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went\nout into the garden.  But when the children saw him they were so\nfrightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.\nOnly the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that\nhe did not see the Giant coming.  And the Giant stole up behind him and\ntook him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.  And the tree\nbroke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the\nlittle boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant’s\nneck, and kissed him.  And the other children, when they saw that the\nGiant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came\nthe Spring.  “It is your garden now, little children,” said the Giant,\nand he took a great axe and knocked down the wall.  And when the people\nwere going to market at twelve o’clock they found the Giant playing with\nthe children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.\n\nAll day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to\nbid him good-bye.\n\n“But where is your little companion?” he said: “the boy I put into the\ntree.”  The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.\n\n“We don’t know,” answered the children; “he has gone away.”\n\n“You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,” said the Giant.\nBut the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had\nnever seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.\n\nEvery afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with\nthe Giant.  But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.\nThe Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first\nlittle friend, and often spoke of him.  “How I would like to see him!” he\nused to say.\n\nYears went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble.  He could not\nplay about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the\nchildren at their games, and admired his garden.  “I have many beautiful\nflowers,” he said; “but the children are the most beautiful flowers of\nall.”\n\nOne winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing.  He\ndid not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring\nasleep, and that the flowers were resting.\n\nSuddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked.  It\ncertainly was a marvellous sight.  In the farthest corner of the garden\nwas a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.  Its branches were\nall golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood\nthe little boy he had loved.\n\nDownstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden.  He\nhastened across the grass, and came near to the child.  And when he came\nquite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, “Who hath dared to\nwound thee?”  For on the palms of the child’s hands were the prints of\ntwo nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.\n\n“Who hath dared to wound thee?” cried the Giant; “tell me, that I may\ntake my big sword and slay him.”\n\n“Nay!” answered the child; “but these are the wounds of Love.”\n\n“Who art thou?” said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he\nknelt before the little child.\n\nAnd the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, “You let me play once\nin your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is\nParadise.”\n\nAnd when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying\ndead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.\n\n","Werner Karl Heisenberg (; ; 5 December 1901 – 1 February 1976) was a German theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics. He published his work in 1925 in a breakthrough paper. In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, during the same year, this matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated. He is known for the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which he published in 1927. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 \"for the creation of quantum mechanics\". He also made important contributions to the theories of the hydrodynamics of turbulent flows, the atomic nucleus, ferromagnetism, cosmic rays, and subatomic particles, and he was instrumental in planning the first West German nuclear reactor at Karlsruhe, together with a research reactor in Munich, in 1957. He was a principal scientist in the Nazi German nuclear weapon project during World War II. He travelled to occupied Copenhagen where he met and discussed the German project with Niels Bohr. Following World War II, he was appointed director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, which soon thereafter was renamed the Max Planck Institute for Physics. He was director of the institute until it was moved to Munich in 1958, when it was expanded and renamed the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics. Heisenberg was also president of the German Research Council, chairman of the Commission for Atomic Physics, chairman of the Nuclear Physics Working Group, and president of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.\nWerner Karl Heisenberg was born in Würzburg, Germany, to, a secondary school teacher of classical languages who became Germany's only ordentlicher Professor (ordinarius professor) of medieval and modern Greek studies in the university system, and his wife, Annie Wecklein. He studied physics and mathematics from 1920 to 1923 at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München and the Georg-August-Universität Göttingen. At Munich, he studied under Arnold Sommerfeld and Wilhelm Wien. At Göttingen, he studied physics with Max Born and James Franck, and he studied mathematics with David Hilbert. He received his doctorate in 1923, at Munich under Sommerfeld. He completed his Habilitation in 1924, at Göttingen under Born. Because Sommerfeld had a sincere interest in his students and knew of Heisenberg's interest in Niels Bohr's theories on atomic physics, Sommerfeld took Heisenberg to Göttingen to the Bohr-Festspiele (Bohr Festival) in June 1922. At the event, Bohr was a guest lecturer and gave a series of comprehensive lectures on quantum atomic physics. There, Heisenberg met Bohr for the first time, and it had a significant and continuing effect on him. Heisenberg's doctoral thesis, the topic of which was suggested by Sommerfeld, was on turbulence; the thesis discussed both the stability of laminar flow and the nature of turbulent flow. The problem of stability was investigated by the use of the Orr–Sommerfeld equation, a fourth order linear differential equation for small disturbances from laminar flow. He briefly returned to this topic after World War II. Heisenberg's paper on the anomalous Zeeman effect was accepted as his Habilitationsschrift (Habilitation thesis) under Max Born at Göttingen. In his youth he was a member and Scoutleader of the Neupfadfinder, a German Scout association and part of the German Youth Movement. In August 1923 Robert Honsell and Heisenberg organized a trip (Großfahrt) to Finland with a Scout group of this association from Munich. Heisenberg arrived at Munich in 1919 as a member of Freikorps to fight the Bavarian Soviet Republic established a year earlier. Five decades later he recalled those days as youthful fun, like \"playing cops and robbers and so on; it was nothing serious at all. \"\nFrom 1924 to 1927, Heisenberg was a Privatdozent at Göttingen. From 17 September 1924 to 1 May 1925, under an International Education Board Rockefeller Foundation fellowship, Heisenberg went to do research with Niels Bohr, director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen. His seminal paper, Über quantentheoretischer Umdeutung was published in September 1925. He returned to Göttingen and with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, over a period of about six months, developed the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics. On 1 May 1926, Heisenberg began his appointment as a university lecturer and assistant to Bohr in Copenhagen. It was in Copenhagen, in 1927, that Heisenberg developed his uncertainty principle, while working on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. On 23 February, Heisenberg wrote a letter to fellow physicist Wolfgang Pauli, in which he first described his new principle. In his paper on the uncertainty principle, Heisenberg used the word \"Ungenauigkeit\" (imprecision). In 1927, Heisenberg was appointed ordentlicher Professor (ordinarius professor) of theoretical physics and head of the department of physics at the Universität Leipzig; he gave his inaugural lecture on 1 February 1928. In his first paper published from Leipzig, Heisenberg used the Pauli exclusion principle to solve the mystery of ferromagnetism. In Heisenberg's tenure at Leipzig, the quality of doctoral students, post-graduate and research associates who studied and worked with Heisenberg there is attested to by the acclaim later earned by these people; at various times. They included Erich Bagge, Felix Bloch, Ugo Fano, Siegfried Flügge, William Vermillion Houston, Friedrich Hund, Robert S. Mulliken, Rudolf Peierls, George Placzek, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Fritz Sauter, John C. Slater, Edward Teller, John Hasbrouck van Vleck, Victor Frederick Weisskopf, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Gregor Wentzel and Clarence Zener. In early 1929, Heisenberg and Pauli submitted the first of two papers laying the foundation for relativistic quantum field theory. Also in 1929, Heisenberg went on a lecture tour in China, Japan, India, and the United States. In the spring of 1929, he was a visiting lecturer at the University of Chicago, where he lectured on quantum mechanics. Shortly after the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932, Heisenberg submitted the first of three papers on his neutron-proton model of the nucleus. He was awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1928, the British mathematical physicist P. A. M. Dirac had derived the relativistic wave equation of quantum mechanics, which implied the existence of positive electrons, later to be named positrons. In 1932, from a cloud chamber photograph of cosmic rays, the American physicist Carl David Anderson identified a track as having been made by a positron. In mid-1933, Heisenberg presented his theory of the positron. His thinking on Dirac's theory and further development of the theory were set forth in two papers. The first, ''Bemerkungen zur Diracschen Theorie des Positrons (Remarks on Dirac's theory of the positron) was published in 1934, and the second, Folgerungen aus der Diracschen Theorie des Positrons (Consequences of Dirac's Theory of the Positron)'', was published in 1936. In these papers Heisenberg was the first to reinterpret the Dirac equation as a \"classical\" field equation for any point particle of spin ħ/2, itself subject to quantization conditions involving anti-commutators. Thus reinterpreting it as a (quantum) field equation accurately describing electrons, Heisenberg put matter on the same footing as electromagnetism: as being described by relativistic quantum field equations which allowed the possibility of particle creation and destruction. (Hermann Weyl had already described this in a 1929 letter to Einstein.) In the early 1930s in Germany, the Deutsche Physik movement was anti-Semitic and anti-theoretical physics, especially including quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity. As applied in the university environment, political factors took priority over the historically applied concept of scholarly ability, even though its two most prominent supporters were the Nobel Laureates in Physics Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark. After Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Heisenberg was attacked in the press as a \"White Jew\" by elements of the Deutsche Physik (German Physics) movement for his insistence on teaching about the roles of Jewish scientists. As a result, he came under investigation by the SS. This was over an attempt to appoint Heisenberg as successor to Arnold Sommerfeld at the University of Munich. The issue was resolved in 1938 by Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS. While Heisenberg was not chosen as Sommerfeld's successor, he was rehabilitated to the physics community during the Third Reich. Nevertheless, supporters of Deutsche Physik launched vicious attacks against leading theoretical physicists, including Arnold Sommerfeld and Heisenberg. On 29 June 1936, a Nazi Party newspaper published a column attacking Heisenberg. On 15 July 1937, he was attacked in a journal of the SS. This was the beginning of what is called the Heisenberg Affair. In mid-1936, Heisenberg presented his theory of cosmic-ray showers in two papers. Four more papers  appeared in the next two years. In June 1939, Heisenberg bought a summer home for his family in Urfeld am Walchensee, in southern Germany. He also travelled to the United States in June and July, visiting Samuel Abraham Goudsmit, at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. However, Heisenberg refused an invitation to emigrate to the United States. He did not see Goudsmit again until six years later, when Goudsmit was the chief scientific advisor to the American Operation Alsos at the close of World War II. Ironically, Heisenberg was arrested under Operation Alsos and detained in England under Operation Epsilon.\nHeisenberg’s paper establishing quantum mechanics has puzzled physicists and historians. His methods assume that the reader is familiar with Kramers-Heisenberg transition probability calculations. The main new idea, noncommuting matrices, is justified only by a rejection of unobservable quantities. It introduces the non-commutative multiplication of matrices by physical reasoning, based on the correspondence principle, despite the fact that Heisenberg was not then familiar with the mathematical theory of matrices. The path leading to these results has been reconstructed in MacKinnon, 1977, and the detailed calculations are worked out in Aitchison et al. In Copenhagen, Heisenberg and Hans Kramers collaborated on a paper on dispersion, or the scattering from atoms of radiation whose wavelength is larger than the atoms. They showed that the successful formula Kramers had developed earlier could not be based on Bohr orbits, because the transition frequencies are based on level spacings which are not constant. The frequencies which occur in the Fourier transform of sharp classical orbits, by contrast, are equally spaced. But these results could be explained by a semi-classical Virtual State model: the incoming radiation excites the valence, or outer, electron to a virtual state from which it decays. In a subsequent paper Heisenberg showed that this virtual oscillator model could also explain the polarization of fluorescent radiation. These two successes, and the continuing failure of the Bohr-Sommerfeld model to explain the outstanding problem of the anomalous Zeeman effect, led Heisenberg to use the virtual oscillator model to try to calculate spectral frequencies. The method proved too difficult to immediately apply to realistic problems, so Heisenberg turned to a simpler example, the anharmonic oscillator. The dipole oscillator consists of a simple harmonic oscillator, which is thought of as a charged particle on a spring, perturbed by an external force, like an external charge. The motion of the oscillating charge can be expressed as a Fourier series in the frequency of the oscillator. Heisenberg solved for the quantum behavior by two different methods. First, he treated the system with the virtual oscillator method, calculating the transitions between the levels that would be produced by the external source. He then solved the same problem by treating the anharmonic potential term as a perturbation to the harmonic oscillator and using the perturbation methods that he and Born had developed. Both methods led to the same results for the first and the very complicated second order correction terms. This suggested that behind the very complicated calculations lay a consistent scheme. So Heisenberg set out to formulate these results without any explicit dependence on the virtual oscillator model. To do this, he replaced the Fourier expansions for the spatial coordinates by matrices, matrices which corresponded to the transition coefficients in the virtual oscillator method. He justified this replacement by an appeal to Bohr’s correspondence principle and the Pauli doctrine that quantum mechanics must be limited to observables. On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born this paper to review and submit for publication. When Born read the paper, he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes at Breslau University. Born, with the help of his assistant and former student Pascual Jordan, began immediately to make the transcription and extension, and they submitted their results for publication; the paper was received for publication just 60 days after Heisenberg's paper. A follow-on paper was submitted for publication before the end of the year by all three authors. Up until this time, matrices were seldom used by physicists; they were considered to belong to the realm of pure mathematics. Gustav Mie had used them in a paper on electrodynamics in 1912 and Born had used them in his work on the lattice theory of crystals in 1921. While matrices were used in these cases, the algebra of matrices with their multiplication did not enter the picture as they did in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. In 1928, Albert Einstein nominated Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan for the Nobel Prize in Physics, but it was not to be. The announcement of the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 was delayed until November 1933. It was at that time that it was announced Heisenberg had won the Prize for 1932 \"for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, inter alia, led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen\".\nOn 1 April 1935, the eminent theoretical physicist Arnold Sommerfeld, Heisenberg's doctoral advisor at the University of Munich, achieved emeritus status. However, Sommerfeld stayed in his chair during the selection process for his successor, which took until 1 December 1939. The process was lengthy due to academic and political differences between the Munich Faculty's selection and that of the Reichserziehungsministerium (REM, Reich Education Ministry) and the supporters of Deutsche Physik, which was anti-Semitic and had a bias against theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity. In 1935, the Munich Faculty drew up a list of candidates to replace Sommerfeld as ordinarius professor of theoretical physics and head of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Munich. There were three names on the list: Werner Heisenberg, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932, Peter Debye, who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1936, and Richard Becker – all former students of Sommerfeld. The Munich Faculty was firmly behind these candidates, with Heisenberg as their first choice. However, supporters of Deutsche Physik and elements in the REM had their own list of candidates, and the battle dragged on for over four years. During this time, Heisenberg came under vicious attack by the Deutsche Physik supporters. One attack was published in Das Schwarze Korps, the newspaper of the Schutzstaffel, headed by Heinrich Himmler. In this, Heisenberg was called a \"White Jew\" (i.e. an Aryan who acts like a Jew) who should be made to \"disappear\". These attacks were taken seriously, as Jews were violently attacked and incarcerated. Heisenberg fought back with an editorial and a letter to Himmler, in an attempt to resolve this matter and regain his honour. At one point, Heisenberg's mother visited Himmler's mother. The two women knew each other, as Heisenberg's maternal grandfather and Himmler's father were rectors and members of a Bavarian hiking club. Eventually, Himmler settled the Heisenberg affair by sending two letters, one to SS Gruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich and one to Heisenberg, both on 21 July 1938. In the letter to Heydrich, Himmler said Germany could not afford to lose or silence Heisenberg, as he would be useful for teaching a generation of scientists. To Heisenberg, Himmler said the letter came on recommendation of his family and he cautioned Heisenberg to make a distinction between professional physics research results and the personal and political attitudes of the involved scientists. The letter to Heisenberg was signed under the closing \"Mit freundlichem Gruß und, Heil Hitler!\" (With friendly greetings, Heil Hitler!\") Overall, the Heisenberg affair was a victory for academic standards and professionalism. However, the appointment of Wilhelm Müller to replace Sommerfeld was a political victory over academic standards. Müller was not a theoretical physicist, had not published in a physics journal, and was not a member of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft; his appointment was considered a travesty and detrimental to educating theoretical physicists.

Heisenberg had participated in the doctoral examination of one of them at the Universität Leipzig. The most influential of the three was Johannes Juilfs. During their investigation, they had become supporters of Heisenberg as well as his position against the ideological policies of the Deutsche Physik movement in theoretical physics and academia.\nIn 1939, shortly after the discovery of nuclear fission, the German nuclear weapon project, also known as the Uranverein (Uranium Club), had begun. Heisenberg was one of the principal scientists leading research and development in the project. From 15 to 22 September 1941, Heisenberg travelled to German-occupied Copenhagen to lecture and discuss nuclear research and theoretical physics with Niels Bohr. On 26 February 1942, Heisenberg presented a lecture to Reich officials on energy acquisition from nuclear fission, after the army withdrew most of its funding. The Uranium Club was transferred to the Reich Research Council in July 1942. On 4 June 1942, Heisenberg was summoned to report to Albert Speer, Germany's Minister of Armaments, on the prospects for converting the Uranium Club's research toward developing nuclear weapons. During the meeting, Heisenberg told Speer that a bomb could not be built before 1945, and would require significant monetary and manpower resources. Five days later, on 9 June 1942, Adolf Hitler issued a decree for the reorganization of the RFR as a separate legal entity under the Reich Ministry for Armament and Ammunition; the decree appointed Reich Marshall Hermann Göring as the president. In September 1942, Heisenberg submitted his first paper of a three-part series on the scattering matrix, or S-matrix, in elementary particle physics. The first two papers were published in 1943 and the third in 1944. The S-matrix described only the states of incident particles in a collision process, the states of those emerging from the collision, and stable bound states; there would be no reference to the intervening states. This was the same precedent as he followed in 1925 in what turned out to be the foundation of the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics through only the use of observables. In February 1943, Heisenberg was appointed to the Chair for Theoretical Physics at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität (today, the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin). In April, his election to the Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften (Prussian Academy of Sciences) was approved. That same month, he moved his family to their retreat in Urfeld as Allied bombing increased in Berlin. In the summer, he dispatched the first of his staff at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik to Hechingen and its neighboring town of Haigerloch, on the edge of the Black Forest, for the same reasons. From 18–26 October, he travelled to German-occupied Netherlands. In December 1943, Heisenberg visited German-occupied Poland. From 24 January to 4 February 1944, Heisenberg travelled to occupied Copenhagen, after the German army confiscated Bohr's Institute of Theoretical Physics. He made a short return trip in April. In December, Heisenberg lectured in neutral Switzerland. The United States Office of Strategic Services sent former major league baseball catcher and OSS agent Moe Berg to attend the lecture carrying a pistol, with orders to shoot Heisenberg if his lecture indicated that Germany was close to completing an atomic bomb. Heisenberg did not give such an indication, so Berg decided not to shoot him, a decision Berg later described as his own \"uncertainty principle\". In January 1945, Heisenberg, with most of the rest of his staff, moved from the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik to the facilities in the Black Forest.\nIn December 1938, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann sent a manuscript to Naturwissenschaften reporting they had detected the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons and Otto Hahn concluded a bursting of the uranium nucleus; simultaneously, Hahn communicated these results to his friend Lise Meitner, who had in July of that year fled to the Netherlands and then went to Sweden. Meitner, and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, correctly interpreted Hahn's and Strassmann's results as being nuclear fission. The paper is dated 16 January 1939. Meitner is identified as being at the Physical Institute, Academy of Sciences, Stockholm. Frisch is identified as being at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, University of Copenhagen. Frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 January 1939. The paper is dated 17 January 1939. [The experiment for this letter to the editor was conducted on 13 January 1939; see Richard Rhodes The Making of the Atomic Bomb 263 and 268 (Simon and Schuster, 1986).] In 1944, Hahn received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the discovery of nuclear fission. Some historians have documented the history of the discovery of nuclear fission and believe Meitner should have been awarded the Nobel Prize with Hahn.

Paul Harteck was director of the physical chemistry department at the University of Hamburg and an advisor to the Heereswaffenamt (HWA, Army Ordnance Office). On 24 April 1939, along with his teaching assistant Wilhelm Groth, Harteck made contact with the Reichskriegsministerium (RKM, Reich Ministry of War) to alert them to the potential of military applications of nuclear chain reactions. Two days earlier, on 22 April 1939, after hearing a colloquium paper by Wilhelm Hanle on the use of uranium fission in a Uranmaschine (uranium machine, i.e., nuclear reactor), Georg Joos, along with Hanle, notified Wilhelm Dames, at the Reichserziehungsministerium (REM, Reich Ministry of Education), of potential military applications of nuclear energy. The communication was given to Abraham Esau, head of the physics section of the Reichsforschungsrat (RFR, Reich Research Council) at the REM. On 29 April, a group, organized by Esau, met at the REM to discuss the potential of a sustained nuclear chain reaction. The group included the physicists Walther Bothe, Robert Döpel, Hans Geiger, Wolfgang Gentner (probably sent by Walther Bothe), Wilhelm Hanle, Gerhard Hoffmann and Georg Joos; Peter Debye was invited, but he did not attend. After this, informal work began at the Georg-August University of Göttingen by Joos, Hanle and their colleague Reinhold Mannfopff; the group of physicists was known informally as the first Uranverein (Uranium Club) and formally as Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Kernphysik. The group's work was discontinued in August 1939, when the three were called to military training. The second Uranverein began after the Heereswaffenamt (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) squeezed the Reichsforschungsrat (RFR, Reich Research Council) out of the Reichserziehungsministerium (REM, Reich Ministry of Education) and started the formal German nuclear energy project under military auspices. The second Uranverein was formed on 1 September 1939, the day World War II began, and it had its first meeting on 16 September 1939. The meeting was organized by Kurt Diebner, advisor to the HWA, and held in Berlin. The invitees included Walther Bothe, Siegfried Flügge, Hans Geiger, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, Gerhard Hoffmann, Josef Mattauch and Georg Stetter. A second meeting was held soon thereafter and included Klaus Clusius, Robert Döpel, Werner Heisenberg and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. Also at this time, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, after World War II the Max Planck Institute for Physics), in Berlin-Dahlem, was placed under HWA authority, with Diebner as the administrative director, and the military control of the nuclear research commenced. When it was apparent that the nuclear energy project would not make a decisive contribution to ending the war effort in the near term, control of the KWIP was returned in January 1942 to its umbrella organization, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft (KWG, Kaiser Wilhelm Society, after World War II the Max-Planck Gesellschaft), and HWA control of the project was relinquished to the RFR in July 1942. The nuclear energy project thereafter maintained its kriegswichtig (important for the war) designation and funding continued from the military. However, the German nuclear power project was then broken down into the following main areas: uranium and heavy water production, uranium isotope separation and the Uranmaschine (uranium machine, i.e., nuclear reactor). Also, the project was then essentially split up between a number of institutes, where the directors dominated the research and set their own research agendas. The dominant personnel and facilities were the following: Heisenberg was appointed director-in-residence of the KWIP on 1 July 1942, as Peter Debye was still officially the director and on leave in the United States; Debye had gone on leave as he was a citizen of The Netherlands and had refused to become a German citizen when the HWA took administrative control of the KWIP. Heisenberg still also had his department of physics at the University of Leipzig where work was done for the Uranverein by Robert Döpel and his wife Klara Döpel. During the period Kurt Diebner administered the KWIP under the HWA program, considerable personal and professional animosity developed between Diebner and the Heisenberg inner circle – Heisenberg, Karl Wirtz, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. The point in 1942, when the army relinquished its control of the German nuclear energy project, was the zenith of the project relative to the number of personnel devoting time to the effort. There were only about 70 scientists working on the project, with about 40 devoting more than half their time to nuclear fission research. After this, the number of scientists working on applied nuclear fission diminished dramatically. Many of the scientists not working with the main institutes stopped working on nuclear fission and devoted their efforts to more pressing war related work. Over time, the HWA and then the RFR controlled the German nuclear energy project. The most influential people in the project were Kurt Diebner, Abraham Esau, Walther Gerlach and Erich Schumann. Schumann was one of the most powerful and influential physicists in Germany. Schumann was director of the Physics Department II at the Frederick William University (later, University of Berlin), which was commissioned and funded by the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH, Army High Command) to conduct physics research projects. He was also head of the research department of the HWA, assistant secretary of the Science Department of the OKH and Bevollmächtiger (plenipotentiary) for high explosives. Diebner, throughout the life of the nuclear energy project, had more control over nuclear fission research than did Walther Bothe, Klaus Clusius, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck or Werner Heisenberg.\nAlsos Mission was an Allied effort commanded by the Russian-American Colonel Boris T. Pash. He reported directly to General Leslie Groves, commander of the Manhattan Engineer District, which was developing atomic weapons for the United States. The chief scientific advisor to Alsos Mission was the physicist Samuel Goudsmit. Goudsmit was selected for this task because he had physics knowledge, he spoke German, and he personally knew a number of the German scientists working on the German nuclear energy project. He also knew little of the Manhattan Project, so, if he were captured, he would have little intelligence value to the Germans. The objectives of the Alsos Mission were to determine if the Germans had an atomic bomb program and to exploit German atomic related facilities, intellectual materials, materiel resources, and scientific personnel for the benefit of the US. Personnel on this operation generally swept into areas which had just come under control of the Allied military forces, but sometimes they operated in areas still under control by German forces. Berlin had been a location of many German scientific research facilities. To limit casualties and loss of equipment, many of these facilities were dispersed to other locations in the latter years of the war. The Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics) had mostly been moved in 1943 and 1944 to Hechingen and its neighboring town of Haigerloch, on the edge of the Black Forest, which eventually became the French occupation zone. This move, some scheming, and a fast-moving American task force allowed them to take into custody a large number of German scientists associated with nuclear research. The only section of the institute which remained in Berlin was the low-temperature physics section, headed by Ludwig Bewilogua, who was in charge of the exponential uranium pile. Nine of the prominent German scientists who published reports in Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte as members of the Uranverein were picked up by Operation Alsos and incarcerated in England under Operation Epsilon: Erich Bagge, Kurt Diebner, Walther Gerlach, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, Werner Heisenberg, Horst Korsching, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker and Karl Wirtz. Also incarcerated was Max von Laue, although he had nothing to do with the nuclear energy project. Goudsmit, the chief scientific advisor to Operation Alsos, thought von Laue might be beneficial to the postwar rebuilding of Germany and would benefit from the high level contacts he would have in England. Heisenberg had been captured and arrested by Colonel Pash at Heisenberg's retreat in Urfeld, on 3 May 1945, in an alpine operation in territory still under control by German forces. He was taken to Heidelberg, where, on 5 May, he met Goudsmit for the first time since the Ann Arbor visit in 1939. Germany surrendered just two days later. Heisenberg did not see his family again for eight months. Heisenberg was moved across France and Belgium and flown to England on 3 July 1945. The 10 German scientists were held at Farm Hall in England. The facility had been a safe house of the British foreign intelligence MI6. During their detention, their conversations were recorded. Conversations thought to be of intelligence value were transcribed and translated into English. The transcripts were released in 1992. Bernstein has published an annotated version of the transcripts in his book ''Hitler's Uranium Club: The Secret Recordings at Farm Hall, along with an introduction to put them in perspective. A complete, unedited publication of the British version of the reports appeared as Operation Epsilon: The Farm Hall Transcripts, which was published in 1993 by the Institute of Physics in Bristol and by the University of California Press in the US. The Farm Hall transcripts reveal that Heisenberg, along with other physicists interned at Farm Hall including Otto Hahn and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, were glad the Allies had won World War II, but regretted failing to create an atomic bomb. Upon hearing that the Allies had succeeded in creating atomic bombs and had dropped them in Japan, the German scientists speculated how the bomb was made and discussed their own failure. Heisenberg mentioned some misconceptions regarding the construction of an atomic bomb, such as the critical mass necessary to trigger a nuclear reaction. The morality of creating a bomb for the Nazis was also discussed. Only a few of the scientists expressed genuine horror at the prospect of nuclear weapons, and Heisenberg himself was cautious in discussing the matter. In his book Alsos, Samuel Goudsmit states that the German scientists were willing to work for the Nazis to develop an atomic weapon, and attributed their failure to scientific misconception. Paul Lawrence Rose argues in Heisenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb Project: a Study in German Culture that Heisenberg is intentionally misleading in his report of the atomic bomb project in order to protect his own reputation.\nOn 3 January 1946, the 10 Operation Epsilon detainees were transported to Alswede in Germany, which was in the British occupation zone. Heisenberg settled in Göttingen, also in the British zone. In July, he was named director of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics), then located in Göttingen. Shortly thereafter, it was renamed the Max-Planck-Institut für Physik, in honor of Max Planck and to assuage political objections to the continuation of the institute. Heisenberg was its director until 1958. In 1958, the institute was moved to Munich, expanded, and renamed Max-Planck-Institut für Physik und Astrophysik . Heisenberg was its director from 1960 to 1970; in the interim, Heisenberg and the astrophysicist Ludwig Biermann were co-directors. Heisenberg resigned his directorship of the MPIFA on 31 December 1970. Upon the move to Munich, Heisenberg also became an ordentlicher Professor (ordinarius professor) at the University of Munich. Just as the Americans did with Operation Alsos, the Soviets inserted special search teams into Germany and Austria in the wake of their troops. Their objective, under the Russian Alsos, was also the exploitation of German atomic related facilities, intellectual materials, materiel resources and scientific personnel for the benefit of the Soviet Union. One of the German scientists recruited under this Soviet operation was the nuclear physicist Heinz Pose, who was made head of Laboratory V in Obninsk. When he returned to Germany on a recruiting trip for his laboratory, Pose wrote a letter to Werner Heisenberg inviting him to work in the USSR. The letter lauded the working conditions in the USSR and the available resources, as well as the favorable attitude of the Soviets towards German scientists. A courier hand delivered the recruitment letter, dated 18 July 1946, to Heisenberg; Heisenberg politely declined in a return letter to Pose. In 1947, Heisenberg presented lectures in Cambridge, Edinburgh and Bristol. Heisenberg also contributed to the understanding of the phenomenon of superconductivity with a paper in 1947 and two papers in 1948, one of them with Max von Laue. In the period shortly after World War II, Heisenberg briefly returned to the subject of his doctoral thesis, turbulence. Three papers were published in 1948 and one in 1950. In the post-war period, Heisenberg continued his interests in cosmic-ray showers with considerations on multiple production of mesons. He published three papers in 1949, two  in 1952, and one in 1955. On 9 March 1949, the Deutsche Forschungsrat (German Research Council) was established by the Max-Planck Gesellschaft (MPG, Max Planck Society, successor organization to the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft). Heisenberg was appointed president of the Deutsche Forschungsrat. In 1951, the organization was fused with the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft (NG, Emergency Association of German Science) and that same year renamed the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation). With the merger, Heisenberg was appointed to the presidium. In 1952, Heisenberg served as the chairman of the Commission for Atomic Physics of the DFG. Also that year, he headed the German delegation to the European Council for Nuclear Research . In 1953, Heisenberg was appointed president of the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung by Konrad Adenauer. Heisenberg served until 1975. Also, from 1953, Heisenberg's theoretical work concentrated on the unified field theory of elementary particles. In late 1955 to early 1956, Heisenberg gave the Gifford Lectures at St Andrews University, in Scotland, on the intellectual history of physics. The lectures were later published as Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science. During 1956 and 1957, Heisenberg was the chairman of the Arbeitskreis Kernphysik (Nuclear Physics Working Group) of the Fachkommission II \"Forschung und Nachwuchs\" (Commission II \"Research and Growth\") of the Deutschen Atomkommission (DAtK, German Atomic Energy Commission). Other members of the Nuclear Physics Working Group in both 1956 and 1957 were: Walther Bothe, Hans Kopfermann (vice-chairman), Fritz Bopp, Wolfgang Gentner, Otto Haxel, Willibald Jentschke, Heinz Maier-Leibnitz, Josef Mattauch, Wolfgang Riezler, Wilhelm Walcher and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. Wolfgang Paul was also a member of the group during 1957. In 1957, Heisenberg was a signatory of the manifesto of the Göttinger Achtzehn (Göttingen Eighteen). From 1957, Heisenberg was interested in plasma physics and the process of nuclear fusion. He also collaborated with the International Institute of Atomic Physics in Geneva. He was a member of the Institute's Scientific Policy Committee, and for several years was the Committee's chairman. In 1973, Heisenberg gave a lecture at Harvard University on the historical development of the concepts of quantum theory. On 24 March 1973, Heisenberg gave a speech before the Catholic Academy of Bavaria, accepting the Romano Guardini Prize. An English translation of its title is \"Scientific and Religious Truth. \" And its stated goal was \"In what follows, then, we shall first of all deal with the unassailability and value of scientific truth, and then with the much wider field of religion, of which – so far as the Christian religion is concerned – Guardini himself has so persuasively written; finally – and this will be the hardest part to formulate – we shall speak of the relationship of the two truths. \" A more detailed insight into Heisenberg's view on religion has been discussed by Wilfried Schröder in \"Natural science and religion\" (Bremen 1999, Science edition) and Wilfried Schröder \"Naturerkenntnis und Religion\" (Bremen, science edition 2008).\nIn January 1937 Heisenberg met Elisabeth Schumacher (1914–1998) at a private music recital. Elisabeth was the daughter of a well-known Berlin economics professor, and her brother was the economist E. F. Schumacher, author of Small Is Beautiful. Heisenberg married her on 29 April. Fraternal twins Maria and Wolfgang were born in January 1938, whereupon Wolfgang Pauli congratulated Heisenberg on his \"pair creation\" – a word play on a process from elementary particle physics, pair production. They had five more children over the next 12 years: Barbara, Christine, Jochen, Martin and Verena. Jochen became a physics professor at the University of New Hampshire. Heisenberg enjoyed classical music and was an accomplished pianist. Heisenberg was raised and lived as a Lutheran Christian, publishing and giving several talks reconciling science with his faith. In his speech Scientific and Religious Truth while accepting the Romano Guardini Prize, Heisenberg affirmed: \"In the history of science, ever since the famous trial of Galileo, it has repeatedly been claimed that scientific truth cannot be reconciled with the religious interpretation of the world. Although I am now convinced that scientific truth is unassailable in its own field, I have never found it possible to dismiss the content of religious thinking as simply part of an outmoded phase in the consciousness of mankind, a part we shall have to give up from now on. Thus in the course of my life I have repeatedly been compelled to ponder on the relationship of these two regions of thought, for I have never been able to doubt the reality of that to which they point. \" (Heisenberg 1974, 213)  \"Where no guiding ideals are left to point the way, the scale of values disappears and with it the meaning of our deeds and sufferings, and at the end can lie only negation and despair. Religion is therefore the foundation of ethics, and ethics the presupposition of life. \" (Heisenberg 1974, 219). In his autobiographical article in the journal Truth, Henry Margenau (Professor Emeritus of Physics and Natural Philosophy at Yale University) pointed out: \"I have said nothing about the years between 1936 and 1950. There were, however, a few experiences I cannot forget. One was my first meeting with Heisenberg, who came to America soon after the end of the Second World War. Our conversation was intimate and he impressed me by his deep religious conviction. He was a true Christian in every sense of that word. Heisenberg also enjoyed mountaineering. In his autobiography, he included photographs from this activity. Heisenberg died of cancer of the kidneys and gall bladder at his home, on 1 February 1976. The next evening, his colleagues and friends walked in remembrance from the Institute of Physics to his home and each put a candle near the front door. He is buried at Munich Waldfriedhof.\nHeisenberg was awarded a number of honors:\nThe following reports were published in Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte (Research Reports in Nuclear Physics), an internal publication of the German Uranverein. The reports were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied Operation Alsos and sent to the United States Atomic Energy Commission for evaluation. In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center and the American Institute of Physics.\n\n","So long ago, certain place, certain time, you touched my hand.\nAll the way down to Emmiline, but if our paths never cross, well you know I'm sorry but if I live to see the seven wonders, I'll make a path to the rainbow's end.\nI'll never live to match the beauty again, the rainbow's end.\n\nSo it's hard to find someone with that kind of intensity.\nYou touched my hand I played it cool.\n\nSo long ago, it's a certain time, it's a certain place.\nYou touched my hand and you smiled all the way back you held out your hand.\nIf I hope and I pray, ooh it might work out someday.\nIf I live to see the seven wonders, I'll make a path to the rainbow's end.\nI'll never live to match the beauty again.\n\n","THE King’s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.\nHe had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.\nShe was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a\nsledge drawn by six reindeer.  The sledge was shaped like a great golden\nswan, and between the swan’s wings lay the little Princess herself.  Her\nlong ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny\ncap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she\nhad always lived.  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets\nall the people wondered.  “She is like a white rose!” they cried, and\nthey threw down flowers on her from the balconies.\n\nAt the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had\ndreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he\nsank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.\n\n“Your picture was beautiful,” he murmured, “but you are more beautiful\nthan your picture”; and the little Princess blushed.\n\n“She was like a white rose before,” said a young Page to his neighbour,\n“but she is like a red rose now”; and the whole Court was delighted.\n\nFor the next three days everybody went about saying, “White rose, Red\nrose, Red rose, White rose”; and the King gave orders that the Page’s\nsalary was to be doubled.  As he received no salary at all this was not\nof much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly\npublished in the Court Gazette.\n\nWhen the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  It was a\nmagnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand\nunder a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.  Then\nthere was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and\nPrincess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear\ncrystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips\ntouched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.\n\n“It’s quite clear that they love each other,” said the little Page, “as\nclear as crystal!” and the King doubled his salary a second time.  “What\nan honour!” cried all the courtiers.\n\nAfter the banquet there was to be a Ball.  The bride and bridegroom were\nto dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the\nflute.  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so,\nbecause he was the King.  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never\nquite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for,\nwhatever he did, everybody cried out, “Charming! charming!”\n\nThe last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be\nlet off exactly at midnight.  The little Princess had never seen a\nfirework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal\nPyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.\n\n“What are fireworks like?” she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she\nwas walking on the terrace.\n\n“They are like the Aurora Borealis,” said the King, who always answered\nquestions that were addressed to other people, “only much more natural.\nI prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to\nappear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.  You must\ncertainly see them.”\n\nSo at the end of the King’s garden a great stand had been set up, and as\nsoon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place,\nthe fireworks began to talk to each other.\n\n“The world is certainly very beautiful,” cried a little Squib.  “Just\nlook at those yellow tulips.  Why! if they were real crackers they could\nnot be lovelier.  I am very glad I have travelled.  Travel improves the\nmind wonderfully, and does away with all one’s prejudices.”\n\n“The King’s garden is not the world, you foolish squib,” said a big Roman\nCandle; “the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days\nto see it thoroughly.”\n\n“Any place you love is the world to you,” exclaimed a pensive Catherine\nWheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided\nherself on her broken heart; “but love is not fashionable any more, the\npoets have killed it.  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed\nthem, and I am not surprised.  True love suffers, and is silent.  I\nremember myself once—But it is no matter now.  Romance is a thing of the\npast.”\n\n“Nonsense!” said the Roman Candle, “Romance never dies.  It is like the\nmoon, and lives for ever.  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love\neach other very dearly.  I heard all about them this morning from a\nbrown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as\nmyself, and knew the latest Court news.”\n\nBut the Catherine Wheel shook her head.  “Romance is dead, Romance is\ndead, Romance is dead,” she murmured.  She was one of those people who\nthink that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times,\nit becomes true in the end.\n\nSuddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.\n\nIt came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end\nof a long stick.  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as\nto attract attention.\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine\nWheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, “Romance is dead.”\n\n“Order! order!” cried out a Cracker.  He was something of a politician,\nand had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew\nthe proper Parliamentary expressions to use.\n\n“Quite dead,” whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.\n\nAs soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and\nbegan.  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating\nhis memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he\nwas talking.  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.\n\n“How fortunate it is for the King’s son,” he remarked, “that he is to be\nmarried on the very day on which I am to be let off.  Really, if it had\nbeen arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him;\nbut, Princes are always lucky.”\n\n“Dear me!” said the little Squib, “I thought it was quite the other way,\nand that we were to be let off in the Prince’s honour.”\n\n“It may be so with you,” he answered; “indeed, I have no doubt that it\nis, but with me it is different.  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come\nof remarkable parents.  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel\nof her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.  When she made her\ngreat public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went\nout, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink\nstars.  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very\nbest gunpowder.  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French\nextraction.  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would\nnever come down again.  He did, though, for he was of a kindly\ndisposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden\nrain.  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering\nterms.  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic\nart.”\n\n“Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,” said a Bengal Light; “I know it is\nPyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.”\n\n“Well, I said Pylotechnic,” answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of\nvoice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to\nbully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of\nsome importance.\n\n“I was saying,” continued the Rocket, “I was saying—What was I saying?”\n\n“You were talking about yourself,” replied the Roman Candle.\n\n“Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was\nso rudely interrupted.  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind,\nfor I am extremely sensitive.  No one in the whole world is so sensitive\nas I am, I am quite sure of that.”\n\n“What is a sensitive person?” said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.\n\n“A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other\npeople’s toes,” answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the\nCracker nearly exploded with laughter.\n\n“Pray, what are you laughing at?” inquired the Rocket; “I am not\nlaughing.”\n\n“I am laughing because I am happy,” replied the Cracker.\n\n“That is a very selfish reason,” said the Rocket angrily.  “What right\nhave you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others.  In fact, you\nshould be thinking about me.  I am always thinking about myself, and I\nexpect everybody else to do the same.  That is what is called sympathy.\nIt is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.  Suppose,\nfor instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that\nwould be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy\nagain, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I\nknow he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the\nimportance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.”\n\n“If you want to give pleasure to others,” cried the Roman Candle, “you\nhad better keep yourself dry.”\n\n“Certainly,” exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits;\n“that is only common sense.”\n\n“Common sense, indeed!” said the Rocket indignantly; “you forget that I\nam very uncommon, and very remarkable.  Why, anybody can have common\nsense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination,\nfor I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as\nbeing quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no\none here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for\nmyself, I don’t care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is\nthe consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this\nis a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any\nhearts.  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and\nPrincess had not just been married.”\n\n“Well, really,” exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, “why not?  It is a most\njoyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the\nstars all about it.  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about\nthe pretty bride.”\n\n“Ah! what a trivial view of life!” said the Rocket; “but it is only what\nI expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why,\nperhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there\nis a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little\nfair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps\nsome day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may\ngo to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall\ninto the deep river and be drowned.  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor\npeople, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall\nnever get over it.”\n\n“But they have not lost their only son,” said the Roman Candle; “no\nmisfortune has happened to them at all.”\n\n“I never said that they had,” replied the Rocket; “I said that they\nmight.  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying\nanything more about the matter.  I hate people who cry over spilt milk.\nBut when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very\nmuch affected.”\n\n“You certainly are!” cried the Bengal Light.  “In fact, you are the most\naffected person I ever met.”\n\n“You are the rudest person I ever met,” said the Rocket, “and you cannot\nunderstand my friendship for the Prince.”\n\n“Why, you don’t even know him,” growled the Roman Candle.\n\n“I never said I knew him,” answered the Rocket.  “I dare say that if I\nknew him I should not be his friend at all.  It is a very dangerous thing\nto know one’s friends.”\n\n“You had really better keep yourself dry,” said the Fire-balloon.  “That\nis the important thing.”\n\n“Very important for you, I have no doubt,” answered the Rocket, “but I\nshall weep if I choose”; and he actually burst into real tears, which\nflowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little\nbeetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were\nlooking for a nice dry spot to live in.\n\n“He must have a truly romantic nature,” said the Catherine Wheel, “for he\nweeps when there is nothing at all to weep about”; and she heaved a deep\nsigh, and thought about the deal box.\n\nBut the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept\nsaying, “Humbug! humbug!” at the top of their voices.  They were\nextremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called\nit humbug.\n\nThen the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to\nshine, and a sound of music came from the palace.\n\nThe Prince and Princess were leading the dance.  They danced so\nbeautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and\nwatched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.\n\nThen ten o’clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the\nlast stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King\nsent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.\n\n“Let the fireworks begin,” said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made\na low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.  He had six\nattendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a\nlong pole.\n\nIt was certainly a magnificent display.\n\nWhizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.\nBoom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the\nplace, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  “Good-bye,”\ncried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.\nBang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves\nimmensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.\nHe was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best\nthing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it\nwas of no use.  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak,\nexcept with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers\nwith blossoms of fire.  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little\nPrincess laughed with pleasure.\n\n“I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,” said the\nRocket; “no doubt that is what it means,” and he looked more supercilious\nthan ever.\n\nThe next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.  “This is evidently\na deputation,” said the Rocket; “I will receive them with becoming\ndignity” so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if\nhe were thinking about some very important subject.  But they took no\nnotice of him at all till they were just going away.  Then one of them\ncaught sight of him.  “Hallo!” he cried, “what a bad rocket!” and he\nthrew him over the wall into the ditch.\n\n“BAD Rocket?  BAD Rocket?” he said, as he whirled through the air;\n“impossible!  GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.  BAD and GRAND\nsound very much the same, indeed they often are the same”; and he fell\ninto the mud.\n\n“It is not comfortable here,” he remarked, “but no doubt it is some\nfashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my\nhealth.  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require\nrest.”\n\nThen a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat,\nswam up to him.\n\n“A new arrival, I see!” said the Frog.  “Well, after all there is nothing\nlike mud.  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.  Do\nyou think it will be a wet afternoon?  I am sure I hope so, but the sky\nis quite blue and cloudless.  What a pity!”\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket, and he began to cough.\n\n“What a delightful voice you have!” cried the Frog.  “Really it is quite\nlike a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the\nworld.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck\npond close by the farmer’s house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.\nIt is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact,\nit was only yesterday that I heard the farmer’s wife say to her mother\nthat she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is\nmost gratifying to find oneself so popular.”\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket angrily.  He was very much annoyed that he\ncould not get a word in.\n\n“A delightful voice, certainly,” continued the Frog; “I hope you will\ncome over to the duck-pond.  I am off to look for my daughters.  I have\nsix beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He\nis a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off\nthem.  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I\nassure you.”\n\n“Conversation, indeed!” said the Rocket.  “You have talked the whole time\nyourself.  That is not conversation.”\n\n“Somebody must listen,” answered the Frog, “and I like to do all the\ntalking myself.  It saves time, and prevents arguments.”\n\n“But I like arguments,” said the Rocket.\n\n“I hope not,” said the Frog complacently.  “Arguments are extremely\nvulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.\nGood-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little\nFrog swam away.\n\n“You are a very irritating person,” said the Rocket, “and very ill-bred.\nI hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to\ntalk about oneself, as I do.  It is what I call selfishness, and\nselfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my\ntemperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.  In fact, you\nshould take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.\nNow that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I\nam going back to Court almost immediately.  I am a great favourite at\nCourt; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my\nhonour.  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a\nprovincial.”\n\n“There is no good talking to him,” said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on\nthe top of a large brown bulrush; “no good at all, for he has gone away.”\n\n“Well, that is his loss, not mine,” answered the Rocket.  “I am not going\nto stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.  I like\nhearing myself talk.  It is one of my greatest pleasures.  I often have\nlong conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I\ndon’t understand a single word of what I am saying.”\n\n“Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,” said the Dragon-fly;\nand he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.\n\n“How very silly of him not to stay here!” said the Rocket.  “I am sure\nthat he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.  However,\nI don’t care a bit.  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some\nday”; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.\n\nAfter some time a large White Duck swam up to him.  She had yellow legs,\nand webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her\nwaddle.\n\n“Quack, quack, quack,” she said.  “What a curious shape you are!  May I\nask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?”\n\n“It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,” answered\nthe Rocket, “otherwise you would know who I am.  However, I excuse your\nignorance.  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable\nas oneself.  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up\ninto the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain.”\n\n“I don’t think much of that,” said the Duck, “as I cannot see what use it\nis to any one.  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw\na cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that\nwould be something.”\n\n“My good creature,” cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, “I\nsee that you belong to the lower orders.  A person of my position is\nnever useful.  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than\nsufficient.  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least\nof all with such industries as you seem to recommend.  Indeed, I have\nalways been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who\nhave nothing whatever to do.”\n\n“Well, well,” said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and\nnever quarrelled with any one, “everybody has different tastes.  I hope,\nat any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here.”\n\n“Oh! dear no,” cried the Rocket.  “I am merely a visitor, a distinguished\nvisitor.  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.  There is\nneither society here, nor solitude.  In fact, it is essentially suburban.\nI shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make\na sensation in the world.”\n\n“I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,” remarked the Duck;\n“there are so many things that need reforming.  Indeed, I took the chair\nat a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning\neverything that we did not like.  However, they did not seem to have much\neffect.  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.”\n\n“I am made for public life,” said the Rocket, “and so are all my\nrelations, even the humblest of them.  Whenever we appear we excite great\nattention.  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will\nbe a magnificent sight.  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and\ndistracts one’s mind from higher things.”\n\n“Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are!” said the Duck; “and\nthat reminds me how hungry I feel”: and she swam away down the stream,\nsaying, “Quack, quack, quack.”\n\n“Come back! come back!” screamed the Rocket, “I have a great deal to say\nto you”; but the Duck paid no attention to him.  “I am glad that she has\ngone,” he said to himself, “she has a decidedly middle-class mind”; and\nhe sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the\nloneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came\nrunning down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots.\n\n“This must be the deputation,” said the Rocket, and he tried to look very\ndignified.\n\n“Hallo!” cried one of the boys, “look at this old stick!  I wonder how it\ncame here”; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.\n\n“OLD Stick!” said the Rocket, “impossible!  GOLD Stick, that is what he\nsaid.  Gold Stick is very complimentary.  In fact, he mistakes me for one\nof the Court dignitaries!”\n\n“Let us put it into the fire!” said the other boy, “it will help to boil\nthe kettle.”\n\nSo they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit\nthe fire.\n\n“This is magnificent,” cried the Rocket, “they are going to let me off in\nbroad day-light, so that every one can see me.”\n\n“We will go to sleep now,” they said, “and when we wake up the kettle\nwill be boiled”; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.\n\nThe Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.  At last,\nhowever, the fire caught him.\n\n“Now I am going off!” he cried, and he made himself very stiff and\nstraight.  “I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher\nthan the moon, much higher than the sun.  In fact, I shall go so high\nthat—”\n\nFizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.\n\n“Delightful!” he cried, “I shall go on like this for ever.  What a\nsuccess I am!”\n\nBut nobody saw him.\n\nThen he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.\n\n“Now I am going to explode,” he cried.  “I shall set the whole world on\nfire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for\na whole year.”  And he certainly did explode.  Bang! Bang! Bang! went the\ngunpowder.  There was no doubt about it.\n\nBut nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound\nasleep.\n\nThen all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the\nback of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.\n\n“Good heavens!” cried the Goose.  “It is going to rain sticks”; and she\nrushed into the water.\n\n“I knew I should create a great sensation,” gasped the Rocket, and he\nwent out.\n\n","Asked a girl what she wanted to be\nShe said baby, can't you see\nI want to be famous, a star on the screen\nBut you can do something in between\nBaby you can drive my car\nYes I'm gonna be a star\nBaby you can drive my car\nAnd maybe I'll love you\n\nI told a girl that my prospects were good\nAnd she said baby, it's understood\nWorking for peanuts is all very fine\nBut I can show you a better time\n\nBaby you can drive my car\nYes I'm gonna be a star\nBaby you can drive my car\nAnd maybe I'll love you\n\nI told a girl I can start right away\nAnd she said listen babe I got something to say\nI got no car and it's breaking my heart\nBut I've found a driver and that's a start\n\n","\nThis is my recollection of my first acid trip. It was done with my girlfriend who had never done it either. My experience with drugs consists of chemicals such as MDMA, MDA, MDE, Methamphetamine ' by accident, thinking the were Ecstasy pills, Ketamine, Dipenhydramine (Dramamine), Adderall, Vicadin and plants such as marijuana and mushrooms.\n\nSetting: My friend's apartment with no one home except my girlfriend and I, very trippy one floor apartment weird pictures on the walls and interesting color schemes. Outside the weather is awful, raining/snowing/sleeting and cold. The night before, well about 1 that morning we took about 250 mg of Ketamine each at a rave and sniffed Rush, so that might have been a factor in the upcoming trip. At around 12:30 pm we dropped 3 tabs each and waited.\n\nT+1 hour: Starting to feel odd, just straight out weird, a bit anxious, I can feel it in my stomach its really annoying, we're giggling about everything mocking the cats in the house, I don't even know why, it was just funny. We start seeing some visuals, things turning and spiraling and patterns emerging and such, nothing brilliant but hey it was entertaining, the nausea is subsiding a bit. All of a sudden my friend (whose house I was at) comes into the house crying, and I think 'oh shit, tell me this isn't just a perfectly clich' event to lead us onto a bad trip.'\n\nSo I go into the other room and that's when the fear starts coming, because we just started coming up fairly strong when my friend came in and I'm like damnet, so I started thinking of like all these terrible things associated with evil and death and it was just scary, and I was on the VERGE of freaking out when my girlfriend came in and comforted me, saying how she was okay and my friend had made her hot chocolate. So I calmed down a bit, my friend left and it was us 2 again in the house.\n\nT+2 hours: I'm starting to get reallly paranoid of my friends mom coming home, even though I knew for a fact she would not be home till about 6:30 and it was about 2 or 2:30. I kept trying to comprehend what was happening as nothing was real anymore, patterns emerged from every crevice of the room, the music was incredible but I just felt SO weird I couldn't take it. I was in a continual thought loop trying to figure out what was going on. I kept getting real scared and I just wanted it to end. My girlfriend calmed me down a bit, it took a while but she did. Making out is real weird, I got bizarre mental visions. I kept envisioning weird colors in my mind.\n\nT+2.5 hours: Now the ceiling is raining rainbows, though the ceiling is actually white, and occasionally I see bursts of butterflies or it would start raining roses down on us. I was getting antsy again as I didn't know what to do with myself, we were literally stuck in the house because we couldn't go outside. The reason we couldn't go outside is when we looked out the window the trees turned alive and multiplied their branches and were just terrifying.\n\nStaring at the water on the ground from the second story window, the water turned into multitudes of letters and formed words. I was looking at black crows go by and right after they went by, a good 100+ more crows flew by in different areas of the sky (obviously hallucinations). So overall outside was too scary, but we didn't know what to do. I couldn't escape my mind which was on sensory overload. If there was no music I would hear sounds possibly miles away as if they were right next to me, and what was worse was they echoed - LOUD. And then there were more and more and more noises to the point where I couldn't be in the room.\n\nT+3 hours: The acid was getting to me. I kept thinking that this wouldn't end and I'd be in a world that wasn't real forever, nothing was real anymore, the fan was alive, the walls were alive, the blankets were alive, the floor was alive. Patterns melted into each other, and then formed new ones, from those patterns came new ones. The tracers were unbelievable, I'd be able to swing my hands around and I could move the color/pattern scheme of one object right onto another object. If the wall was striped I could bring the stripes onto the floor.\n\nAs I walked into each room I began turning every light on in the apartment to make everything glow its own individual color. And it did, as I walked into the kitchen everything was green, we decided we were hungry but couldn't eat anything so I took out clementimes. The problem was they were green, so we thought they were bad. The problem was that we forgot that when oranges are green it just means there not totally ripe. Somehow we thought that it was like bread, which turns green (mold) when it's bad, so it took us a while to figure that out.\n\nT+4 hours: I am crazy. I am so far gone that I actually gave up. When my girlfriend was wondering the apartment, I decided to sit in this little tiny back room next to the refrigerator and wait it out. My girlfriend, being the persistent little girl she is came in and sat with me and basically talked me through it somehow. The irony is that I'm about 1000x more experienced than her but she managed to talk me into being happy. At one point I saw a train go by the window and my girlfriend saw a little girl standing in the middle of the room pointing towards a chandelier.\n\nAt this point the music started getting overwhelming, my music selection was shitty as I kind of just figured pink Floyd would be amazing, but in fact it was so bizarre it was actually scaring me so we vigorously searched through my friend's selection and found Good Charlotte. Yes - good charlotte, we put it in and it was so corny that it made me happy! So were tripping out on the floor in her living room as my girlfriend is peeling/feeding me oranges and listening to Good Charlotte. By the way, eating fruit you like is a must; it beats any munchies I've ever ingested.\n\nT+5 hours: At this point the mental part of the trip is diminishing, I have almost complete control of my mind which is wonderful because I'm totally not paranoid anymore and overall I'm just happy. But the great thing was, was the visuals were still increasing in intensity. The most beautiful patterns I've ever seen are appearing everywhere, everywhere I looked things were alive, and it was magnificent. On top of that, I was starting to melt from time to time. I would actually feel my fingers extending or growing or getting fat/thin and I'd see it as well. In fact I even showed my girlfriend how my fingers were stretching and she saw it as I saw it and as I felt it.\n\nI was also, as well, able to control the movement of certain things with certain body parts, for example as my hand grew and shrank and moved I could move the door in that same fashion. As with looking at ourselves and each other, when I looked at my girlfriend her head would grow and shrink, and her eyes would grow huge, as well as her feet, but the rest of her body shrunk. It was if we were in Sonic the Hedgehog or Mario - actually she looked like a hedgehog, or tails from Sonic. At one point I saw my girlfriend was doing something weird with her arm, she was like trying to grab something in the sleeve of her sweatshirt with her hand. I asked her what she was doing and she said that her hand was lonely and wanted to meet another body part.\n\nAt one point we were standing in the kitchen and I was saying how I was hungry and could go for a snickers bar. All of a sudden she's like 'Yeah! Jesse.' and that was it. I knew the rest of what she was going to say as one time Jesse gave us a snickers bar when we came home rolling and needed food bad, I knew the rest of what she was going to say because her memory actually transferred to me visually, I saw it happen in front of my eyes at that moment.\n\nT+6 hours: At this point the visuals are receding, but just barely, the thought process was still really weird/fun. We took up some recreational time by drawing; I drew on her as she drew on a piece of paper. It looks like a mushroom but upside down it's supposed to have facial features. This was my girlfriend's doing, creative eh?\n\nT+8 hours: Sexual activity is fun, and were just having fun, things are still visually interesting, many things still breathing and swirling and very fun too look at, many patterns are still manifesting the house. We're laughing about a lot of things again and my girlfriend was sticking her tongue out at some poster cos she thought he was mean. haha.\n\nT+9 hours we were still seeing visuals but my dad came and picked us up and brought my girlfriend home. When I came home I ate food, which was kinda icky, and talked to my girlfriend on the phone till 3 am - visuals were still here, I have some trippy shit in my room, lava lamps, electricity balls, etc. And they were making butterflies all over my ceiling.\n\nThe next morning I felt fairly fine, a bit brain dead. I wasn't too enthused to go to work for 6 hours, but managed to go and didn't do to bad. Currently, the next day at 7:30 pm I feel almost completely back to normal.\n\nOverall this was probably the most intense, but greatest more glorious experience of my entire life. I will definitely do it again, maybe next time in a better setting like outside in a park or in my room at night with my girlfriend of course, after all she did save my sanity.\n\n","THE King’s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.\nHe had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.\nShe was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a\nsledge drawn by six reindeer.  The sledge was shaped like a great golden\nswan, and between the swan’s wings lay the little Princess herself.  Her\nlong ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny\ncap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she\nhad always lived.  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets\nall the people wondered.  “She is like a white rose!” they cried, and\nthey threw down flowers on her from the balconies.\n\nAt the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had\ndreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he\nsank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.\n\n“Your picture was beautiful,” he murmured, “but you are more beautiful\nthan your picture”; and the little Princess blushed.\n\n“She was like a white rose before,” said a young Page to his neighbour,\n“but she is like a red rose now”; and the whole Court was delighted.\n\nFor the next three days everybody went about saying, “White rose, Red\nrose, Red rose, White rose”; and the King gave orders that the Page’s\nsalary was to be doubled.  As he received no salary at all this was not\nof much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly\npublished in the Court Gazette.\n\nWhen the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  It was a\nmagnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand\nunder a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.  Then\nthere was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and\nPrincess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear\ncrystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips\ntouched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.\n\n“It’s quite clear that they love each other,” said the little Page, “as\nclear as crystal!” and the King doubled his salary a second time.  “What\nan honour!” cried all the courtiers.\n\nAfter the banquet there was to be a Ball.  The bride and bridegroom were\nto dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the\nflute.  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so,\nbecause he was the King.  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never\nquite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for,\nwhatever he did, everybody cried out, “Charming! charming!”\n\nThe last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be\nlet off exactly at midnight.  The little Princess had never seen a\nfirework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal\nPyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.\n\n“What are fireworks like?” she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she\nwas walking on the terrace.\n\n“They are like the Aurora Borealis,” said the King, who always answered\nquestions that were addressed to other people, “only much more natural.\nI prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to\nappear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.  You must\ncertainly see them.”\n\nSo at the end of the King’s garden a great stand had been set up, and as\nsoon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place,\nthe fireworks began to talk to each other.\n\n“The world is certainly very beautiful,” cried a little Squib.  “Just\nlook at those yellow tulips.  Why! if they were real crackers they could\nnot be lovelier.  I am very glad I have travelled.  Travel improves the\nmind wonderfully, and does away with all one’s prejudices.”\n\n“The King’s garden is not the world, you foolish squib,” said a big Roman\nCandle; “the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days\nto see it thoroughly.”\n\n“Any place you love is the world to you,” exclaimed a pensive Catherine\nWheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided\nherself on her broken heart; “but love is not fashionable any more, the\npoets have killed it.  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed\nthem, and I am not surprised.  True love suffers, and is silent.  I\nremember myself once—But it is no matter now.  Romance is a thing of the\npast.”\n\n“Nonsense!” said the Roman Candle, “Romance never dies.  It is like the\nmoon, and lives for ever.  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love\neach other very dearly.  I heard all about them this morning from a\nbrown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as\nmyself, and knew the latest Court news.”\n\nBut the Catherine Wheel shook her head.  “Romance is dead, Romance is\ndead, Romance is dead,” she murmured.  She was one of those people who\nthink that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times,\nit becomes true in the end.\n\nSuddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.\n\nIt came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end\nof a long stick.  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as\nto attract attention.\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine\nWheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, “Romance is dead.”\n\n“Order! order!” cried out a Cracker.  He was something of a politician,\nand had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew\nthe proper Parliamentary expressions to use.\n\n“Quite dead,” whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.\n\nAs soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and\nbegan.  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating\nhis memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he\nwas talking.  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.\n\n“How fortunate it is for the King’s son,” he remarked, “that he is to be\nmarried on the very day on which I am to be let off.  Really, if it had\nbeen arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him;\nbut, Princes are always lucky.”\n\n“Dear me!” said the little Squib, “I thought it was quite the other way,\nand that we were to be let off in the Prince’s honour.”\n\n“It may be so with you,” he answered; “indeed, I have no doubt that it\nis, but with me it is different.  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come\nof remarkable parents.  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel\nof her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.  When she made her\ngreat public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went\nout, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink\nstars.  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very\nbest gunpowder.  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French\nextraction.  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would\nnever come down again.  He did, though, for he was of a kindly\ndisposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden\nrain.  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering\nterms.  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic\nart.”\n\n“Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,” said a Bengal Light; “I know it is\nPyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.”\n\n“Well, I said Pylotechnic,” answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of\nvoice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to\nbully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of\nsome importance.\n\n“I was saying,” continued the Rocket, “I was saying—What was I saying?”\n\n“You were talking about yourself,” replied the Roman Candle.\n\n“Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was\nso rudely interrupted.  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind,\nfor I am extremely sensitive.  No one in the whole world is so sensitive\nas I am, I am quite sure of that.”\n\n“What is a sensitive person?” said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.\n\n“A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other\npeople’s toes,” answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the\nCracker nearly exploded with laughter.\n\n“Pray, what are you laughing at?” inquired the Rocket; “I am not\nlaughing.”\n\n“I am laughing because I am happy,” replied the Cracker.\n\n“That is a very selfish reason,” said the Rocket angrily.  “What right\nhave you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others.  In fact, you\nshould be thinking about me.  I am always thinking about myself, and I\nexpect everybody else to do the same.  That is what is called sympathy.\nIt is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.  Suppose,\nfor instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that\nwould be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy\nagain, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I\nknow he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the\nimportance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.”\n\n“If you want to give pleasure to others,” cried the Roman Candle, “you\nhad better keep yourself dry.”\n\n“Certainly,” exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits;\n“that is only common sense.”\n\n“Common sense, indeed!” said the Rocket indignantly; “you forget that I\nam very uncommon, and very remarkable.  Why, anybody can have common\nsense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination,\nfor I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as\nbeing quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no\none here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for\nmyself, I don’t care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is\nthe consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this\nis a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any\nhearts.  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and\nPrincess had not just been married.”\n\n“Well, really,” exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, “why not?  It is a most\njoyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the\nstars all about it.  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about\nthe pretty bride.”\n\n“Ah! what a trivial view of life!” said the Rocket; “but it is only what\nI expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why,\nperhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there\nis a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little\nfair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps\nsome day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may\ngo to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall\ninto the deep river and be drowned.  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor\npeople, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall\nnever get over it.”\n\n“But they have not lost their only son,” said the Roman Candle; “no\nmisfortune has happened to them at all.”\n\n“I never said that they had,” replied the Rocket; “I said that they\nmight.  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying\nanything more about the matter.  I hate people who cry over spilt milk.\nBut when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very\nmuch affected.”\n\n“You certainly are!” cried the Bengal Light.  “In fact, you are the most\naffected person I ever met.”\n\n“You are the rudest person I ever met,” said the Rocket, “and you cannot\nunderstand my friendship for the Prince.”\n\n“Why, you don’t even know him,” growled the Roman Candle.\n\n“I never said I knew him,” answered the Rocket.  “I dare say that if I\nknew him I should not be his friend at all.  It is a very dangerous thing\nto know one’s friends.”\n\n“You had really better keep yourself dry,” said the Fire-balloon.  “That\nis the important thing.”\n\n“Very important for you, I have no doubt,” answered the Rocket, “but I\nshall weep if I choose”; and he actually burst into real tears, which\nflowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little\nbeetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were\nlooking for a nice dry spot to live in.\n\n“He must have a truly romantic nature,” said the Catherine Wheel, “for he\nweeps when there is nothing at all to weep about”; and she heaved a deep\nsigh, and thought about the deal box.\n\nBut the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept\nsaying, “Humbug! humbug!” at the top of their voices.  They were\nextremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called\nit humbug.\n\nThen the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to\nshine, and a sound of music came from the palace.\n\nThe Prince and Princess were leading the dance.  They danced so\nbeautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and\nwatched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.\n\nThen ten o’clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the\nlast stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King\nsent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.\n\n“Let the fireworks begin,” said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made\na low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.  He had six\nattendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a\nlong pole.\n\nIt was certainly a magnificent display.\n\nWhizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.\nBoom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the\nplace, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  “Good-bye,”\ncried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.\nBang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves\nimmensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.\nHe was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best\nthing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it\nwas of no use.  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak,\nexcept with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers\nwith blossoms of fire.  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little\nPrincess laughed with pleasure.\n\n“I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,” said the\nRocket; “no doubt that is what it means,” and he looked more supercilious\nthan ever.\n\nThe next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.  “This is evidently\na deputation,” said the Rocket; “I will receive them with becoming\ndignity” so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if\nhe were thinking about some very important subject.  But they took no\nnotice of him at all till they were just going away.  Then one of them\ncaught sight of him.  “Hallo!” he cried, “what a bad rocket!” and he\nthrew him over the wall into the ditch.\n\n“BAD Rocket?  BAD Rocket?” he said, as he whirled through the air;\n“impossible!  GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.  BAD and GRAND\nsound very much the same, indeed they often are the same”; and he fell\ninto the mud.\n\n“It is not comfortable here,” he remarked, “but no doubt it is some\nfashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my\nhealth.  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require\nrest.”\n\nThen a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat,\nswam up to him.\n\n“A new arrival, I see!” said the Frog.  “Well, after all there is nothing\nlike mud.  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.  Do\nyou think it will be a wet afternoon?  I am sure I hope so, but the sky\nis quite blue and cloudless.  What a pity!”\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket, and he began to cough.\n\n“What a delightful voice you have!” cried the Frog.  “Really it is quite\nlike a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the\nworld.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck\npond close by the farmer’s house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.\nIt is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact,\nit was only yesterday that I heard the farmer’s wife say to her mother\nthat she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is\nmost gratifying to find oneself so popular.”\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket angrily.  He was very much annoyed that he\ncould not get a word in.\n\n“A delightful voice, certainly,” continued the Frog; “I hope you will\ncome over to the duck-pond.  I am off to look for my daughters.  I have\nsix beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He\nis a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off\nthem.  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I\nassure you.”\n\n“Conversation, indeed!” said the Rocket.  “You have talked the whole time\nyourself.  That is not conversation.”\n\n“Somebody must listen,” answered the Frog, “and I like to do all the\ntalking myself.  It saves time, and prevents arguments.”\n\n“But I like arguments,” said the Rocket.\n\n“I hope not,” said the Frog complacently.  “Arguments are extremely\nvulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.\nGood-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little\nFrog swam away.\n\n“You are a very irritating person,” said the Rocket, “and very ill-bred.\nI hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to\ntalk about oneself, as I do.  It is what I call selfishness, and\nselfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my\ntemperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.  In fact, you\nshould take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.\nNow that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I\nam going back to Court almost immediately.  I am a great favourite at\nCourt; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my\nhonour.  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a\nprovincial.”\n\n“There is no good talking to him,” said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on\nthe top of a large brown bulrush; “no good at all, for he has gone away.”\n\n“Well, that is his loss, not mine,” answered the Rocket.  “I am not going\nto stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.  I like\nhearing myself talk.  It is one of my greatest pleasures.  I often have\nlong conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I\ndon’t understand a single word of what I am saying.”\n\n“Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,” said the Dragon-fly;\nand he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.\n\n“How very silly of him not to stay here!” said the Rocket.  “I am sure\nthat he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.  However,\nI don’t care a bit.  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some\nday”; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.\n\nAfter some time a large White Duck swam up to him.  She had yellow legs,\nand webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her\nwaddle.\n\n“Quack, quack, quack,” she said.  “What a curious shape you are!  May I\nask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?”\n\n“It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,” answered\nthe Rocket, “otherwise you would know who I am.  However, I excuse your\nignorance.  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable\nas oneself.  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up\ninto the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain.”\n\n“I don’t think much of that,” said the Duck, “as I cannot see what use it\nis to any one.  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw\na cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that\nwould be something.”\n\n“My good creature,” cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, “I\nsee that you belong to the lower orders.  A person of my position is\nnever useful.  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than\nsufficient.  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least\nof all with such industries as you seem to recommend.  Indeed, I have\nalways been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who\nhave nothing whatever to do.”\n\n“Well, well,” said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and\nnever quarrelled with any one, “everybody has different tastes.  I hope,\nat any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here.”\n\n“Oh! dear no,” cried the Rocket.  “I am merely a visitor, a distinguished\nvisitor.  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.  There is\nneither society here, nor solitude.  In fact, it is essentially suburban.\nI shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make\na sensation in the world.”\n\n“I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,” remarked the Duck;\n“there are so many things that need reforming.  Indeed, I took the chair\nat a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning\neverything that we did not like.  However, they did not seem to have much\neffect.  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.”\n\n“I am made for public life,” said the Rocket, “and so are all my\nrelations, even the humblest of them.  Whenever we appear we excite great\nattention.  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will\nbe a magnificent sight.  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and\ndistracts one’s mind from higher things.”\n\n“Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are!” said the Duck; “and\nthat reminds me how hungry I feel”: and she swam away down the stream,\nsaying, “Quack, quack, quack.”\n\n“Come back! come back!” screamed the Rocket, “I have a great deal to say\nto you”; but the Duck paid no attention to him.  “I am glad that she has\ngone,” he said to himself, “she has a decidedly middle-class mind”; and\nhe sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the\nloneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came\nrunning down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots.\n\n“This must be the deputation,” said the Rocket, and he tried to look very\ndignified.\n\n“Hallo!” cried one of the boys, “look at this old stick!  I wonder how it\ncame here”; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.\n\n“OLD Stick!” said the Rocket, “impossible!  GOLD Stick, that is what he\nsaid.  Gold Stick is very complimentary.  In fact, he mistakes me for one\nof the Court dignitaries!”\n\n“Let us put it into the fire!” said the other boy, “it will help to boil\nthe kettle.”\n\nSo they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit\nthe fire.\n\n“This is magnificent,” cried the Rocket, “they are going to let me off in\nbroad day-light, so that every one can see me.”\n\n“We will go to sleep now,” they said, “and when we wake up the kettle\nwill be boiled”; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.\n\nThe Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.  At last,\nhowever, the fire caught him.\n\n“Now I am going off!” he cried, and he made himself very stiff and\nstraight.  “I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher\nthan the moon, much higher than the sun.  In fact, I shall go so high\nthat—”\n\nFizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.\n\n“Delightful!” he cried, “I shall go on like this for ever.  What a\nsuccess I am!”\n\nBut nobody saw him.\n\nThen he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.\n\n“Now I am going to explode,” he cried.  “I shall set the whole world on\nfire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for\na whole year.”  And he certainly did explode.  Bang! Bang! Bang! went the\ngunpowder.  There was no doubt about it.\n\nBut nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound\nasleep.\n\nThen all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the\nback of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.\n\n“Good heavens!” cried the Goose.  “It is going to rain sticks”; and she\nrushed into the water.\n\n“I knew I should create a great sensation,” gasped the Rocket, and he\nwent out.\n\n","Mahātmā Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (; ; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian activist who was the leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

In different South African towns (Pretoria, Cape Town, Bloemfontein, Johannesburg, and the Natal cities of Durban and Verulam), the struggle's martyrs were honoured and the Gandhi's bade farewell. Addresses in Durban and Verulam referred to Gandhi as a 'Mahatma', 'great soul'. He was seen as a great soul because he had taken up the poor's cause. The whites too said good things about Gandhi, who predicted a future for the Empire if it respected justice. \" (p. 172). —is now used worldwide. In India, he is also called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for father, papa<ref name=\"McAllister1982\"> Quote: \"With love, Yours, Bapu (You closed with the term of endearment used by your close friends, the term you used with all the movement leaders, roughly meaning 'Papa.'\" Another letter written in 1940 shows similar tenderness and caring. <ref name=\"Eck2003\"> Quote: \"... Born and raised in a Hindu merchant caste family in coastal Gujarat, western India, and trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, Gandhi first employed nonviolent civil disobedience as an expatriate lawyer in South Africa, in the resident Indian community's struggle for civil rights. After his return to India in 1915, he set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for various social causes and for achieving Swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi famously led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km Dandi Salt March in 1930, and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned for many years, upon many occasions, in both South Africa and India. He lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn hand-spun on a charkha. He ate simple vegetarian food, and also undertook long fasts as a means of both self-purification and political protest. Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism, however, was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India.<ref name=Khan2007-page1> Quote: \"the Muslim League had only caught on among South Asian Muslims during the Second World War. ... By the late 1940s, the League and the Congress had impressed in the British their own visions of a free future for Indian people. ... one, articulated by the Congress, rested on the idea of a united, plural India as a home for all Indians and the other, spelt out by the League, rested on the foundation of Muslim nationalism and the carving out of a separate Muslim homeland. \" (p. 18) Eventually, in August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan.<ref name=autogenerated3> Quote: \"South Asians learned that the British Indian empire would be partitioned on 3 June 1947. They heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and, later, through government pamphlets. Among a population of almost four hundred million, where the vast majority lived in the countryside, ..., it is hardly surprising that many ... did not hear the news for many weeks afterwards. For some, the butchery and forced relocation of the summer months of 1947 may have been the first they know about the creation of the two new states rising from the fragmentary and terminally weakened British empire in India. \" (p. 1) As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide solace. In the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to stop religious violence. The last of these, undertaken on 12 January 1948 when he was 78,<ref name=Brown1991-p380>Brown, p. 380: \"Despite and indeed because of his sense of helplessness Delhi was to be the scene of what he called his greatest fast. ... His decision was made suddenly, though after considerable thought – he gave no hint of it even to Nehru and Patel who were with him shortly before he announced his intention at a prayer-meeting on 12 January 1948. He said he would fast until communal peace was restored, real peace rather than the calm of a dead city imposed by police and troops. Patel and the government took the fast partly as condemnation of their decision to withhold a considerable cash sum still outstanding to Pakistan as a result of the allocation of undivided India's assets, because the hostilities that had broken out in Kashmir; ... But even when the government agreed to pay out the cash, Gandhi would not break his fast: that he would only do after a large number of important politicians and leaders of communal bodies agreed to a joint plan for restoration of normal life in the city. \" also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating. Among them was Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, who assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest.<ref name=\"CushRobinson2008\"> Quote: \"The apotheosis of this contrast is the assassination of Gandhi in 1948 by a militant Nathuram Godse, on the basis of his 'weak' accommodationist approach towards the new state of Pakistan. Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence.\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 to a Hindu Modh Baniya family in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the Indian Empire. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the diwan (chief minister) of Porbandar state. Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister. During his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family. Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade, a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860 – March 1914), a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960) and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913). On 2 October 1869, Putlibai gave birth to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city. As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as \"restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears. \" The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, he admits that they left an indelible impression on his mind. He writes: \"It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number. \" Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters. The family's religious background was eclectic. Gandhi's father Karamchand was Hindu and his mother Putlibai was from a Pranami Vaishnava Hindu family. Gandhi's father was of Modh Baniya caste in the varna of Vaishya. His mother came from the medieval Krishna bhakti-based Pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the Bhagavad Gita, the Bhagavata Purana, and a collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the Vedas, the Quran and the Bible. Gandhi was deeply influenced by his mother, an extremely pious lady who \"would not think of taking her meals without her daily prayers...she would take the hardest vows and keep them without flinching. To keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her. \" In 1874, Gandhi's father Karamchand left Porbandar for the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, the British regional political agency was located there, which gave the state's diwan a measure of security. In 1876, Karamchand became diwan of Rajkot and was succeeded as diwan of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. His family then rejoined him in Rajkot. At age 9, Gandhi entered the local school in Rajkot, near his home. There he studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language and geography. At age 11, he joined the High School in Rajkot. He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue tied student, with no interest in games; his only companions were books and school lessons. While at high school, Gandhi's elder brother introduced him to a Muslim friend named Sheikh Mehtab. Mehtab was older in age, taller and encouraged the strictly vegetarian boy to eat meat to gain height. He also took Mohandas to a brothel one day, though Mohandas \"was struck blind and dumb in this den of vice,\" rebuffed the prostitutes' advances and was promptly sent out of the brothel. The experience caused Mohandas mental anguish, and he abandoned the company of Mehtab. In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadia (her first name was usually shortened to \"Kasturba\", and affectionately to \"Ba\") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time. In the process, he lost a year at school, but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, \"As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives. \" However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband. Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, \"even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me. \" He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her. In late 1885, Gandhi's father Karamchand died. Gandhi, then 16 years old, and his wife of age 17 had their first baby, who survived only a few days. The two deaths anguished Gandhi. The Gandhi couple had four more children, all sons: Harilal, born in 1888; Manilal, born in 1892; Ramdas, born in 1897; and Devdas, born in 1900. In November 1887, the 18-year-old Gandhi graduated from high school in Ahmedabad. In January 1888, he enrolled at Samaldas College in Bhavnagar State, then the sole degree-granting institution of higher education in the region. But he dropped out and returned to his family in Porbandar.\nGandhi came from a poor family, and he had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal. His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing. On 10 August 1888, Gandhi aged 18, left Porbandar for Mumbai, then known as Bombay. Upon arrival, he stayed with the local Modh Bania community while waiting for the ship travel arrangements. The head of the community knew Gandhi's father. After learning Gandhi's plans, he and other elders warned Gandhi that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways. Gandhi informed them of his promise to his mother and her blessings. The local chief disregarded it, and excommunicated him an outcast. But Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London. His brother saw him off. In London, Gandhi studied law and jurisprudence and enrolled at the Inner Temple with the intention of becoming a barrister. His childhood shyness and self withdrawal had continued through his teens, and he remained so when he arrived in London, but he joined a public speaking practice group and overcame this handicap to practise law. His time in London was influenced by the vow he had made to his mother. He tried to adopt \"English\" customs, including taking dancing lessons. However, he could not appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by Henry Salt's writing, he joined the Vegetarian Society, was elected to its executive committee, and started a local Bayswater chapter. Some of the vegetarians he met were members of the Theosophical Society, which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of Buddhist and Hindu literature. They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the Bhagavad Gita both in translation as well as in the original. Gandhi, at age 22, was called to the bar in June 1891 and then left London for India, where he learned that his mother had died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from him. His attempts at establishing a law practice in Bombay failed because he was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses. He returned to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but he was forced to stop when he ran afoul of a British officer. In 1893, a Muslim merchant in Kathiawar named Dada Abdullah contacted Gandhi. Abdullah owned a large successful shipping business in South Africa. His distant cousin in Johannesburg needed a lawyer, and they preferred someone with Kathiawari heritage. Gandhi inquired about his pay for the work. They offered a total salary of £105 plus travel expenses. He accepted it, knowing that it would be at least one year commitment in the Colony of Natal, South Africa, also a part of the British Empire.\nIn April 1893, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin. He spent 21 years in South Africa, where he developed his political views, ethics and politics. Immediately upon arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination because of his skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning. When Gandhi arrived in South Africa, according to Herman, he thought of himself as \"a Briton first, and an Indian second\". However, the prejudice against him and his fellow Indians from British people that Gandhi experienced and observed deeply bothered him. He found it humiliating, struggling to understand how some people can feel honour or superiority or pleasure in such inhumane practices. Gandhi began to question his people's standing in the British Empire. The Abdullah case that had brought him to South Africa concluded in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi as he prepared to return to India. However, a new Natal government discriminatory proposal led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. He planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill. Though unable to halt the bill's passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the Natal Indian Congress in 1894, and through this organisation, he moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him and he escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. However, he refused to press charges against any member of the mob. During the Boer War, Gandhi volunteered in 1900 to form a group of stretcher-bearers as the Natal Indian Ambulance Corps. According to Arthur Herman, Gandhi wanted to disprove the imperial British stereotype that Hindus were not fit for \"manly\" activities involving danger and exertion, unlike the Muslim \"martial races\". Gandhi raised eleven hundred Indian volunteers, to support British combat troops against the Boers. They were trained and medically certified to serve on the front lines. They were auxiliaries at the Battle of Colenso to a White volunteer ambulance corps; then at Spion Kop Gandhi and his bearers moved to the front line and had to carry wounded soldiers for miles to a field hospital because the terrain was too rough for the ambulances. Gandhi and thirty-seven other Indians received the Queen's South Africa Medal. In 1906, the Transvaal government promulgated a new Act compelling registration of the colony's Indian and Chinese populations. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of Satyagraha (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, for the first time. According to Anthony Parel, Gandhi was also influenced by the Tamil text Tirukkuṛaḷ because Leo Tolstoy mentioned it in their correspondence that began with A Letter to a Hindu. Gandhi urged Indians to defy the new law and to suffer the punishments for doing so. Gandhi's ideas of protests, persuasion skills and public relations had emerged. He took these back to India in 1915.\nGandhi focused his attention on Indians while in South Africa. He was not interested in politics. This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, in some cases distressing to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a parasite, semi-barbarous, canker, squalid coolie, yellow man, and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate. While in South Africa, Gandhi focused on racial persecution of Indians, ignored those of Africans. In some cases, state Desai and Vahed, his behaviour was one of being a willing part of racial stereotyping and African exploitation. In a speech in September 1896 in India, for example, Gandhi complained the whites in British colony of South Africa were degrading Indian Hindus and Muslims to \"a level of Kaffir\". Scholars cite it as an example evidence that Gandhi at that time felt about Indians and black South Africans differently. As another example given by Herman, Gandhi, at age 24, prepared a legal brief for the Natal Assembly in 1895, seeking voting rights for Indians. Gandhi cited race history and European Orientalists' opinions that \"Anglo-Saxons and Indians are sprung from the same Aryan stock or rather the Indo-European peoples\", and argued that Indians should not be grouped with the Africans. Years later, Gandhi and his colleagues served and helped Africans as nurses and by opposing racism, according to the Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela. The general image of Gandhi, state Desai and Vahed, has been reinvented since his assassination as if he was always a saint, when in reality his life was more complex, contained inconvenient truths and was one that evolved over time. In contrast, other Africa scholars state the evidence points to a rich history of co-operation and efforts by Gandhi and Indian people with nonwhite South Africans against persecution of Africans and the Apartheid. In 1906, when the British declared war against the Zulu Kingdom in Natal, Gandhi at age 36, sympathised with the Zulus, and encouraged the Indian volunteers to help as an ambulance unit. He argued that Indians should participate in the war efforts to change attitudes and perceptions of the British people against the coloured people. Gandhi, a group of 20 Indians and black people of South Africa volunteered as a stretcher-bearer corps to treat wounded British soldiers and the opposite side of the war: Zulu victims. White soldiers stopped Gandhi and team from treating the injured Zulu, and some African stretcher-bearers with Gandhi were shot dead by the British. The medical team commanded by Gandhi operated for less than two months. Gandhi volunteering to help as a \"staunch loyalist\" during the Zulu and other wars made no difference in the British attitude, states Herman, and the African experience was a part of his great disillusionment with the West, transforming him into an \"uncompromising non-cooperator\". In 1910, Gandhi established an idealistic community called 'Tolstoy Farm' near Johannesburg, where he nurtured his policy of peaceful resistance. In the years after black South Africans gained the right to vote in South Africa, Gandhi was proclaimed a national hero with numerous monuments.\nAt the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to him by C. F. Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser. Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian. Gandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947 the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.\nIn April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi. Gandhi agreed to actively recruit Indians for the war effort. In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled \"Appeal for Enlistment\", Gandhi wrote \"To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them...If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army. \" He did, however, stipulate in a letter to the Viceroy's private secretary that he \"personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe. \" Gandhi's war recruitment campaign brought into question his consistency on nonviolence. Gandhi's private secretary noted that \"The question of the consistency between his creed of 'Ahimsa' (nonviolence) and his recruiting campaign was raised not only then but has been discussed ever since. \"\nGandhi's first major achievement came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were backed by the local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow Indigo, a cash crop whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.\nIn 1918, Kheda was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel. Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused but finally in end-May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.\nIn 1919, Gandhi then aged 49, after the World War I was over, sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the Ottoman Empire that had been defeated in the World War. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917–18. Gandhi had already supported the British crown with resources and by recruiting Indian soldiers to fight the war in Europe on the British side. This effort of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I. The British government, instead of self government, had offered minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi. Gandhi announced his satyagraha (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the Rowlatt Act, to block Gandhi's movement. The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for \"preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial\". Gandhi felt that Hindu-Muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the British. He leveraged the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (ummah). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the Sunni Islamic Caliph in Turkey. , Quote: \"Rabindranath Tagore heavily criticized Gandhi at the time in private letters . They reveal Tagore's belief that Gandhi had committed the Indian political nation to a cause that was mistakenly anti-Western and fundamentally negative\"; The increasing Muslim support for Gandhi, after he championed the Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt satyagraha demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi's stature as the political leader to the British. His support for the Khilafat movement also helped him sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced his opposition to the satyagraha non-cooperation movement approach of Gandhi. Jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan. By the end of 1922 the Khilafat movement had collapsed. Turkey's Ataturk had ended the Caliphate, Khilafat movement ended, and Muslim support for Gandhi largely evaporated. Muslim leaders and delegates abandoned Gandhi and his Congress. Hindu-Muslim communal conflicts reignited. Deadly religious riots re-appeared in numerous cities, with 91 in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh alone.\nWith his book Hind Swaraj Gandhi, aged 40, declared that British rule was established in India with the co-operation of Indians and had survived only because of this co-operation. If Indians refused to co-operate, British rule would collapse and swaraj would come. Mary Elizabeth King, \"Mohandas K, Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Bequest: Nonviolent Civil Resistance in a Globalized World\" in In February 1919, Gandhi cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable communication that if the British were to pass the Rowlatt Act, he will appeal Indians to start civil disobedience. The British government ignored him, passed the law stating it will not yield to threats. The satyagraha civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in satyagraha in Delhi. People rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, he asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but express their frustration with peace, to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing they own. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side uses violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. Government warned him to not enter Delhi. Gandhi defied the order. On 9 April, Gandhi was arrested. People rioted. On 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and a British officer named Reginald Dyer surrounded them and ordered his troops to fire on them. The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent, but was cheered by some Britons and parts of the British media as an appropriate response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using love to deal with the hate of the British government. Gandhi demanded that people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting. The massacre and Gandhi's non-violent response to it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott. The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi to the belief that Indians will never get a fair equal treatment under British rulers, and he shifted his attention to Swaraj or self rule and political independence for India. In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress. He reorganised the Congress. With Congress now behind him, and Muslim support triggered by his backing the Khilafat movement to restore the Caliph in Turkey, Gandhi had the political support and the attention of the British Raj. Gandhi expanded his nonviolent non-co-operation platform to include the swadeshi policy—the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that khadi (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning khadi in support of the independence movement. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively. The appeal of \"Non-cooperation\" grew, its social popularity drew participation from all strata of Indian society. Gandhi was arrested on 10 March 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He began his sentence on 18 March 1922. With Gandhi isolated in prison, the Indian National Congress split into two factions, one led by Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru favouring party participation in the legislatures, and the other led by Chakravarti Rajagopalachari and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, opposing this move. Furthermore, co-operation among Hindus and Muslims ended as Khilafat movement collapsed with the rise of Ataturk in Turkey. Muslim leaders left the Congress and began forming Muslim organisations. The political base behind Gandhi had broken into factions. Gandhi was released in February 1924 for an appendicitis operation, having served only two years.\nAfter his early release from prison for political crimes in 1924, over the second half of the 1920s, Gandhi continued to pursue swaraj. He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-co-operation with complete independence for the country as its goal. After his support for the World War I with Indian combat troops, and the failure of Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh questioned his values and non-violent approach. While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, Gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two. The British did not respond favourably to Gandhi's proposal. British political leaders such as Lord Birkenhead and Winston Churchill announced opposition to \"the appeasers of Gandhi\", in their discussions with European diplomats who sympathised with Indian demands. On 31 December 1929, the flag of India was unfurled in Lahore. Gandhi led Congress celebrated 26 January 1930 as India's Independence Day in Lahore. This day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organisation. Gandhi then launched a new Satyagraha against the tax on salt in March 1930. This was highlighted by the famous Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April, where he marched 388 km from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself. Thousands of Indians joined him on this march to the sea. This campaign was one of his most successful at upsetting British hold on India; Britain responded by imprisoning over 60,000 people. According to Sarma, Gandhi recruited women to participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield. When women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.\nAccording to Atlury Murali, Indian Congress in the 1920s appealed to Andhra Pradesh peasants by creating Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints. The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure. According to Dennis Dalton, it was the ideas that were responsible for his wide following. Gandhi criticised Western civilisation as one driven by \"brute force and immorality\", contrasting it with his categorisation of Indian civilisation as one driven by \"soul force and morality\". Gandhi captured the imagination of the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning \"hate with love\". These ideas are evidenced in his pamphlets from the 1890s, in South Africa, where too he was popular among the Indian indentured workers. After he returned to India, people flocked to him because he reflected their values. Gandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another. He used terminology and phrases such as Rama-rajya from Ramayana, Prahlada as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of swaraj and satyagraha. These ideas sounded strange outside India, during his lifetime, but they readily and deeply resonated with the culture and historic values of his people.\nThe government, represented by Lord Irwin, decided to negotiate with Gandhi. The Gandhi–Irwin Pact was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin's successor, Lord Willingdon, took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers. In Britain, Winston Churchill, a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister, became a vigorous and articulate critic of Gandhi and opponent of his long-term plans. Churchill often ridiculed Gandhi, saying in a widely reported 1931 speech: Churchill bitterness against Gandhi grew in the 1930s. He called Gandhi as the one who was \"seditious in aim\" whose evil genius and multiform menace was attacking the British empire. Churchill called him a dictator, a \"Hindu Mussolini\", fomenting a race war, trying to replace the Raj with Brahmin cronies, playing on the ignorance of Indian masses, all for selfish gain. Churchill attempted to isolate Gandhi, and his criticism of Gandhi was widely covered by European and American press. It gained Churchill sympathetic support, but it also increased support for Gandhi among Europeans. The developments heightened Churchill's anxiety that the \"British themselves would give up out of pacifism and misplaced conscience\".\nDuring the discussions between Gandhi and the British government over 1931–32 at the Round Table Conferences, Gandhi, now aged about 62, sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians. The British side sought reforms that would keep Indian subcontinent as a colony. The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions. The British questioned Congress party and Gandhi's authority to speak for all of India. They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as B. R. Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables. Gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because he feared that it would not bring people together but divide them, perpetuate their status and divert the attention from India's struggle to end the colonial rule. After Gandhi returned from Second Round Table conference, he started a new satyagraha. He was arrested and imprisoned at the Yerwada Jail, Pune. While he was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate. It came to be known as the Communal Award. In protest, Gandhi started fast-unto-death, while he was held in prison. The resulting public outcry forced the government, in consultations with Ambedkar, to replace the Communal Award with a compromise Poona Pact.\nIn 1934 Gandhi resigned from Congress party membership. He did not disagree with the party's position but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj. Gandhi returned to active politics again in 1936, with the Nehru presidency and the Lucknow session of the Congress. Although Gandhi wanted a total focus on the task of winning independence and not speculation about India's future, he did not restrain the Congress from adopting socialism as its goal. Gandhi had a clash with Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest. Despite Gandhi's opposition, Bose won a second term as Congress President, against Gandhi's nominee, Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya; but left the Congress when the All-India leaders resigned en masse in protest of his abandonment of the principles introduced by Gandhi. Gandhi declared that Sitaramayya's defeat was his defeat.\nGandhi opposed providing any help to the British war effort and he campaigned against any Indian participation in the World War II. Gandhi's campaign did not enjoy the support of Indian masses and many Indian leaders such as Sardar Patel and Rajendra Prasad. His campaign was a failure. Over 2.5 million Indians ignored Gandhi, volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of the allied forces. Gandhi opposition to the Indian participation in the World War II was motivated by his belief that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom while that freedom was denied to India itself. He also condemned Nazism and Fascism, a view which won endorsement of other Indian leaders. As the war progressed, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, calling for the British to Quit India in a 1942 speech in Mumbai. This was Gandhi's and the Congress Party's most definitive revolt aimed at securing the British exit from India. The British government responded quickly to the Quit India speech, and within hours after Gandhi's speech arrested Gandhi and all the members of the Congress Working Committee. His countrymen retaliated the arrests by damaging or burning down hundreds of government owned railway stations, police stations, and cutting down telegraph wires. In 1942, Gandhi now nearing age 73, urged his people to completely stop co-operating with the imperial government. In this effort, he urged that they neither kill nor injure British people, but be willing to suffer and die if violence is initiated by the British officials. He clarified that the movement would not be stopped because of any individual acts of violence, saying that the \"ordered anarchy\" of \"the present system of administration\" was \"worse than real anarchy. \" He urged Indians to Karo ya maro (\"Do or die\") in the cause of their rights and freedoms. Gandhi's arrest lasted two years, as he was held in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this period, his long time secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944; and Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack. While in Jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement. Gandhi was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 because of his failing health and necessary surgery; the Raj did not want him to die in prison and enrage the nation. He came out of detention to an altered political scene—the Muslim League for example, which a few years earlier had appeared marginal, \"now occupied the centre of the political stage\" and the topic of Muhammad Ali Jinnah's campaign for Pakistan was a major talking point. Gandhi and Jinnah had extensive correspondence in 1944, where Gandhi insisted on a united religiously plural India which included Muslims and non-Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. Jinnah rejected this proposal and insisted instead for partitioning the subcontinent on religious lines to create a separate Muslim India (later Pakistan). These discussions continued through 1947. While the leaders of Congress languished in jail, the other parties supported the war and gained organizational strength. Underground publications flailed at the ruthless suppression of Congress, but it had little control over events. At the end of the war, the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point Gandhi called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the Congress's leadership.\nGandhi opposed partition of the Indian subcontinent along religious lines. The Indian National Congress and Gandhi called for the British to Quit India. However, the Muslim League demanded \"Divide and Quit India\". Gandhi suggested an agreement which required the Congress and the Muslim League to co-operate and attain independence under a provisional government, thereafter, the question of partition could be resolved by a plebiscite in the districts with a Muslim majority. Jinnah rejected Gandhi's proposal and called for Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946, to press Muslims to publicly gather in cities and support his proposal for partition of Indian subcontinent into a Muslim state and non-Muslim state. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal – now Bangladesh and West Bengal, gave Calcutta's police special holiday to celebrate the Direct Action Day. The Direct Action Day triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict. The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence. The violence on Direct Action Day led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India. Thousands of Hindus and Muslims were murdered, and tens of thousands were injured in the cycle of violence in the days that followed. Gandhi visited the most riot-prone areas to appeal a stop to the massacres. Archibald Wavell, the Viceroy and Governor-General of British India for three years through February 1947, had worked with Gandhi and Jinnah to find a common ground, before and after accepting Indian independence in principle. Wavell condemned Gandhi's character and motives as well as his ideas. Wavell accused Gandhi of harbouring the single minded idea to \"overthrow British rule and influence and to establish a Hindu raj\", and called Gandhi a \"malignant, malevolent, exceedingly shrewd\" politician. Wavell feared a civil war on the Indian subcontinent, and doubted Gandhi would be able to stop it. The British reluctantly agreed to grant independence to the people of the Indian subcontinent, but accepted Jinnah's proposal of partitioning the land into Pakistan and India. Gandhi was involved in the final negotiations. Stanley Wolpert states the \"plan to carve up British India was never approved of or accepted by Gandhi\". The partition was controversial and violently disputed. More than half a million were killed in religious riots as 10–12 million non-Muslims (Hindus, Sikhs mostly) migrated from Pakistan into India, and Muslims migrated from India into Pakistan, across the newly created borders of India, West Pakistan and East Pakistan. Gandhi spent the day of independence not celebrating the end of the British rule, but appealing for peace among his countrymen by fasting and spinning in Calcutta on 15 August 1947. The partition had gripped the Indian subcontinent with religious violence and the streets were filled with corpses. Some writers credit Gandhi's fasting and protests stopped the religious riots and communal violence. Others do not. Archibald Wavell, for example, upon learning of Gandhi's assassination, commented, \"I always thought he [Gandhi] had more of malevolence than benevolence in him, but who am I to judge, and how can an Englishman estimate a Hindu? \"\nAt 5:17 pm on 30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his grandnieces in the garden of the former Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse fired three bullets from a Beretta M1934 9mm Corto pistol into his chest at point-blank range. According to some accounts, Gandhi died on the spot. In other accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom. There he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru addressed his countrymen over the All-India Radio saying: Friends and comrades, the light has gone out of our lives, and there is darkness everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country. Gandhi's assassin Godse made no attempt to escape and was seized by the witnesses. He was arrested. In the weeks that followed, his collaborators were arrested as well. Godse was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha. They were tried in court at Delhi's Red Fort. At his trial, Godse did not deny the charges nor express any remorse. According to Claude Markovits, a French historian noted for his studies of colonial India, Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacence towards Muslims, holding Gandhi responsible for the frenzy of violence and sufferings during the subcontinent's partition into Pakistan and India. Godse accused Gandhi of subjectivism and of acting as if only he had a monopoly of the truth. Godse was found guilty and executed in 1949. Gandhi's death was mourned nationwide. Over two million people joined the five-mile long funeral procession that took over five hours to reach Raj Ghat from Birla house, where he was assassinated. Gandhi's body was transported on a weapons carrier, whose chassis was dismantled overnight to allow a high-floor to be installed so that people could catch a glimpse of his body. The engine of the vehicle was not used; instead four drag-ropes manned by 50 people each pulled the vehicle. All Indian-owned establishments in London remained closed in mourning as thousands of people from all faiths and denominations and Indians from all over Britain converged at India House in London. Gandhi's assassination dramatically changed the political landscape. Nehru became his political heir. According to Markovits, while Gandhi was alive, Pakistan's declaration that it was a \"Muslim state\" had led Indian groups to demand that it be declared a \"Hindu state\". Nehru used Gandhi's martyrdom as a political weapon to silence all advocates of Hindu nationalism as well as his political challengers. He linked Gandhi's assassination to politics of hatred and ill-will. According to Guha, Nehru and his Congress colleagues called on Indians to honour Gandhi's memory and even more his ideals. Nehru used the assassination to consolidate the authority of the new Indian state. Gandhi's death helped marshal support for the new government and legitimise the Congress Party's control, leveraged by the massive outpouring of Hindu expressions of grief for a man who had inspired them for decades. The government suppressed the RSS, the Muslim National Guards, and the Khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests. For years after the assassination, states Markovits, \"Gandhi's shadow loomed large over the political life of the new Indian Republic\". The government quelled any opposition to its economic and social policies, despite they being contrary to Gandhi's ideas, by reconstructing Gandhi's image and ideals.\nGandhi was cremated per the Hindu tradition. Gandhi's ashes were poured into urns which were sent across India for memorial services. Most of the ashes were immersed at the Sangam at Allahabad on 12 February 1948, but some were secretly taken away. In 1997, Tushar Gandhi immersed the contents of one urn, found in a bank vault and reclaimed through the courts, at the Sangam at Allahabad. Some of Gandhi's ashes were scattered at the source of the Nile River near Jinja, Uganda, and a memorial plaque marks the event. On 30 January 2008, the contents of another urn were immersed at Girgaum Chowpatty. Another urn is at the palace of the Aga Khan in Pune (where Gandhi was held as a political prisoner from 1942 to 1944) and another in the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Los Angeles. The Birla House site where Gandhi was assassinated is now a memorial called Gandhi Smriti. The place near Yamuna river where he was cremated is the Rāj Ghāt memorial in New Delhi. A black marble platform, it bears the epigraph \"Hē Rāma\" (Devanagari: हे ! राम or, Hey Raam). These are widely believed to be Gandhi's last words after he was shot, though the veracity of this statement has been disputed.\nGandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him. Some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances. , Quote: \"Yet he [Gandhi] must bear some of the responsibility for losing his followers along the way. The sheer vagueness and contradictions recurrent throughout his writing made it easier to accept him as a saint than to fathom the challenge posed by his demanding beliefs. Gandhi saw no harm in self-contradictions: life was a series of experiments, and any principle might change if Truth so dictated\".\nGandhi grew up in a Hindu and Jain religious atmosphere in his native Gujarat which were his primary influences, but he was also influenced by his personal reflections and literature of Hindu Bhakti saints, Advaita Vedanta, Buddhism, Christianity and thinkers such as Tolstoy, Ruskin and Thoreau. He, at age 57, declared himself to be Advaitist Hindu in his religious persuasion, but added that he supported Dvaitist viewpoints and religious pluralism. Gandhi was influenced by his devout Vaishnava Hindu mother, the regional Hindu temples and saint tradition which co-existed with Jain tradition in Gujarat. Historian R.B. Cribb states that Gandhi's thought evolved over time, with his early ideas becoming the core or scaffolding for his mature philosophy. He committed himself early to truthfulness, temperance, chastity, and vegetarianism. Gandhi's London lifestyle incorporated the values he had grown up with. When he returned to India in 1891, his outlook was parochial and he could not make a living as a lawyer. This challenged his belief that practicality and morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found a solution to this problem and developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy. According to Bhikhu Parekh, three books that influenced Gandhi most in South Africa were William Salter's Ethical Religion ; Henry David Thoreau's On the Duty of Civil Disobedience (1849); and Leo Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God Is Within You (1894). Ruskin inspired his decision to live an austere life on a commune, at first on the Phoenix Farm in Natal and then on the Tolstoy Farm just outside Johannesburg, South Africa. The most profound influence on Gandhi were those from Hinduism, Christianity and Jainism, states Parekh, with his thoughts \"in harmony with the classical Indian traditions, specially the Advaita or monistic tradition\". According to Indira Carr and others, Gandhi was influenced by Vaishnavism, Jainism and Advaita Vedanta. Balkrishna Gokhale states that Gandhi was influenced by Hinduism and Jainism, and his studies of Sermon on the Mount of Christianity, Ruskin and Tolstoy. Additional theories of possible influences on Gandhi have been proposed. For example, in 1935, N. A. Toothi stated that Gandhi was influenced by the reforms and teachings of the Swaminarayan tradition of Hinduism. According to Raymond Williams, Toothi may have overlooked the influence of the Jain community, and adds close parallels do exist in programs of social reform in the Swaminarayan tradition and those of Gandhi, based on \"nonviolence, truth-telling, cleanliness, temperance and upliftment of the masses. \" Historian Howard states the culture of Gujarat influenced Gandhi and his methods.\nAlong with the book mentioned above, in 1908 Leo Tolstoy wrote A Letter to a Hindu, which said that only by using love as a weapon through passive resistance could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish A Letter to a Hindu in Gujarati. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy's death in 1910 (Tolstoy's last letter was to Gandhi). The letters concern practical and theological applications of nonviolence. Gandhi saw himself a disciple of Tolstoy, for they agreed regarding opposition to state authority and colonialism; both hated violence and preached non-resistance. However, they differed sharply on political strategy. Gandhi called for political involvement; he was a nationalist and was prepared to use nonviolent force. He was also willing to compromise. It was at Tolstoy Farm where Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach systematically trained their disciples in the philosophy of nonviolence.\nGandhi credited Shrimad Rajchandra, a poet and Jain philosopher, as his influential counsellor. In Modern Review, June 1930, Gandhi wrote about their first encounter in 1891 at Dr. P.J. Mehta's residence in Bombay. Gandhi exchanged letters with Rajchandra when he was in South Africa, referring to him as Kavi (literally, \"poet\"). In 1930, Gandhi wrote, \"Such was the man who captivated my heart in religious matters as no other man ever has till now. \" 'I have said elsewhere that in moulding my inner life Tolstoy and Ruskin vied with Kavi. But Kavi's influence was undoubtedly deeper if only because I had come in closest personal touch with him.' Gandhi, in his autobiography, called Rajchandra his \"guide and helper\" and his \"refuge… in moments of spiritual crisis\". He had advised Gandhi to be patient and to study Hinduism deeply.\nDuring his stay in South Africa, along with scriptures and philosophical texts of Hinduism and other Indian religions, Gandhi read translated texts of Christianity such as the Bible, and Islam such as the Quran. A Quaker mission in South Africa attempted to convert him to Christianity. Gandhi joined them in their prayers and debated Christian theology with them, but refused conversion stating he did not accept the theology therein or that Christ was the only son of God. His comparative studies of religions and interaction with scholars, led him to respect all religions as well as become concerned about imperfections in all of them and frequent misinterpretations. Gandhi grew fond of Hinduism, and referred to the Bhagavad Gita as his spiritual dictionary and greatest single influence on his life.\nGandhi participated in South African war against the Boers, on the British side in 1899. Both the Dutch settlers called Boers and the imperial British at that time discriminated against the coloured races they considered as inferior, and Gandhi later wrote about his conflicted beliefs during the Boer war. He stated that \"when the war was declared, my personal sympathies were all with the Boers, but my loyalty to the British rule drove me to participation with the British in that war\". According to Gandhi, he felt that since he was demanding his rights as a British citizen, it was also his duty to serve the British forces in the defence of the British Empire. During World War I (1914–1918), nearing the age of 50, Gandhi supported the British and its allied forces by recruiting Indians to join the British army, expanding the Indian contingent from about 100,000 to over 1.1 million. He encouraged his people to fight on one side of the war in Europe and Africa at the cost of their lives. Pacifists criticised and questioned Gandhi, who defended these practices by stating, according to Sankar Ghose, \"it would be madness for me to sever my connection with the society to which I belong\". According to Keith Robbins, the recruitment effort was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I. After the war, the British government offered minor reforms instead, which disappointed Gandhi. He launched his satyagraha movement in 1919. In parallel, Gandhi's fellowmen became sceptical of his pacifist ideas and were inspired by the ideas of nationalism and anti-imperialism. In a 1920 essay, after the World War I, Gandhi wrote, \"where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence. \" Rahul Sagar interprets Gandhi's efforts to recruit for the British military during the War, as Gandhi's belief that, at that time, it would demonstrate that Indians were willing to fight. Further, it would also show the British that his fellow Indians were \"their subjects by choice rather than out of cowardice. \" In 1922, Gandhi wrote that abstinence from violence is effective and true forgiveness only when one has the power to punish, not when one decides not to do anything because one is helpless. After World War II engulfed Britain, Gandhi actively campaigned to oppose any help to the British war effort and any Indian participation in the war. According to Arthur Herman, Gandhi believed that his campaign would strike a blow to imperialism. Gandhi's position was not supported by many Indian leaders, and his campaign against the British war effort was a failure. The Hindu leader, Tej Bahadur Sapru declared in 1941, states Herman, \"A good many Congress leaders are fed up with the barren program of the Mahatma\". Over 2.5 million Indians ignored Gandhi, volunteered and joined on the British side. They fought and died as a part of the allied forces in Europe, North Africa and various fronts of the World War II.\nGandhi dedicated his life to discovering and pursuing truth, or Satya, and called his movement as satyagraha, which means \"appeal to, insistence on, or reliance on the Truth\". The first formulation of the satyagraha as a political movement and principle occurred in 1920, which he tabled as \"Resolution on Non-cooperation\" in September that year before a session of the Indian Congress. It was the satyagraha formulation and step, states Dennis Dalton, that deeply resonated with beliefs and culture of his people, embedded him into the popular consciousness, transforming him quickly into Mahatma. Gandhi based Satyagraha on the Vedantic ideal of self-realization, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and universal love. William Borman states that the key to his satyagraha is rooted in the Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of these ideas are found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas. Gandhi's concept of satya as a civil movement, states Glyn Richards, are best understood in the context of the Hindu terminology of Dharma and Ṛta. Gandhi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own demons, fears, and insecurities. Gandhi summarised his beliefs first when he said \"God is Truth\". He would later change this statement to \"Truth is God\". Thus, satya (truth) in Gandhi's philosophy is \"God\". Gandhi, states Richards, described the term \"God\" not as a separate power, but as the Being (Brahman, Atman) of the Advaita Vedanta tradition, a nondual universal that pervades in all things, in each person and all life. According to Nicholas Gier, this to Gandhi meant the unity of God and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, that atman exists and is same as everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is the very nature of this atman. The essence of Satyagraha is \"soul force\" as a political means, refusing to use brute force against the oppressor, seeking to eliminate antagonisms between the oppressor and the oppressed, aiming to transform or \"purify\" the oppressor. It is not inaction but determined passive resistance and non-co-operation where, states Arthur Herman, \"love conquers hate\". A euphemism sometimes used for Satyagraha is that it is a \"silent force\" or a \"soul force\" (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech). It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. Satyagraha is also termed a \"universal force\", as it essentially \"makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe. \" Gandhi wrote: \"There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause. \" Civil disobedience and non-co-operation as practised under Satyagraha are based on the \"law of suffering\",<ref name=\"CollectedWorks20\"> a doctrine that the endurance of suffering is a means to an end. This end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, non-co-operation in Satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the co-operation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice. While Gandhi's idea of satyagraha as a political means attracted a widespread following among Indians, the support was not universal. For example, Muslim leaders such as Jinnah opposed the satyagraha idea, accused Gandhi to be reviving Hinduism through political activism, and began effort to counter Gandhi with Muslim nationalism and a demand for Muslim homeland. The untouchability leader Ambedkar, in June 1945, after his decision to convert to Buddhism and a key architect of the Constitution of modern India, dismissed Gandhi's ideas as loved by \"blind Hindu devotees\", primitive, influenced by spurious brew of Tolstoy and Ruskin, and \"there is always some simpleton to preach them\". ; B.R. Ambedkar, What Congress and Gandhi have done to the Untouchables, Thacker & Co. Editions, First Edition, pages v, 282–297 Winston Churchill caricatured Gandhi as a \"cunning huckster\" seeking selfish gain, an \"aspiring dictator\", and an \"atavistic spokesman of a pagan Hinduism\". Churchill stated that the civil disobedience movement spectacle of Gandhi only increased \"the danger to which white people there [British India] are exposed\".\nAlthough Gandhi was not the originator of the principle of nonviolence, he was the first to apply it in the political field on a large scale. The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has a long history in Indian religious thought, with it being considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought. Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth.<ref name=\"Borman1986\"> Cited from Gandhi was criticised for refusing to protest the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Udham Singh and Rajguru. He was accused of accepting a deal with the King's representative Irwin that released civil disobedience leaders from prison and accepted the death sentence against the highly popular revolutionary Bhagat Singh, who at his trial had replied, \"Revolution is the inalienable right of mankind\". Gandhi's views came under heavy criticism in Britain when it was under attack from Nazi Germany, and later when the Holocaust was revealed. He told the British people in 1940, \"I would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions... If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them. \" George Orwell remarked that Gandhi's methods confronted 'an old-fashioned and rather shaky despotism which treated him in a fairly chivalrous way', not a totalitarian Power, 'where political opponents simply disappear.' In a post-war interview in 1946, he said, \"Hitler killed five million Jews. It is the greatest crime of our time. But the Jews should have offered themselves to the butcher's knife. They should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs... It would have aroused the world and the people of Germany... As it is they succumbed anyway in their millions. \" Gandhi believed this act of \"collective suicide\", in response to the Holocaust, \"would have been heroism\".\nAccording to Kumaraswamy, Gandhi initially supported Arab demands with respect to Palestine. He justified this support by invoking Islam, stating that \"non-Muslims cannot acquire sovereign jurisdiction\" in Jazirat al-Arab (Arabian Peninsula). These arguments, states Kumaraswamy, were a part of his political strategy to win Muslim support during the Khilafat movement. In post-Khilafat period, Gandhi neither negated Jewish demands nor did he use Islamic texts or history to support Muslim claims against Israel. Gandhi's silence after the Khilafat period may represent an evolution in his understanding of the conflicting religious claims over Palestine, according to Kumaraswamy. In 1938, Gandhi spoke in favour of Jewish claims. In March 1946, he said to the Member of British Parliament Sidney Silverman, \"if the Arabs have a claim to Palestine, the Jews have a prior claim\", a position very different from his earlier stance. Gandhi discussed the persecution of the Jews in Germany and the emigration of Jews from Europe to Palestine through his lens of Satyagraha. In 1937, Gandhi discussed Zionism with his close Jewish friend Hermann Kallenbach. He said that Zionism was not the right answer to the problems faced by Jews and instead recommended Satyagraha. Gandhi thought the Zionists in Palestine represented European imperialism and used violence to achieve their goals; he argued that \"the Jews should disclaim any intention of realizing their aspiration under the protection of arms and should rely wholly on the goodwill of Arabs. No exception can possibly be taken to the natural desire of the Jews to find a home in Palestine. But they must wait for its fulfillment till Arab opinion is ripe for it. \" In 1938, Gandhi stated that his \"sympathies are all with the Jews. I have known them intimately in South Africa. Some of them became life-long companions. \" Philosopher Martin Buber was highly critical of Gandhi's approach and in 1939 wrote an open letter to him on the subject. Gandhi reiterated his stance that \"the Jews seek to convert the Arab heart\", and use \"satyagraha in confronting the Arabs\" in 1947. According to Simone Panter-Brick, Gandhi's political position on Jewish-Arab conflict evolved over the 1917-1947 period, shifting from a support for the Arab position first, and for the Jewish position in the 1940s.\nGandhi criticised as well as praised Christianity. He was critical of Christian missionary efforts in British India, because they mixed medical or education assistance with demands that the beneficiary convert to Christianity. According to Gandhi, this was not true \"service\" but one driven by ulterior motive of luring people into religious conversion and exploiting the economically or medically desperate. It did not lead to inner transformation or moral advance or to the Christian teaching of \"love\", but was based on false one-sided criticisms of other religions, when Christian societies faced similar problems in South Africa and Europe. It led to the converted person hating his neighbours and others religions, it divided people rather than bringing them closer in compassion. According to Gandhi, \"no religious tradition could claim a monopoly over truth or salvation\". Gandhi did not support laws to prohibit missionary activity, but demanded that Christians should first understand the message of Jesus, and then strive to live without stereotyping and misrepresenting other religions. According to Gandhi, the message of Jesus wasn't to humiliate and imperialistically rule over other people considering them inferior or second class or slaves, but that \"when the hungry are fed and peace comes to our individual and collective life, then Christ is born\". Gandhi believed that his long acquaintance with Christianity had made him like it as well as find it imperfect. He asked Christians to stop humiliating his country and his people as heathens, idolators and other abusive language, and to change their negative views of India. He believed that Christians should introspect on the \"true meaning of religion\" and get a desire to study and learn from Indian religions in the spirit of universal brotherhood. According to Eric Sharpe – a professor of Religious Studies, though Gandhi was born in a Hindu family and later became Hindu by conviction, many Christians in time thought of him as an \"exemplary Christian and even as a saint\".\nGandhi believed there were material contradictions between Hinduism and Islam, and he shared his thoughts on the Quran and Muslims many times. He stated in 1925, for example, that he had not criticised the teachings of the Quran, but he did criticise the interpreters of Quran. Gandhi believed that numerous interpreters have interpreted it to fit their preconceived notions. He believed Muslims should welcome criticism of Quran, because \"every true scripture only gains from criticism\". Gandhi criticised Muslims who \"betray intolerance of criticism by a non-Muslim of anything related to Islam\", such as the penalty of stoning to death under Islamic law. To Gandhi, Islam has \"nothing to fear from criticism even if it be unreasonable\". According to him, Islam like communism was too quick in resorting to violence. One of the strategies Gandhi adopted was to work with Muslim leaders of pre-partition India, to oppose the British imperialism in and outside the Indian subcontinent. After the World War I, in 1919–22, he won Muslim leadership support of Ali Brothers by backing the Khilafat Movement in favour the Islamic Caliph and his historic Ottoman Caliphate, and opposing the secular Islam supporting Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. By 1924, Ataturk had ended the Caliphate, the Khilafat Movement was over, and Muslim support for Gandhi had largely evaporated. In 1925, Gandhi gave another reason to why he got involved in the Khilafat movement and the Middle East affairs between Britain and the Ottoman Empire. Gandhi explained to his co-religionists (Hindu) that he sympathised and campaigned for the Islamic cause, not because he cared for the Sultan, but because \"I wanted to enlist the Mussalman's sympathy in the matter of cow protection\". According to the historian M. Naeem Qureshi, like the then Indian Muslim leaders who had combined religion and politics, Gandhi too imported his religion into his political strategy during the Khilafat movement. In the 1940s, Gandhi pooled ideas with some Muslim leaders who sought religious harmony like him, and opposed the proposed partition of British India into India and Pakistan. For example, his close friend Badshah Khan suggested that they should work towards opening Hindu temples for Muslim prayers, and Islamic mosques for Hindu prayers, to bring the two religious groups closer. Gandhi accepted this and began having Muslim prayers read in Hindu temples to play his part, but was unable to get Hindu prayers read in mosques. The Hindu nationalist groups objected and began confronting Gandhi for this one-sided practice, by shouting and demonstrating inside the Hindu temples, in the last years of his life.\nGandhi believed that Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism were traditions of Hinduism, with shared history, rites and ideas. At other times, he acknowledged that he knew little about Buddhism other than his reading of Edwin Arnold's book on it. Based on that book, he considered Buddhism to be a reform movement and the Buddha to be a Hindu. He stated he knew Jainism much more, and he credited Jains to have profoundly influenced him. Sikhism, to Gandhi, was an integral part of Hinduism, in the form of another reform movement. Sikh and Buddhist leaders disagreed with Gandhi, a disagreement Gandhi respected as a difference of opinion.\nGandhi was brought up as a vegetarian by his devout Hindu mother. The idea of vegetarianism is deeply ingrained in Hindu Vaishnavism and Jain traditions in India, such as in his native Gujarat, where meat is considered as a form of food obtained by violence to animals. Gandhi's rationale for vegetarianism was largely along those found in Hindu and Jain texts. Gandhi believed that any form of food inescapably harms some form of living organism, but one should seek to understand and reduce the violence in what one consumes because \"there is essential unity of all life\". Gandhi believed that some life forms are more capable of suffering, and non-violence to him meant not having the intent as well as active efforts to minimise hurt, injury or suffering to all life forms. Gandhi explored food sources that reduced violence to various life forms in the food chain. He believed that slaughtering animals is unnecessary, as other sources of foods are available. He also consulted with vegetarianism campaigners during his lifetime, such as with Henry Stephens Salt. Food to Gandhi was not only a source of sustaining one's body, but a source of his impact on other living beings, and one that affected his mind, character and spiritual well being. He avoided not only meat, but also eggs and milk. Gandhi wrote the book The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism and wrote for the London Vegetarian Society's publication. Beyond his religious beliefs, Gandhi stated another motivation for his experiments with diet. He attempted to find the most non-violent vegetarian meal that the poorest human could afford, taking meticulous notes on vegetables and fruits, and his observations with his own body and his ashram in Gujarat. He tried fresh and dry fruits (Fruitarianism), then just sun dried fruits, before resuming his prior vegetarian diet on advice of his doctor and concerns of his friends. His experiments with food began in 1890s and continued for several decades. For some of these experiments, Gandhi combined his own ideas with those found on diet in Indian yoga texts. He believed that each vegetarian should experiment with his or her diet because, in his studies at his ashram he saw \"one man's food may be poison for another\". Gandhi championed animal rights in general. Other than making vegetarian choices, he actively campaigned against dissection studies and experimentation on live animals (vivisection) in the name of science and medical studies. He considered it a violence against animals, something that inflicted pain and suffering. He wrote, \"Vivisection in my opinion is the blackest of all the blackest crimes that man is at present committing against god and his fair creation. \"\nGandhi used fasting as a political device, often threatening suicide unless demands were met. Congress publicised the fasts as a political action that generated widespread sympathy. In response the government tried to manipulate news coverage to minimise his challenge to the Raj. He fasted in 1932 to protest the voting scheme for separate political representation for Dalits; Gandhi did not want them segregated. The British government stopped the London press from showing photographs of his emaciated body, because it would elicit sympathy. Gandhi's 1943 hunger strike took place during a two-year prison term for the anticolonial Quit India movement. The government called on nutritional experts to demystify his action, and again no photos were allowed. However, his final fast in 1948, after the end of British rule in India, his hunger strike was lauded by the British press and this time did include full-length photos. Alter states that Gandhi's fasting, vegetarianism and diet was more than a political leverage, it was a part of his experiments with self restraint and healthy living. He was \"profoundly skeptical of traditional Ayurveda\", encouraging it to study the scientific method and adopt its progressive learning approach. Gandhi believed yoga offered health benefits. He believed that a healthy nutritional diet based on regional foods and hygiene were essential to good health.\nGandhi strongly favoured the emancipation of women, and urged \"the women to fight for their own self-development. \" He opposed purdah, child marriage, dowry and sati. A wife is not a slave of the husband, stated Gandhi, but his comrade, better half, colleague and friend, according to Lyn Norvell. In his own life however, according to Suruchi Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi's relationship with his wife were at odds with some of these values. At various occasions, Gandhi credited his orthodox Hindu mother, and his wife, for first lessons in satyagraha. He used the legends of Hindu goddess Sita to expound women's innate strength, autonomy and \"lioness in spirit\" whose moral compass can make any demon \"as helpless as a goat\". To Gandhi, the women of India were an important part of the \"swadeshi movement\" (Buy Indian), and his goal of decolonising the Indian economy. Some historians such as Angela Woollacott and Kumari Jayawardena state that even though Gandhi often and publicly expressed his belief in the equality of sexes, yet his vision was one of gender difference and complementarity between them. Women, to Gandhi, should be educated to be better in the domestic realm and educate the next generation. His views on women's right were less liberal and more similar to puritan-Victorian expectations of women, states Jayawardena, than other Hindu leaders with him who supported economic independence and equal gender rights in all aspects.\nAlong with many other texts, Gandhi studied Bhagavad Gita while in South Africa. This Hindu scripture discusses jnana yoga, bhakti yoga and karma yoga along with virtues such as non-violence, patience, integrity, lack of hypocrisy, self restraint and abstinence. Gandhi began experiments with these, and in 1906 at age 37, although married and a father, he vowed to abstain from sexual relations. Gandhi's experiment with abstinence went beyond sex, and extended to food. He consulted the Jain scholar Rajchandra, whom he fondly called Raychandbhai. Rajchandra advised him that milk stimulated sexual passion. Gandhi began abstaining from cow's milk in 1912, and did so even when doctors advised him to consume milk. According to Sankar Ghose, Tagore described Gandhi as someone who did not abhor sex or women, but considered sexual life as inconsistent with his moral goals. Gandhi tried to test and prove to himself his brahmacharya. The experiments began some time after the death of his wife in February 1944. At the start of his experiment he had women sleep in the same room but in different beds. He later slept with women in the same bed but clothed, and finally he slept naked with women. In April 1945, Gandhi referenced being naked with several \"women or girls\" in a letter to Birla as part of the experiments. According to the 1960s memoir of his grandniece Manu, Gandhi feared in early 1947 that he and she may be killed by Muslims in the run up to India's independence in August 1947, and asked her when she was 18-year-old if she wanted to help him with his experiments to test their \"purity\", for which she readily accepted. Gandhi slept naked in the same bed with Manu with the bedroom doors open all night. Manu stated that the experiment had no \"ill effect\" on her. Gandhi also shared his bed with 18-year-old Abha, wife of his grandnephew Kanu. Gandhi would sleep with both Manu and Abha at the same time. None of the women who participated in the brahmachari experiments of Gandhi indicated that they had sex or that Gandhi behaved in any sexual way. Those who went public said they felt as though they were sleeping with their ageing mother. According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in his final year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly skeletal figure, already caricatured in the Western media. In February 1947, he asked his confidants such as Birla and Ramakrishna if it was wrong for him to experiment his brahmacharya oath. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi said that if he would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Some of his staff resigned, including two of his newspaper's editors who had refused to print some of Gandhi's sermons dealing with his experiments. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.\nGandhi spoke out against untouchability early in his life. Before 1932, he and his colleagues used the term Antyaja for untouchables. One of the major speeches he made on untouchability was at Nagpur in 1920, where he called untouchability as a great evil in Hindu society. In his remarks, he stated that the phenomena of untouchability is not unique to the Hindu society, but has deeper roots because Europeans in South Africa treat \"all of us, Hindus and Muslims, as untouchables; we may not reside in their midst, nor enjoy the rights which they do\". He called it intolerable. He stated this practice can be eradicated, Hinduism is flexible to allow this, and a concerted effort is needed to persuade it is wrong and by all to eradicate it. According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi considered untouchability to be wrong and evil, he believed that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority. Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but no one should expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual regardless of his or her background, stated Gandhi, has a right to choose who they welcome into their home, who they befriend and who they spend time with. In 1932, Gandhi began a new campaign to improve the lives of the untouchables, whom he started referring to as Harijans or \"the children of god\". On 8 May 1933, Gandhi began a 21-day fast of self-purification and launched a one-year campaign to help the Harijan movement. This new campaign was not universally embraced within the Dalit community. Ambedkar and his allies felt Gandhi was being paternalistic and was undermining Dalit political rights. Ambedkar described him as \"devious and untrustworthy\". He accused Gandhi as someone who wished to retain the caste system. Ambedkar and Gandhi debated their ideas and concerns, where both tried to persuade each other. In 1935, Ambedkar announced his intentions to leave Hinduism and join Buddhism. According to Sankar Ghose, the announcement shook Gandhi, who reappraised his views and wrote many essays with his views on castes, inter-marriage and what Hinduism says on the subject. These views contrasted with those of Ambedkar. In actual elections of 1937, except for some seats in Mumbai where Ambekar's party won, India's untouchables voted heavily in favour of Gandhi's campaign and his party, the Congress. Gandhi and his colleagues continued to consult Ambedkar, keeping him influential. Ambedkar worked with other Congress leaders through the 1940s, wrote large parts of India's constitution in late 1940s, and converted to Buddhism in 1956. According to Jaffrelot, Gandhi's views evolved between 1920s and 1940s, when in 1946 he actively encouraged inter-marriage across castes. However, Gandhi's approach to untouchability was different than Ambedkar because Gandhi championed fusion, choice and free intermixing. Ambedkar, in contrast states Jeffrelot, envisioned each segment of society to maintain their identity group, and each group then separately advanced the \"politics of equality\". The criticism of Gandhi by Ambedkar continued to influence the Dalit movement past Gandhi's death. According to Arthur Herman, Ambedkar's hate for Gandhi and Gandhi's ideas was so strong that after he heard the news of Gandhi's assassination, remarked after a momentary silence a sense of regret and then \"my real enemy is gone; thank goodness the eclipse is over now\". ; Laxman Kawale, ''Dalit's Social Transformation: Redefining the Social Justice'', ISRJ, Volume 1, Issue XII, page 3; Quote: \"Even though Ambedkar was a party to Poona Pact, he was never reconciled to it. His contempt against Gandhi which was [sic] continued even after his assassination on January 30, 1948. On the death of Gandhi he expressed, \"My real enemy has gone; thank goodness the eclipse is over\". He equated the assassination of Gandhi with that of Caesar and the remark of Cicero to the messenger – \"Tell the Romans, your hour of liberty has come\". He further remarked, \"While one regrets the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, one cannot help finding in his heart the echo of the sentiments expressed by Cicero on the assassination of Caesar\". According to Ramachandra Guha, \"ideologues have carried these old rivalries into the present, with the demonization of Gandhi now common among politicians who presume to speak in Ambedkar's name.\nGandhi rejected the colonial Western format of education system. He stated that it led to disdain for manual work, generally created an elite administrative bureaucracy. Gandhi favoured an education system with far greater emphasis on learning skills in practical and useful work, one that included physical, mental and spiritual studies. His methodology sought to treat all professions equal and pay everyone the same. Gandhi called his ideas Nai Talim (literally, 'new education'). He believed that the Western style education violated and destroyed the indigenous cultures. A different basic education model, he believed, would lead to better self awareness, prepare people to treat all work equally respectable and valued, and lead to a society with less social diseases. Nai Talim evolved out of his experiences at the Tolstoy Farm in South Africa, and Gandhi attempted to formulate the new system at the Sevagram ashram after 1937. Nehru government's vision of an industrialised, centrally planned economy after 1947 had scant place for Gandhi's village-oriented approach. In his autobiography, Gandhi wrote that he believed every Hindu boy and girl must learn Sanskrit because its historic and spiritual texts are in that language.\nGandhi believed that swaraj not only can be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence. Military is unnecessary, because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While military is unnecessary in a nation organised under swaraj principle, Gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature. However, the state would limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force. According to Gandhi, a non-violent state is like an \"ordered anarchy\". In a society of mostly non-violent individuals, those who are violent will sooner or later accept discipline or leave the community, stated Gandhi. He emphasised a society where individuals believed more in learning about their duties and responsibilities, not demanded rights and privileges. On returning from South Africa, when Gandhi received a letter asking for his participation in writing a world charter for human rights, he responded saying, \"in my experience, it is far more important to have a charter for human duties. \" Swaraj to Gandhi did not mean transferring colonial era British power brokering system, favours-driven, bureaucratic, class exploitative structure and mindset into Indian hands. He warned such a transfer would still be English rule, just without the Englishman. \"This is not the Swaraj I want\", said Gandhi. Tewari states that Gandhi saw democracy as more than a system of government; it meant promoting both individuality and the self-discipline of the community. Democracy meant settling disputes in a nonviolent manner; it required freedom of thought and expression. For Gandhi, democracy was a way of life.\nSome scholars state Gandhi supported a religiously diverse India, while others state that the Muslim leaders who championed the partition and creation of a separate Muslim Pakistan considered Gandhi to be Hindu nationalist or revivalist. For example, in his letters to Mohammad Iqbal, Jinnah accused Gandhi to be favouring a Hindu rule and revivalism, that Gandhi led Indian National Congress was a fascist party. In an interview with C.F. Andrews, Gandhi stated that if we believe all religions teach the same message of love and peace between all human beings, then there is neither any rationale nor need for proselytisation or attempts to convert people from one religion to another. Gandhi opposed missionary organisations who criticised Indian religions then attempted to convert followers of Indian religions to Islam or Christianity. In Gandhi's view, those who attempt to convert a Hindu, \"they must harbour in their breasts the belief that Hinduism is an error\" and that their own religion is \"the only true religion\". Gandhi believed that people who demand religious respect and rights must also show the same respect and grant the same rights to followers of other religions. He stated that spiritual studies must encourage \"a Hindu to become a better Hindu, a Mussalman to become a better Mussalman, and a Christian a better Christian. \" According to Gandhi, religion is not about what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god. It is not important to convert or to join any religion, but it is important to improve one's way of life and conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed Gandhi.\nGandhi believed in sarvodaya economic model, which literally means \"welfare, upliftment of all\". This, states Bhatt, was very different economic model than the socialism model championed and followed by free India by Nehru – India's first prime minister. To both, according to Bhatt, removing poverty and unemployment were the objective, but Gandhian economic and development approach preferred adapting technology and infrastructure to suit local situation, in contrast to Nehru's large scale, socialised state owned enterprises. To Gandhi, the economic philosophy that aims at \"greatest good for the greatest number\" was fundamentally flawed, and his alternative proposal sarvodaya set its aim at \"greatest good for all\". He believed that the best economic system not only cared to lift the \"poor, less skilled, of impoverished background\" but also empowered to lift the \"rich, highly skilled, of capital means and landlords\". Violence against any human being, born poor or rich, is wrong believed Gandhi. He stated that mandate theory of majoritarian democracy shouldn't be pushed to absurd extremes, individual freedoms should never be denied, and no person should ever be made a social or economic slave to the \"resolutions of majorities\". Gandhi challenged Nehru and the modernizers in the late 1930s who called for rapid industrialisation on the Soviet model; Gandhi denounced that as dehumanising and contrary to the needs of the villages where the great majority of the people lived. After Gandhi's assassination, Nehru led India in accordance with his personal socialist convictions. Historian Kuruvilla Pandikattu says \"it was Nehru's vision, not Gandhi's, that was eventually preferred by the Indian State. \" Gandhi called for ending poverty through improved agriculture and small-scale cottage rural industries. Gandhi's economic thinking disagreed with Marx, according to the political theory scholar and economist Bhikhu Parekh. Gandhi refused to endorse the view that economic forces are best understood as \"antagonistic class interests\". He argued that no man can degrade or brutalise the other without degrading and brutalising himself, that sustainable economic growth comes from service, not from exploitation. Further, believed Gandhi, that in a free nation, victims exist only when they co-operate with their oppressor, and an economic and political system that offered increasing alternatives gave power of choice to the poorest man. While disagreeing with Nehru about socialist economic model, Gandhi also critiqued capitalism that was driven by endless wants and a materialistic view of man. This, he believed, created a vicious vested system of materialism at the cost of other human needs such as spirituality and social relationships. To Gandhi, states Parekh, both communism and capitalism were wrong, in part because both focussed exclusively on materialistic view of man, and because the former deified the state with unlimited power of violence, while the latter deified capital. A better economic system is one which does not impoverish one's culture and spiritual pursuits.\nGandhism designates the ideas and principles Gandhi promoted. Of central importance is nonviolent resistance. A can mean either an individual who follows, or a specific philosophy which is attributed to, Gandhism. M. M. Sankhdher argues that Gandhism is not a systematic position in metaphysics or in political philosophy. Rather, it is a political creed, an economic doctrine, a religious outlook, a moral precept, and especially, a humanitarian world view. It is an effort not to systematise wisdom but to transform society and is based on an undying faith in the goodness of human nature. However Gandhi himself did not approve of the notion of \"Gandhism\", as he explained in 1936:\nGandhi was a prolific writer. One of Gandhi's earliest publications, Hind Swaraj, published in Gujarati in 1909, became \"the intellectual blueprint\" for India's independence movement. The book was translated into English the next year, with a copyright legend that read \"No Rights Reserved\". For decades he edited several newspapers including Harijan in Gujarati, in Hindi and in the English language; Indian Opinion while in South Africa and, Young India, in English, and Navajivan, a Gujarati monthly, on his return to India. Later, Navajivan was also published in Hindi. In addition, he wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers. Gandhi also wrote several books including his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth (Gujarātī \"સત્યના પ્રયોગો અથવા આત્મકથા\"), of which he bought the entire first edition to make sure it was reprinted. His other autobiographies included: Satyagraha in South Africa about his struggle there, Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule, a political pamphlet, and a paraphrase in Gujarati of John Ruskin's Unto This Last. This last essay can be considered his programme on economics. He also wrote extensively on vegetarianism, diet and health, religion, social reforms, etc. Gandhi usually wrote in Gujarati, though he also revised the Hindi and English translations of his books. Gandhi's complete works were published by the Indian government under the name The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi in the 1960s. The writings comprise about 50,000 pages published in about a hundred volumes. In 2000, a revised edition of the complete works sparked a controversy, as it contained a large number of errors and omissions. The Indian government later withdrew the revised edition.\nGandhi influenced important leaders and political movements. Leaders of the civil rights movement in the United States, including Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, and James Bevel, drew from the writings of Gandhi in the development of their own theories about nonviolence. King said \"Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the tactics. \" King sometimes referred to Gandhi as \"the little brown saint. \" Anti-apartheid activist and former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, was inspired by Gandhi. Others include Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Steve Biko, and Aung San Suu Kyi. In his early years, the former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela was a follower of the nonviolent resistance philosophy of Gandhi. Bhana and Vahed commented on these events as \"Gandhi inspired succeeding generations of South African activists seeking to end White rule. This legacy connects him to Nelson Mandela...in a sense Mandela completed what Gandhi started. \" Gandhi's life and teachings inspired many who specifically referred to Gandhi as their mentor or who dedicated their lives to spreading Gandhi's ideas. In Europe, Romain Rolland was the first to discuss Gandhi in his 1924 book Mahatma Gandhi, and Brazilian anarchist and feminist Maria Lacerda de Moura wrote about Gandhi in her work on pacifism. In 1931, notable European physicist Albert Einstein exchanged written letters with Gandhi, and called him \"a role model for the generations to come\" in a letter writing about him. Einstein said of Gandhi: Mahatma Gandhi's life achievement stands unique in political history. He has invented a completely new and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only be the work of such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come. Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood. Lanza del Vasto went to India in 1936 intending to live with Gandhi; he later returned to Europe to spread Gandhi's philosophy and founded the Community of the Ark in 1948 (modelled after Gandhi's ashrams). Madeleine Slade (known as \"Mirabehn\") was the daughter of a British admiral who spent much of her adult life in India as a devotee of Gandhi. In addition, the British musician John Lennon referred to Gandhi when discussing his views on nonviolence. At the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival in 2007, former US Vice-President and environmentalist Al Gore spoke of Gandhi's influence on him.<ref name=\"Al Gore\"> US President Barack Obama in a 2010 address to the Parliament of India said that: I am mindful that I might not be standing before you today, as President of the United States, had it not been for Gandhi and the message he shared with America and the world. Obama in September 2009 said that his biggest inspiration came from Gandhi. His reply was in response to the question 'Who was the one person, dead or live, that you would choose to dine with?'. He continued that \"He's somebody I find a lot of inspiration in. He inspired Dr. King with his message of nonviolence. He ended up doing so much and changed the world just by the power of his ethics. \" Time Magazine named The 14th Dalai Lama, Lech Wałęsa, Martin Luther King, Cesar Chavez, Aung San Suu Kyi, Benigno Aquino, Jr., Desmond Tutu, and Nelson Mandela as Children of Gandhi and his spiritual heirs to nonviolence. The Mahatma Gandhi District in Houston, Texas, United States, an ethnic Indian enclave, is officially named after Gandhi.\nIn 2007, the United Nations General Assembly declared Gandhi's birthday 2 October as \"the International Day of Nonviolence. \" First proposed by UNESCO in 1948, as the School Day of Nonviolence and Peace (DENIP in Spanish), 30 January is observed as the School Day of Nonviolence and Peace in schools of many countries In countries with a Southern Hemisphere school calendar, it is observed on 30 March.\nTime magazine named Gandhi the Man of the Year in 1930. Gandhi was also the runner-up to Albert Einstein as \"Person of the Century\" at the end of 1999. The Government of India awarded the annual Gandhi Peace Prize to distinguished social workers, world leaders and citizens. Nelson Mandela, the leader of South Africa's struggle to eradicate racial discrimination and segregation, was a prominent non-Indian recipient. In 2011, Time magazine named Gandhi as one of the top 25 political icons of all time. Gandhi did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize, although he was nominated five times between 1937 and 1948, including the first-ever nomination by the American Friends Service Committee, though he made the short list only twice, in 1937 and 1947. Decades later, the Nobel Committee publicly declared its regret for the omission, and admitted to deeply divided nationalistic opinion denying the award. Gandhi was nominated in 1948 but was assassinated before nominations closed. That year, the committee chose not to award the peace prize stating that \"there was no suitable living candidate\" and later research shows that the possibility of awarding the prize posthumously to Gandhi was discussed and that the reference to no suitable living candidate was to Gandhi. Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said, \"The greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question\". When the 14th Dalai Lama was awarded the Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was \"in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi\".\nIndians widely describe Gandhi as the father of the nation. Origin of this title is traced back to a radio address (on Singapore radio) on 6 July 1944 by Subhash Chandra Bose where Bose addressed Gandhi as \"The Father of the Nation\". On 28 April 1947, Sarojini Naidu during a conference also referred Gandhi as \"Father of the Nation\".\nA 5 hours, 9 minutes long biographical documentary film, Mahatma: Life of Gandhi, 1869–1948, made by Vithalbhai Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi's words and using black & white archival footage and photographs, captures the history of those times. Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The 1996 film The Making of the Mahatma documented Gandhi's time in South Africa and his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised political leader. Gandhi was a central figure in the 2006 Bollywood comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Jahnu Barua's Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (I did not kill Gandhi), places contemporary society as a backdrop with its vanishing memory of Gandhi's values as a metaphor for the senile forgetfulness of the protagonist of his 2005 film, writes Vinay Lal. The 1979 opera Satyagraha by American composer Philip Glass is loosely based on Gandhi's life. The opera's libretto, taken from the Bhagavad Gita, is sung in the original Sanskrit. Anti-Gandhi themes have also been showcased through films and plays. The 1995 Marathi play Gandhi Virudh Gandhi explored the relationship between Gandhi and his son Harilal. The 2007 film, Gandhi, My Father was inspired on the same theme. The 1989 Marathi play Me Nathuram Godse Boltoy and the 1997 Hindi play Gandhi Ambedkar criticised Gandhi and his principles. Several biographers have undertaken the task of describing Gandhi's life. Among them are D. G. Tendulkar with his Mahatma. Life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in eight volumes, Chaman Nahal's Gandhi Quartet, and Pyarelal and Sushila Nayyar with their Mahatma Gandhi in 10 volumes. The 2010 biography, Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi and His Struggle With India by Joseph Lelyveld contained controversial material speculating about Gandhi's sexual life.<ref name=\"LelyveldNYT\"> (Review of Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi and His Struggle With India by Joseph Lelyveld). Lelyveld, however, stated that the press coverage \"grossly distort[s]\" the overall message of the book. The 2014 film Welcome Back Gandhi takes a fictionalised look at how Gandhi might react to modern day India. \"Mahatma Gandhi\" is used by Cole Porter in his lyrics for the song You're the Top which is included in the 1934 musical Anything Goes. In the song Porter rhymes \"Mahatma Gandhi' with \"Napoleon Brandy.\nIndia, with its rapid economic modernisation and urbanisation, has rejected Gandhi's economics but accepted much of his politics and continues to revere his memory. Reporter Jim Yardley notes that, \"modern India is hardly a Gandhian nation, if it ever was one. His vision of a village-dominated economy was shunted aside during his lifetime as rural romanticism, and his call for a national ethos of personal austerity and nonviolence has proved antithetical to the goals of an aspiring economic and military power. \" By contrast Gandhi is \"given full credit for India's political identity as a tolerant, secular democracy. \" Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is a national holiday in India, Gandhi Jayanti. Gandhi's image also appears on paper currency of all denominations issued by Reserve Bank of India, except for the one rupee note. Gandhi's date of death, 30 January, is commemorated as a Martyrs' Day in India. There are three temples in India dedicated to Gandhi. One is located at Sambalpur in Orissa and the second at Nidaghatta village near Kadur in Chikmagalur district of Karnataka and the third one at Chityal in the district of Nalgonda, Telangana. The Gandhi Memorial in Kanyakumari resembles central Indian Hindu temples and the Tamukkam or Summer Palace in Madurai now houses the Mahatma Gandhi Museum.\n"]
