He had\nbright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long\nbit of black india-rubber.  The little ducks were swimming about in the\npond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who\nwas pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand\non their heads in the water.\n\n“You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your\nheads,” she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them\nhow it was done.  But the little ducks paid no attention to her.  They\nwere so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in\nsociety at all.\n\n“What disobedient children!” cried the old Water-rat; “they really\ndeserve to be drowned.”\n\n“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, “every one must make a\nbeginning, and parents cannot be too patient.”\n\n“Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,” said the Water-rat;\n“I am not a family man.  In fact, I have never been married, and I never\nintend to be.  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much\nhigher.  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or\nrarer than a devoted friendship.”\n\n“And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?” asked a\nGreen Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard\nthe conversation.\n\n“Yes, that is just what I want to know,” said the Duck; and she swam away\nto the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her\nchildren a good example.\n\n“What a silly question!” cried the Water-rat.  “I should expect my\ndevoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.”\n\n“And what would you do in return?” said the little bird, swinging upon a\nsilver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.\n\n“I don’t understand you,” answered the Water-rat.\n\n“Let me tell you a story on the subject,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Is the story about me?” asked the Water-rat.  “If so, I will listen to\nit, for I am extremely fond of fiction.”\n\n“It is applicable to you,” answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and\nalighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.\n\n“Once upon a time,” said the Linnet, “there was an honest little fellow\nnamed Hans.”\n\n“Was he very distinguished?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“No,” answered the Linnet, “I don’t think he was distinguished at all,\nexcept for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.  He\nlived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his\ngarden.  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.\nSweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds’-purses, and\nFair-maids of France.  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac\nCrocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white.  Columbine and Ladysmock,\nMarjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil\nand the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the\nmonths went by, one flower taking another flower’s place, so that there\nwere always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.\n\n“Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all\nwas big Hugh the Miller.  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to\nlittle Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over\nthe wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or\nfilling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.\n\n“‘Real friends should have everything in common,’ the Miller used to say,\nand little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend\nwith such noble ideas.\n\n“Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich\nMiller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred\nsacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large\nflock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these\nthings, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the\nwonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true\nfriendship.\n\n“So little Hans worked away in his garden.  During the spring, the\nsummer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and\nhe had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good\ndeal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper\nbut a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  In the winter, also, he was\nextremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.\n\n“‘There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow\nlasts,’ the Miller used to say to his wife, ‘for when people are in\ntrouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.  That\nat least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.  So I\nshall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and\nhe will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make\nhim so happy.’\n\n“‘You are certainly very thoughtful about others,’ answered the Wife, as\nshe sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; ‘very\nthoughtful indeed.  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about\nfriendship.  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful\nthings as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear\na gold ring on his little finger.’\n\n“‘But could we not ask little Hans up here?’ said the Miller’s youngest\nson.  ‘If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and\nshow him my white rabbits.’\n\n“‘What a silly boy you are!’ cried the Miller; ‘I really don’t know what\nis the use of sending you to school.  You seem not to learn anything.\nWhy, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good\nsupper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is\na most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody’s nature.  I certainly\nwill not allow Hans’ nature to be spoiled.  I am his best friend, and I\nwill always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any\ntemptations.  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have\nsome flour on credit, and that I could not do.  Flour is one thing, and\nfriendship is another, and they should not be confused.  Why, the words\nare spelt differently, and mean quite different things.  Everybody can\nsee that.’\n\n“‘How well you talk!’ said the Miller’s Wife, pouring herself out a large\nglass of warm ale; ‘really I feel quite drowsy.  It is just like being in\nchurch.’\n\n“‘Lots of people act well,’ answered the Miller; ‘but very few people\ntalk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of\nthe two, and much the finer thing also’; and he looked sternly across the\ntable at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his\nhead down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.\nHowever, he was so young that you must excuse him.”\n\n“Is that the end of the story?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Certainly not,” answered the Linnet, “that is the beginning.”\n\n“Then you are quite behind the age,” said the Water-rat.  “Every good\nstory-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the\nbeginning, and concludes with the middle.  That is the new method.  I\nheard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the\npond with a young man.  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am\nsure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head,\nand whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered ‘Pooh!’\nBut pray go on with your story.  I like the Miller immensely.  I have all\nkinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy\nbetween us.”\n\n“Well,” said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, “as\nsoon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale\nyellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see\nlittle Hans.\n\n“‘Why, what a good heart you have!’ cried his Wife; ‘you are always\nthinking of others.  And mind you take the big basket with you for the\nflowers.’\n\n“So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron\nchain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.\n\n“‘Good morning, little Hans,’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Good morning,’ said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to\near.\n\n“‘And how have you been all the winter?’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ cried Hans, ‘it is very good of you to ask, very good\nindeed.  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring\nhas come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.’\n\n“‘We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘and\nwondered how you were getting on.’\n\n“‘That was kind of you,’ said Hans; ‘I was half afraid you had forgotten\nme.’\n\n“‘Hans, I am surprised at you,’ said the Miller; ‘friendship never\nforgets.  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don’t\nunderstand the poetry of life.  How lovely your primroses are looking,\nby-the-bye!”\n\n“‘They are certainly very lovely,’ said Hans, ‘and it is a most lucky\nthing for me that I have so many.  I am going to bring them into the\nmarket and sell them to the Burgomaster’s daughter, and buy back my\nwheelbarrow with the money.’\n\n“‘Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don’t mean to say you have sold it?\nWhat a very stupid thing to do!’\n\n“‘Well, the fact is,’ said Hans, ‘that I was obliged to.  You see the\nwinter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to\nbuy bread with.  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat,\nand then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last\nI sold my wheelbarrow.  But I am going to buy them all back again now.’\n\n“‘Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘I will give you my wheelbarrow.  It is not in\nvery good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong\nwith the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.  I\nknow it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me\nextremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the\nworld.  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and,\nbesides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.  Yes, you may set your\nmind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.’\n\n“‘Well, really, that is generous of you,’ said little Hans, and his funny\nround face glowed all over with pleasure.  ‘I can easily put it in\nrepair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.’\n\n“‘A plank of wood!’ said the Miller; ‘why, that is just what I want for\nthe roof of my barn.  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will\nall get damp if I don’t stop it up.  How lucky you mentioned it!  It is\nquite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.  I have given\nyou my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.  Of\ncourse, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true,\nfriendship never notices things like that.  Pray get it at once, and I\nwill set to work at my barn this very day.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the\nplank out.\n\n“‘It is not a very big plank,’ said the Miller, looking at it, ‘and I am\nafraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won’t be any left for\nyou to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault.\nAnd now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to\ngive me some flowers in return.  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it\nquite full.’\n\n“‘Quite full?’ said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a\nvery big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no\nflowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver\nbuttons back.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘as I have given you my\nwheelbarrow, I don’t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.\nI may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true\nfriendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.’\n\n“‘My dear friend, my best friend,’ cried little Hans, ‘you are welcome to\nall the flowers in my garden.  I would much sooner have your good opinion\nthan my silver buttons, any day’; and he ran and plucked all his pretty\nprimroses, and filled the Miller’s basket.\n\n“‘Good-bye, little Hans,’ said the Miller, as he went up the hill with\nthe plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.\n\n“‘Good-bye,’ said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he\nwas so pleased about the wheelbarrow.\n\n“The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when\nhe heard the Miller’s voice calling to him from the road.  So he jumped\noff the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.\n\n“There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘would you mind carrying this sack\nof flour for me to market?’\n\n“‘Oh, I am so sorry,’ said Hans, ‘but I am really very busy to-day.  I\nhave got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all\nmy grass to roll.’\n\n“‘Well, really,’ said the Miller, ‘I think that, considering that I am\ngoing to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to\nrefuse.’\n\n“‘Oh, don’t say that,’ cried little Hans, ‘I wouldn’t be unfriendly for\nthe whole world’; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big\nsack on his shoulders.\n\n“It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans\nhad reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down\nand rest.  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the\nmarket.  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour\nfor a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was\nafraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.\n\n“‘It has certainly been a hard day,’ said little Hans to himself as he\nwas going to bed, ‘but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is\nmy best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.’\n\n“Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his\nsack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.\n\n“‘Upon my word,’ said the Miller, ‘you are very lazy.  Really,\nconsidering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might\nwork harder.  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don’t like any of\nmy friends to be idle or sluggish.  You must not mind my speaking quite\nplainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not\nyour friend.  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say\nexactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to\nplease and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things,\nand does not mind giving pain.  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he\nprefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off\nhis night-cap, ‘but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for\na little time, and listen to the birds singing.  Do you know that I\nalways work better after hearing the birds sing?’\n\n“‘Well, I am glad of that,’ said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the\nback, ‘for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed,\nand mend my barn-roof for me.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his\nflowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse\nthe Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.\n\n“‘Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?’ he\ninquired in a shy and timid voice.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘I do not think it is much to ask\nof you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of\ncourse if you refuse I will go and do it myself.’\n\n“‘Oh! on no account,’ cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and\ndressed himself, and went up to the barn.\n\n“He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came\nto see how he was getting on.\n\n“‘Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?’ cried the\nMiller in a cheery voice.\n\n“‘It is quite mended,’ answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.\n\n“‘Ah!’ said the Miller, ‘there is no work so delightful as the work one\ndoes for others.’\n\n“‘It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,’ answered little\nHans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, ‘a very great privilege.\nBut I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.’\n\n“‘Oh! they will come to you,’ said the Miller, ‘but you must take more\npains.  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you\nwill have the theory also.’\n\n“‘Do you really think I shall?’ asked little Hans.\n\n“‘I have no doubt of it,’ answered the Miller, ‘but now that you have\nmended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive\nmy sheep to the mountain to-morrow.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next\nmorning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans\nstarted off with them to the mountain.  It took him the whole day to get\nthere and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to\nsleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.\n\n“‘What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,’ he said, and he went\nto work at once.\n\n“But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his\nfriend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long\nerrands, or getting him to help at the mill.  Little Hans was very much\ndistressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had\nforgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller\nwas his best friend.  ‘Besides,’ he used to say, ‘he is going to give me\nhis wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.’\n\n“So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds\nof beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a\nnote-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good\nscholar.\n\n“Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside\nwhen a loud rap came at the door.  It was a very wild night, and the wind\nwas blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he\nthought it was merely the storm.  But a second rap came, and then a\nthird, louder than any of the others.\n\n“‘It is some poor traveller,’ said little Hans to himself, and he ran to\nthe door.\n\n“There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the\nother.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ cried the Miller, ‘I am in great trouble.  My little\nboy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the\nDoctor.  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it\nhas just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead\nof me.  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is\nonly fair that you should do something for me in return.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, ‘I take it quite as a compliment your\ncoming to me, and I will start off at once.  But you must lend me your\nlantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the\nditch.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ answered the Miller, ‘but it is my new lantern, and\nit would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.’\n\n“‘Well, never mind, I will do without it,’ cried little Hans, and he took\ndown his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler\nround his throat, and started off.\n\n“What a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans\ncould hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely\nstand.  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking\nabout three hours, he arrived at the Doctor’s house, and knocked at the\ndoor.\n\n“‘Who is there?’ cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom\nwindow.\n\n“‘Little Hans, Doctor.’\n\n“’What do you want, little Hans?’\n\n“‘The Miller’s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and\nthe Miller wants you to come at once.’\n\n“‘All right!’ said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big\nboots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the\ndirection of the Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him.\n\n“But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and\nlittle Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.\nAt last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very\ndangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans\nwas drowned.  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating\nin a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.\n\n“Everybody went to little Hans’ funeral, as he was so popular, and the\nMiller was the chief mourner.\n\n“‘As I was his best friend,’ said the Miller, ‘it is only fair that I\nshould have the best place’; so he walked at the head of the procession\nin a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a\nbig pocket-handkerchief.\n\n“‘Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,’ said the\nBlacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated\ncomfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.\n\n“‘A great loss to me at any rate,’ answered the Miller; ‘why, I had as\ngood as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don’t know what to do\nwith it.  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair\nthat I could not get anything for it if I sold it.  I will certainly take\ncare not to give away anything again.  One always suffers for being\ngenerous.’”\n\n“Well?” said the Water-rat, after a long pause.\n\n“Well, that is the end,” said the Linnet.\n\n“But what became of the Miller?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Oh!  I really don’t know,” replied the Linnet; “and I am sure that I\ndon’t care.”\n\n“It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,” said\nthe Water-rat.\n\n“I am afraid you don’t quite see the moral of the story,” remarked the\nLinnet.\n\n“The what?” screamed the Water-rat.\n\n“The moral.”\n\n“Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?”\n\n“Certainly,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Well, really,” said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, “I think you\nshould have told me that before you began.  If you had done so, I\ncertainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said\n‘Pooh,’ like the critic.  However, I can say it now”; so he shouted out\n“Pooh” at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back\ninto his hole.\n\n“And how do you like the Water-rat?” asked the Duck, who came paddling up\nsome minutes afterwards.  “He has a great many good points, but for my\nown part I have a mother’s feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed\nbachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.”\n\n“I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,” answered the Linnet.  “The\nfact is, that I told him a story with a moral.”\n\n“Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,” said the Duck.\n\nAnd I quite agree with her.\n\n","I will now play the Oedipus to the Rattleborough enigma. I will expound\nto you--as I alone can--the secret of the enginery that effected the\nRattleborough miracle--the one, the true, the admitted, the undisputed,\nthe indisputable miracle, which put a definite end to infidelity among\nthe Rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the grandames all\nthe carnal-minded who had ventured to be sceptical before.\n\nThis event--which I should be sorry to discuss in a tone of unsuitable\nlevity--occurred in the summer of 18--. Mr. Barnabas Shuttleworthy--one\nof the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of the borough--had\nbeen missing for several days under circumstances which gave rise to\nsuspicion of foul play. Mr. Shuttleworthy had set out from Rattleborough\nvery early one Saturday morning, on horseback, with the avowed intention\nof proceeding to the city of-, about fifteen miles distant, and of\nreturning the night of the same day. Two hours after his departure,\nhowever, his horse returned without him, and without the saddle-bags\nwhich had been strapped on his back at starting. The animal was wounded,\ntoo, and covered with mud. These circumstances naturally gave rise to\nmuch alarm among the friends of the missing man; and when it was found,\non Sunday morning, that he had not yet made his appearance, the whole\nborough arose en masse to go and look for his body.\n\nThe foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom\nfriend of Mr. Shuttleworthy--a Mr. Charles Goodfellow, or, as he was\nuniversally called, “Charley Goodfellow,” or “Old Charley Goodfellow.”\n Now, whether it is a marvellous coincidence, or whether it is that the\nname itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character, I have never\nyet been able to ascertain; but the fact is unquestionable, that there\nnever yet was any person named Charles who was not an open, manly,\nhonest, good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear\nvoice, that did you good to hear it, and an eye that looked you always\nstraight in the face, as much as to say: “I have a clear conscience\nmyself, am afraid of no man, and am altogether above doing a mean\naction.” And thus all the hearty, careless, “walking gentlemen” of the\nstage are very certain to be called Charles.\n\nNow, “Old Charley Goodfellow,” although he had been in Rattleborough\nnot longer than six months or thereabouts, and although nobody knew\nany thing about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood, had\nexperienced no difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all\nthe respectable people in the borough. Not a man of them but would have\ntaken his bare word for a thousand at any moment; and as for the women,\nthere is no saying what they would not have done to oblige him. And all\nthis came of his having been christened Charles, and of his possessing,\nin consequence, that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very “best\nletter of recommendation.”\n\nI have already said that Mr. Shuttleworthy was one of the most\nrespectable and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in\nRattleborough, while “Old Charley Goodfellow” was upon as intimate terms\nwith him as if he had been his own brother. The two old gentlemen were\nnext-door neighbours, and, although Mr. Shuttleworthy seldom, if ever,\nvisited “Old Charley,” and never was known to take a meal in his house,\nstill this did not prevent the two friends from being exceedingly\nintimate, as I have just observed; for “Old Charley” never let a day\npass without stepping in three or four times to see how his neighbour\ncame on, and very often he would stay to breakfast or tea, and almost\nalways to dinner, and then the amount of wine that was made way with by\nthe two cronies at a sitting, it would really be a difficult thing to\nascertain. “Old Charleys” favorite beverage was Chateau-Margaux, and\nit appeared to do Mr. Shuttleworthy’s heart good to see the old fellow\nswallow it, as he did, quart after quart; so that, one day, when the\nwine was in and the wit as a natural consequence, somewhat out, he said\nto his crony, as he slapped him upon the back--“I tell you what it is,\n‘Old Charley,’ you are, by all odds, the heartiest old fellow I ever\ncame across in all my born days; and, since you love to guzzle the wine\nat that fashion, I’ll be darned if I don’t have to make thee a present\nof a big box of the Chateau-Margaux. Od rot me,”--(Mr. Shuttleworthy had\na sad habit of swearing, although he seldom went beyond “Od rot me,” or\n“By gosh,” or “By the jolly golly,”)--“Od rot me,” says he, “if I don’t\nsend an order to town this very afternoon for a double box of the best\nthat can be got, and I’ll make ye a present of it, I will!--ye needn’t\nsay a word now--I will, I tell ye, and there’s an end of it; so look out\nfor it--it will come to hand some of these fine days, precisely when ye\nare looking for it the least!” I mention this little bit of liberality\non the part of Mr. Shuttleworthy, just by way of showing you how very\nintimate an understanding existed between the two friends.\n\nWell, on the Sunday morning in question, when it came to be fairly\nunderstood that Mr. Shuttleworthy had met with foul play, I never saw\nany one so profoundly affected as “Old Charley Goodfellow.” When he\nfirst heard that the horse had come home without his master, and without\nhis master’s saddle-bags, and all bloody from a pistol-shot, that had\ngone clean through and through the poor animal’s chest without quite\nkilling him; when he heard all this, he turned as pale as if the missing\nman had been his own dear brother or father, and shivered and shook all\nover as if he had had a fit of the ague.\n\nAt first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any\nthing at all, or to concert upon any plan of action; so that for a long\ntime he endeavored to dissuade Mr. Shuttleworthy’s other friends from\nmaking a stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile--say for\na week or two, or a month, or two--to see if something wouldn’t turn up,\nor if Mr. Shuttleworthy wouldn’t come in the natural way, and explain\nhis reasons for sending his horse on before. I dare say you have often\nobserved this disposition to temporize, or to procrastinate, in people\nwho are labouring under any very poignant sorrow. Their powers of mind\nseem to be rendered torpid, so that they have a horror of any thing like\naction, and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed\nand “nurse their grief,” as the old ladies express it--that is to say,\nruminate over the trouble.\n\nThe people of Rattleborough had, indeed, so high an opinion of the\nwisdom and discretion of “Old Charley,” that the greater part of them\nfelt disposed to agree with him, and not make a stir in the business\n“until something should turn up,” as the honest old gentleman worded\nit; and I believe that, after all this would have been the general\ndetermination, but for the very suspicious interference of Mr.\nShuttleworthy’s nephew, a young man of very dissipated habits,\nand otherwise of rather bad character. This nephew, whose name was\nPennifeather, would listen to nothing like reason in the matter of\n“lying quiet,” but insisted upon making immediate search for the “corpse\nof the murdered man.”--This was the expression he employed; and Mr.\nGoodfellow acutely remarked at the time, that it was “a singular\nexpression, to say no more.” This remark of ‘Old Charley’s,’ too, had\ngreat effect upon the crowd; and one of the party was heard to ask,\nvery impressively, “how it happened that young Mr. Pennifeather was so\nintimately cognizant of all the circumstances connected with his wealthy\nuncle’s disappearance, as to feel authorized to assert, distinctly\nand unequivocally, that his uncle was ‘a murdered man.’” Hereupon some\nlittle squibbing and bickering occurred among various members of\nthe crowd, and especially between “Old Charley” and Mr.\nPennifeather--although this latter occurrence was, indeed, by no means a\nnovelty, for no good will had subsisted between the parties for the\nlast three or four months; and matters had even gone so far that Mr.\nPennifeather had actually knocked down his uncles friend for some\nalleged excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle’s\nhouse, of which the nephew was an inmate. Upon this occasion “Old\nCharley” is said to have behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian\ncharity. He arose from the blow, adjusted his clothes, and made no\nattempt at retaliation at all--merely muttering a few words about\n“taking summary vengeance at the first convenient opportunity,”--a\nnatural and very justifiable ebullition of anger, which meant nothing,\nhowever, and, beyond doubt, was no sooner given vent to than forgotten.\n\nHowever these matters may be (which have no reference to the point\nnow at issue), it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough,\nprincipally through the persuasion of Mr. Pennifeather, came at length\nto the determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search\nof the missing Mr. Shuttleworthy. I say they came to this determination\nin the first instance. After it had been fully resolved that a search\nshould be made, it was considered almost a matter of course that the\nseekers should disperse--that is to say, distribute themselves in\nparties--for the more thorough examination of the region round about. I\nforget, however, by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that\n“Old Charley” finally convinced the assembly that this was the most\ninjudicious plan that could be pursued. Convince them, however, he\ndid--all except Mr. Pennifeather, and, in the end, it was arranged that\na search should be instituted, carefully and very thoroughly, by the\nburghers en masse, “Old Charley” himself leading the way.\n\nAs for the matter of that, there could have been no better pioneer\nthan “Old Charley,” whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx;\nbut, although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and\ncorners, by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the\nneighbourhood, and although the search was incessantly kept up day and\nnight for nearly a week, still no trace of Mr. Shuttleworthy could be\ndiscovered. When I say no trace, however, I must not be understood to\nspeak literally, for trace, to some extent, there certainly was.\nThe poor gentleman had been tracked, by his horses shoes (which were\npeculiar), to a spot about three miles to the east of the borough,\non the main road leading to the city. Here the track made off into a\nby-path through a piece of woodland--the path coming out again into the\nmain road, and cutting off about half a mile of the regular distance.\nFollowing the shoe-marks down this lane, the party came at length to a\npool of stagnant water, half hidden by the brambles, to the right of the\nlane, and opposite this pool all vestige of the track was lost sight\nof. It appeared, however, that a struggle of some nature had here taken\nplace, and it seemed as if some large and heavy body, much larger and\nheavier than a man, had been drawn from the by-path to the pool. This\nlatter was carefully dragged twice, but nothing was found; and the party\nwas upon the point of going away, in despair of coming to any result,\nwhen Providence suggested to Mr. Goodfellow the expediency of draining\nthe water off altogether. This project was received with cheers,\nand many high compliments to “Old Charley” upon his sagacity and\nconsideration. As many of the burghers had brought spades with them,\nsupposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse,\nthe drain was easily and speedily effected; and no sooner was the\nbottom visible, than right in the middle of the mud that remained was\ndiscovered a black silk velvet waistcoat, which nearly every one\npresent immediately recognized as the property of Mr. Pennifeather. This\nwaistcoat was much torn and stained with blood, and there were several\npersons among the party who had a distinct remembrance of its having\nbeen worn by its owner on the very morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s\ndeparture for the city; while there were others, again, ready to testify\nupon oath, if required, that Mr. P. did not wear the garment in question\nat any period during the remainder of that memorable day, nor could\nany one be found to say that he had seen it upon Mr. P.’s person at any\nperiod at all subsequent to Mr. Shuttleworthy’s disappearance.\n\nMatters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr. Pennifeather, and it was\nobserved, as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were\nexcited against him, that he grew exceedingly pale, and when asked\nwhat he had to say for himself, was utterly incapable of saying a word.\nHereupon, the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him,\ndeserted him at once to a man, and were even more clamorous than his\nancient and avowed enemies for his instantaneous arrest. But, on the\nother hand, the magnanimity of Mr. Goodfellow shone forth with only the\nmore brilliant lustre through contrast. He made a warm and intensely\neloquent defence of Mr. Pennifeather, in which he alluded more than once\nto his own sincere forgiveness of that wild young gentleman--“the heir\nof the worthy Mr. Shuttleworthy,”--for the insult which he (the young\ngentleman) had, no doubt in the heat of passion, thought proper to put\nupon him (Mr. Goodfellow). “He forgave him for it,” he said, “from the\nvery bottom of his heart; and for himself (Mr. Goodfellow), so far from\npushing the suspicious circumstances to extremity, which he was sorry\nto say, really had arisen against Mr. Pennifeather, he (Mr. Goodfellow)\nwould make every exertion in his power, would employ all the little\neloquence in his possession to--to--to--soften down, as much as he could\nconscientiously do so, the worst features of this really exceedingly\nperplexing piece of business.”\n\nMr. Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain,\nvery much to the credit both of his head and of his heart; but your\nwarm-hearted people are seldom apposite in their observations--they run\ninto all sorts of blunders, contre-temps and mal apropos-isms, in the\nhot-headedness of their zeal to serve a friend--thus, often with the\nkindest intentions in the world, doing infinitely more to prejudice his\ncause than to advance it.\n\nSo, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of\n“Old Charley”; for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the\nsuspected, yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he\nuttered of which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the\nspeaker in the good opinion of his audience, had the effect to deepen\nthe suspicion already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded,\nand to arouse against him the fury of the mob.\n\nOne of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his\nallusion to the suspected as “the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr.\nShuttleworthy.” The people had really never thought of this before. They\nhad only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year\nor two previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the\nnephew), and they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance\nas a matter that was settled--so single-minded a race of beings were the\nRattleburghers; but the remark of “Old Charley” brought them at once to\na consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the possibility\nof the threats having been nothing more than a threat. And straightway\nhereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?--a question that\ntended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible crime upon\nthe young man. And here, lest I may be misunderstood, permit me to\ndigress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and\nsimple Latin phrase which I have employed, is invariably mistranslated\nand misconceived. “Cui bono?” in all the crack novels and elsewhere,--in\nthose of Mrs. Gore, for example, (the author of “Cecil,”) a lady who\nquotes all tongues from the Chaldaean to Chickasaw, and is helped to her\nlearning, “as needed,” upon a systematic plan, by Mr. Beckford,--in all\nthe crack novels, I say, from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of\nBulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth, the two little\nLatin words cui bono are rendered “to what purpose?” or, (as if quo\nbono,) “to what good.” Their true meaning, nevertheless, is “for whose\nadvantage.” Cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit. It is a purely\nlegal phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now\nunder consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges\nupon the probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to\nthat from the deed’s accomplishment. Now in the present instance, the\nquestion cui bono? very pointedly implicated Mr. Pennifeather. His\nuncle had threatened him, after making a will in his favour, with\ndisinheritance. But the threat had not been actually kept; the original\nwill, it appeared, had not been altered. Had it been altered, the only\nsupposable motive for murder on the part of the suspected would\nhave been the ordinary one of revenge; and even this would have been\ncounteracted by the hope of reinstation into the good graces of the\nuncle. But the will being unaltered, while the threat to alter remained\nsuspended over the nephew’s head, there appears at once the very\nstrongest possible inducement for the atrocity, and so concluded, very\nsagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle.\n\nMr. Pennifeather was, accordingly, arrested upon the spot, and the\ncrowd, after some further search, proceeded homeward, having him in\ncustody. On the route, however, another circumstance occurred tending to\nconfirm the suspicion entertained. Mr. Goodfellow, whose zeal led him\nto be always a little in advance of the party, was seen suddenly to run\nforward a few paces, stoop, and then apparently to pick up some small\nobject from the grass. Having quickly examined it he was observed, too,\nto make a sort of half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket; but\nthis action was noticed, as I say, and consequently prevented, when the\nobject picked up was found to be a Spanish knife which a dozen persons\nat once recognized as belonging to Mr. Pennifeather. Moreover, his\ninitials were engraved upon the handle. The blade of this knife was open\nand bloody.\n\nNo doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew, and immediately upon\nreaching Rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination.\n\nHere matters again took a most unfavourable turn. The prisoner, being\nquestioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s\ndisappearance, had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on\nthat very morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking, in the\nimmediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat\nhad been discovered through the sagacity of Mr. Goodfellow.\n\nThis latter now came forward, and, with tears in his eyes, asked\npermission to be examined. He said that a stern sense of the duty he\nowed his Maker, not less than his fellow-men, would permit him no longer\nto remain silent. Hitherto, the sincerest affection for the young man\n(notwithstanding the latter’s ill-treatment of himself, Mr. Goodfellow)\nhad induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could\nsuggest, by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious\nin the circumstances that told so seriously against Mr. Pennifeather,\nbut these circumstances were now altogether too convincing--too damning,\nhe would hesitate no longer--he would tell all he knew, although his\nheart (Mr. Goodfellow’s) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort.\nHe then went on to state that, on the afternoon of the day previous to\nMr. Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city, that worthy old gentleman\nhad mentioned to his nephew, in his hearing (Mr. Goodfellow’s), that\nhis object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an\nunusually large sum of money in the “Farmers and Mechanics’ Bank,” and\nthat, then and there, the said Mr. Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed\nto the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the\nwill originally made, and of cutting him off with a shilling. He (the\nwitness) now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what\nhe (the witness) had just stated was or was not the truth in every\nsubstantial particular. Much to the astonishment of every one present,\nMr. Pennifeather frankly admitted that it was.\n\nThe magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables\nto search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle. From\nthis search they almost immediately returned with the well-known\nsteel-bound, russet leather pocket-book which the old gentleman had been\nin the habit of carrying for years. Its valuable contents, however, had\nbeen abstracted, and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from\nthe prisoner the use which had been made of them, or the place of their\nconcealment. Indeed, he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter.\nThe constables, also, discovered, between the bed and sacking of the\nunhappy man, a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials\nof his name, and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim.\n\nAt this juncture, it was announced that the horse of the murdered man\nhad just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had\nreceived, and it was proposed by Mr. Goodfellow that a post mortem\nexamination of the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if\npossible, of discovering the ball. This was accordingly done; and, as\nif to demonstrate beyond a question the guilt of the accused, Mr.\nGoodfellow, after considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was\nenabled to detect and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size,\nwhich, upon trial, was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr.\nPennifeather’s rifle, while it was far too large for that of any other\nperson in the borough or its vicinity. To render the matter even surer\nyet, however, this bullet was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right\nangles to the usual suture, and upon examination, this seam corresponded\nprecisely with an accidental ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds\nacknowledged by the accused himself to be his own property. Upon finding\nof this bullet, the examining magistrate refused to listen to\nany farther testimony, and immediately committed the prisoner for\ntrial-declining resolutely to take any bail in the case, although\nagainst this severity Mr. Goodfellow very warmly remonstrated, and\noffered to become surety in whatever amount might be required. This\ngenerosity on the part of “Old Charley” was only in accordance with the\nwhole tenour of his amiable and chivalrous conduct during the entire\nperiod of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle. In the present instance\nthe worthy man was so entirely carried away by the excessive warmth of\nhis sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten, when he offered to\ngo bail for his young friend, that he himself (Mr. Goodfellow) did not\npossess a single dollar’s worth of property upon the face of the earth.\n\nThe result of the committal may be readily foreseen. Mr. Pennifeather,\namid the loud execrations of all Rattleborough, was brought to trial at\nthe next criminal sessions, when the chain of circumstantial evidence\n(strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts, which Mr.\nGoodfellow’s sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from\nthe court) was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive, that\nthe jury, without leaving their seats, returned an immediate verdict\nof “Guilty of murder in the first degree.” Soon afterward the unhappy\nwretch received sentence of death, and was remanded to the county jail\nto await the inexorable vengeance of the law.\n\nIn the meantime, the noble behavior of “Old Charley Goodfellow,” had\ndoubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough. He became\nten times a greater favorite than ever, and, as a natural result of the\nhospitality with which he was treated, he relaxed, as it were, perforce,\nthe extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto\nimpelled him to observe, and very frequently had little reunions at his\nown house, when wit and jollity reigned supreme-dampened a little, of\ncourse, by the occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy\nfate which impended over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of\nthe generous host.\n\nOne fine day, this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at\nthe receipt of the following letter:-\n\n Charles Goodfellow, Esq., Rattleborough\n From H.F.B. & Co.\n Chat. Mar. A--No. 1.--6 doz. bottles (1/2 Gross)\n\n “Charles Goodfellow, Esquire.\n\n “Dear Sir--In conformity with an order transmitted to our firm about\n two months since, by our esteemed correspondent, Mr. Barnabus\n Shuttleworthy, we have the honor of forwarding this morning, to your\n address, a double box of Chateau-Margaux of the antelope brand, violet\n seal. Box numbered and marked as per margin.\n\n “We remain, sir,\n         “Your most ob’nt ser’ts,\n                 “HOGGS, FROGS, BOGS, & CO.\n\n “City of--, June 21, 18--.\n\n “P.S.--The box will reach you by wagon, on the day after your receipt\n of this letter. Our respects to Mr. Shuttleworthy.\n\n                  “H., F., B., & CO.”\n\nThe fact is, that Mr. Goodfellow had, since the death of Mr.\nShuttleworthy, given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised\nChateau-Margaux; and he, therefore, looked upon it now as a sort\nof especial dispensation of Providence in his behalf. He was highly\ndelighted, of course, and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large\nparty of friends to a petit souper on the morrow, for the purpose of\nbroaching the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy’s present. Not that he said\nany thing about “the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy” when he issued the\ninvitations. The fact is, he thought much and concluded to say nothing\nat all. He did not mention to any one--if I remember aright--that he had\nreceived a present of Chateau-Margaux. He merely asked his friends to\ncome and help him drink some, of a remarkable fine quality and rich\nflavour, that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago,\nand of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow. I have often\npuzzled myself to imagine why it was that “Old Charley” came to the\nconclusion to say nothing about having received the wine from his\nold friend, but I could never precisely understand his reason for the\nsilence, although he had some excellent and very magnanimous reason, no\ndoubt.\n\nThe morrow at length arrived, and with it a very large and highly\nrespectable company at Mr. Goodfellow’s house. Indeed, half the borough\nwas there,--I myself among the number,--but, much to the vexation of the\nhost, the Chateau-Margaux did not arrive until a late hour, and when\nthe sumptuous supper supplied by “Old Charley” had been done very ample\njustice by the guests. It came at length, however,--a monstrously big\nbox of it there was, too--and as the whole party were in excessively\ngood humor, it was decided, nem. con., that it should be lifted upon the\ntable and its contents disembowelled forthwith.\n\nNo sooner said than done. I lent a helping hand; and, in a trice we had\nthe box upon the table, in the midst of all the bottles and glasses, not\na few of which were demolished in the scuffle. “Old Charley,” who was\npretty much intoxicated, and excessively red in the face, now took a\nseat, with an air of mock dignity, at the head of the board, and thumped\nfuriously upon it with a decanter, calling upon the company to keep\norder “during the ceremony of disinterring the treasure.”\n\nAfter some vociferation, quiet was at length fully restored, and, as\nvery often happens in similar cases, a profound and remarkable silence\nensued. Being then requested to force open the lid, I complied, of\ncourse, “with an infinite deal of pleasure.” I inserted a chisel, and\ngiving it a few slight taps with a hammer, the top of the box flew\nsuddenly off, and at the same instant, there sprang up into a sitting\nposition, directly facing the host, the bruised, bloody, and nearly\nputrid corpse of the murdered Mr. Shuttleworthy himself. It gazed for a\nfew seconds, fixedly and sorrowfully, with its decaying and lack-lustre\neyes, full into the countenance of Mr. Goodfellow; uttered slowly,\nbut clearly and impressively, the words--“Thou art the man!” and then,\nfalling over the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied, stretched\nout its limbs quiveringly upon the table.\n\nThe scene that ensued is altogether beyond description. The rush for the\ndoors and windows was terrific, and many of the most robust men in the\nroom fainted outright through sheer horror. But after the first wild,\nshrieking burst of affright, all eyes were directed to Mr. Goodfellow.\nIf I live a thousand years, I can never forget the more than mortal\nagony which was depicted in that ghastly face of his, so lately rubicund\nwith triumph and wine. For several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue\nof marble; his eyes seeming, in the intense vacancy of their gaze, to\nbe turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable,\nmurderous soul. At length their expression appeared to flash suddenly\nout into the external world, when, with a quick leap, he sprang from his\nchair, and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table,\nand in contact with the corpse, poured out rapidly and vehemently a\ndetailed confession of the hideous crime for which Mr. Pennifeather was\nthen imprisoned and doomed to die.\n\nWhat he recounted was in substance this:--He followed his victim to the\nvicinity of the pool; there shot his horse with a pistol; despatched\nits rider with the butt end; possessed himself of the pocket-book, and,\nsupposing the horse dead, dragged it with great labour to the\nbrambles by the pond. Upon his own beast he slung the corpse of Mr.\nShuttleworthy, and thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long\ndistance off through the woods.\n\nThe waistcoat, the knife, the pocket-book, and bullet, had been placed\nby himself where found, with the view of avenging himself upon Mr.\nPennifeather. He had also contrived the discovery of the stained\nhandkerchief and shirt.\n\nTowards the end of the blood-churning recital the words of the guilty\nwretch faltered and grew hollow. When the record was finally exhausted,\nhe arose, staggered backward from the table, and fell-dead.\n\n                   *****\n\nThe means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted, although\nefficient, were simple indeed. Mr. Goodfellow’s excess of frankness had\ndisgusted me, and excited my suspicions from the first. I was present\nwhen Mr. Pennifeather had struck him, and the fiendish expression which\nthen arose upon his countenance, although momentary, assured me that his\nthreat of vengeance would, if possible, be rigidly fulfilled. I was thus\nprepared to view the manoeuvering of “Old Charley” in a very different\nlight from that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of\nRattleborough. I saw at once that all the criminating discoveries arose,\neither directly or indirectly, from himself. But the fact which clearly\nopened my eyes to the true state of the case, was the affair of\nthe bullet, found by Mr. G. in the carcass of the horse. I had not\nforgotten, although the Rattleburghers had, that there was a hole where\nthe ball had entered the horse, and another where it went out. If it\nwere found in the animal then, after having made its exit, I saw clearly\nthat it must have been deposited by the person who found it. The bloody\nshirt and handkerchief confirmed the idea suggested by the bullet; for\nthe blood on examination proved to be capital claret, and no more.\nWhen I came to think of these things, and also of the late increase of\nliberality and expenditure on the part of Mr. Goodfellow, I entertained\na suspicion which was none the less strong because I kept it altogether\nto myself.\n\nIn the meantime, I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse\nof Mr. Shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as\ndivergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his\nparty. The result was that, after some days, I came across an old dry\nwell, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the\nbottom, I discovered what I sought.\n\nNow it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two\ncronies, when Mr. Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the\npromise of a box of Chateaux-Margaux. Upon this hint I acted. I procured\na stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse,\nand deposited the latter in an old wine box-taking care so to double\nthe body up as to double the whalebone with it. In this manner I had\nto press forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with\nnails; and I anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were\nremoved, the top would fly off and the body up.\n\nHaving thus arranged the box, I marked, numbered, and addressed it\nas already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine\nmerchants with whom Mr. Shuttleworthy dealt, I gave instructions to my\nservant to wheel the box to Mr. Goodfellow’s door, in a barrow, at a\ngiven signal from myself. For the words which I intended the corpse to\nspeak, I confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities; for their\neffect, I counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch.\n\nI believe there is nothing more to be explained. Mr. Pennifeather was\nreleased upon the spot, inherited the fortune of his uncle, profited by\nthe lessons of experience, turned over a new leaf, and led happily ever\nafterward a new life.\n\n","\nI've never been a fan of Mother's Day or Father's Day. Everyone knows they are just a scam for the Greeting Card companies to make money. Yet my mother always thrusts guilt upon me if I don't get her a card and a nice little present to go with it. I know, I sound like a rotten son for saying it, but I get the card and the gifts solely that I do not feel the 'guilt' that goes otherwise. You see me and my parents do not see eye to eye on many issues, our indifferences causing a huge rift in our relationship with each other. One of many such indifferences which led me to experiencing the trip report I am writing about now. Don't get me wrong, I do love my parents dearly, but sometimes their overbearing love for me becomes a bit too much, and a little bit of escapism is needed. This was one of those nights, escapism inside the Mini Noodle.\n\nI won't go into much detail of what set off our usual bickering, basically it was at a family reunion in which I was accused of not spending enough time with the relatives. I tried defending myself, Mom got a little too worked up about it and brought up other degrading insults into the mix. I grew silent and endured the heated drive back home, where upon returning, I swiftly left in my car to get away. I went to a friend's place where a few of my buddies were lounging, smoking weed and drinking Coronas.\n\nThe laid back environment calmed me down significantly, and soon I forgot all about that afternoon, smoking a few bowls and watching a movie on Satellite t.v. My friends were good company, but unfortunately I am the only night owl in the group. I was able to keep my friends conscious until about 2 am, when they all agreed it was late and parted ways.\n\nI was still unwilling to go back home just yet, so I searched for another thing to do. I then remembered my connect and good friend 'T,' would be off work around 3:30. If I could just kill time until then, I could meet up with him and then sample some more of his latest supply inside the Mini Noodle.\n\nThe Mini Noodle was my sanctuary, a place to kick back and forget about the real world when the going got tough. It simply was an old shed placed out in my friend's backyard which was retrofitted with couches, blacklights and a cheap stereo. It was designed to resemble a chillout room from a rave where me and my friends could unwind and do our drugs. We could get fairly noisy out there and the neighbors wouldn't complain. My friend's neighbors had their own reasons for not wanting to attract the cops. Besides, it wasn't like we were out there every night anyway.\n\nThe chillroom was built so that we could throw a couple of our own mini-raves at the residence, but for the most part, it was still just a shed that held couches and some various paraphanelia, as well as some tagged glow in the dark paint on the walls. It got its name, the 'Mini Noodle,' through the rave venue where I had first met my friends. The Noodle Factory it was called, nestled around a few ghetto parts of West Oakland.\n\nI remembered helping my friends paint the shed when it was getting its new look, and the paint job resembled part of one of the rooms inside the Noodle Factory, which happened to be as cramped and hot as the shed we were painting. One of us pointed this fact out, and we lovingly christened its name, ironically, through our displeasure of partying at the stuffy Noodle Factory. I loved the Mini Noodle, it was my home away from home. Even when the mini-raves stopped happening, I would usually be out there at least once a weekend, smoking a bowl, huffing nitrous, listening to some music or popping a pill. I put that place to good use, and intended to do so again tonight.\n\nI managed spending the next hour and a half driving around aimlessly through town, getting food to eat and loitering outside a few places. I found my friend T outside the Sports Bar he worked at, picked him up and headed to my other friend's place that housed the Mini Noodle. He was my friend's brother, and was living with him at the time, so he was basically getting a free ride home. I asked if he had anymore of the stuff in his possession. He said yes. I smiled. Now for most people, unwinding with a smoke and a few beers would be enough. For me, I felt a little change was in order. I needed something new on the menu, and this time, Ecstacy and Ketamine were the special combo of the day.\n\nI still had a green music note leftover from a party two months ago. I had only done K once, and that was a few days ago when T had given me a free sample after scoring some from a rave he went too last week. It was nothing like I had ever tried before. This time, I wanted to see what K and E could do together. After all, it wasn't like Ketamine was easy to find in this town, so now that it was available, I might as well do some experimenting. T had done that combination before, but wasn't too impressed with it. But he was curious to see what it would do to me. So was I.\n\nI popped the green music note at 4. I normally wouldn't drop so late at night, but these circumstances called for it. I've had an experience with green music notes before. They wouldn't start working til an hour and a half after consumption, the longest I've ever waited for a pill to hit. But once they hit, they worked well, and would leave off some visuals once you came down.\n\nNaturally I wanted to wait an hour and a half before doing a bag of K, so that both drugs would be working in synch. After all, it only takes about 10 minutes for the disassociative effects of K to kick in, and lasts for about an hour. Yes, I had researched the drug fairly well, and timed the duration on my cell phone when I did it a few nights ago. So me and T chilled inside the Mini Noodle, all blacklights turned on, passing the bong back and forth smoking some mediocre weed and talking about parties past.\n\nAt 40 minutes past T could not wait any longer. He pulled out a small red baggie and a cut straw and snorted up the premeasured 100 mg of ketamine hydrochloride inside. He sighed in delight and passed another bag and the straw to me, but I refused. My roll wasn't kicking in yet, I was only stoned and tired, but I was also growing anxious. Just my luck to be left with one pill that took so ridiculously long to hit. T laughed and played some Happy Hardcore. Not my type of music to listen too when taking a disassociative/psychedelic, I much prefer progressive house or psytrance during a trip, but it seemed to make T feel much more at home. I wasn't going to argue this time. I loved happy hardcore when I was rolling anyway, and hopefully I will be rolling soon.\n\n50 minutes past and still nothing but baked thoughts and a slight urge to dance. I had still been talking to T about various things, but the last question he answered, he seemed to get stuck, and stared at me for a few minutes before laughing. I could tell the K was getting hold of him, and I wanted to stay somewhere around his level. So when he offered me the bag and straw the second time around, I took it willingly.\n\nI emptied the bag at 4:50 with just a few strong whiffs, feeling like a disco stud. K goes up the nostrils so much smoother than cocaine. There's no numbness, no breathing out of only one nostril, just a slight tingle to it and it's gone. I poked my finger in the bag, gathered a few more particles and rubbed it on my gums. There was no significance to it, I was only being silly. It got a few more disjointed laughs from T.\n\n5 minutes later he gets up, and wobbles over to the couch to lie down. I say wobble, because walking becomes difficult once K works its magic. It's much better to lie down anyway, because having to stand can become quite distracting from the trip. At 5 am I found myself getting stuck as well. Basically it's just looking around the room and having my vision stop at one random place for a few minutes before I realize I've been staring at nothing for...how long? It becomes difficult telling time too. I could now feel the room slowly start to tilt from side to side, as if a giant was outside the Mini Noodle, rocking the place back and forth.\n\nI get up out of my chair and wave my arms in the air, struggling for balance. My spinal cord refuses to snap upright, so I wobble over to my couch, hunchbacked. I glance over to my right and T is already K'ed out, rocking out to the cheesy riffs of the hardcore. I drop on my couch like dead weight, rocking my head back and forth, becoming amazed at how heavy it feels. And there we lie, on our respective couches, for the next 40 minutes. I check my cellphone here and there to check the time, but soon the LED panel becomes too bright for me to read the display. So I lie there doing nothing, zoning in and out and having scattered thoughts that I forget about a few minutes after.\n\nAt 5:30 T gets up to change cd's with another happy hardcore album. He seems to be fairly sober now, and takes another rip out of the bong once the new cd plays. I'm coming out of my K trip as well, with nothing remarkable to really remember, much to my disappointment. Just as I thought, I had taken the K too early, and now I started to feel my jaw tighten up and the familiar MDMA-induced feelings tingle around my mind and body. Life can be so cruel sometimes, or can it? I turn to look at T with a slight smirk on my face, and ask him, 'Want to go halves on another bag?' T never hesitated.\n\n5:35 am, me and T take in another 50 mg (roughly) of our beloved substance. Neither one of us had fully comedown off the first bump yet, so there would still be some K running in our system as the 2nd bump came in. Before I lose my ability to walk again, I cache out what was left in the bong then promptly return to my seat. The E was coming on quite nicely, but the jaw clench was slightly distracting. If only I had some gum to chew. There was a half-full bottle of Aquafina on the table, so I drink some of that to keep myself hydrated.\n\n10 minutes later I'm wobbling back over to the couch Notre Dame style, this time noticing a difference in the intensity of the influence. My body had become dead weight again, but this time I had much more feeling. I could feel the individual hairs on my arms nestle around, and the itchy fabric of the couch had become softer, I could now feel all the different fibers rest around my skin. How strange it was, to feel all your muscles in your body become 10 times heavier, and yet have elevated feelings in touch.\n\n20 minutes after the 2nd K bump go by, and I can feel my body start to sweat a little. I try pulling my cell phone out to look at the time again, and I see that my phone had bent in an arc to the right. I now had to tilt my head to read the display, and even then my mind couldn't make sense of what it read. It looked familiar, but distant, unimportant. I throw the phone somewhere on the couch and run my fingers through my hair. Oh God, did it feel good, even though my hair felt more like a cheap wig, it still felt good to touch it.\n\nI look up at the ceiling, and all the normal pock marks and scratches are slowly moving forward. It became more like a conveyor belt than a ceiling, as the dents and marks would move forward, then disappear somehow, and come back to its original place, moving forward again. Soon the dents and marks began forming shapes of their own, moving on this upside down conveyor belt. I began to feel like Alice, plummeting down the rabbit hole, and as soon as I thought that, behold! A half visible face of the Cheshire Cat appeared to me, running along the conveyor belt. And as soon as I gasped in surprise, Cheshire grinned at me, before disappearing. Oh my God, it was happening. I was tripping out!\n\nI soon took my focus out of the conveyor belt ceiling, and looked around all the tagged, glow in the dark art covering the walls. It was all mostly neon green, but I saw that the letters were taking on a Life of their own. They were becoming 3-D. They could bend and twist around. They could stretch and shrink. They wanted to move, and this time the natural laws of the Earth couldn't stop them. The dancing letters became pleasant to look at, and I could feel my eyes rolling back in their sockets as the letters darted back and forth across the walls.\n\nThey started moving across the walls and floor so quickly that soon I became convinced that I was stuck inside the Matrix and could see all the green code scrolling by. It was a lightshow like no other, and I was loving it. Here and there I would try to grab one of the letters as they passed by, but my arms would not work right. It kept feeling like they would grow out 20 feet in length, and then I would have a hard time trying to ravel it back to its original length, much like winding up a garden hose. It was too weird of a feeling so I dropped them back on the couch in defeat.\n\nI looked back up at the ceiling to marvel at the Matrix code, but it had disappeared. The letters had gone back to their original places, but they looked foreign, I could still not understand what they read. I saw a little black speck walk across one of the letters, it looked like a small spider. As soon as I thought that, a giant glimmering silver web filled across my vision, and to my surprise, a silky strand of webbing had attached itself on every object in the room, including me. Seeing as I hate spiders, I did what I could to remove the strand of webbing off of myself, as hard as that was to do.\n\nAs soon as it left me, I felt a cold shock run through my body, as if I had been cut off from something vital. I began wondering if perhaps that what I saw was the Web of Life, and everything alive was attached to it, and to be cut off from it could only mean death. No that doesn't make sense. I am tripping, that is all. The air condensed all around me. The light bounced off the air in strange ways, making the air appear solid. What kind of solid reflects light in that way? Glass. Oh no, the air has turned into glass! I am suffocating! I could no longer breathe. All I could feel were sharp pieces of glass ripping into my lungs.\n\nHow could this have happened? There is no glass, you are tripping. Somehow, as chemically altered as my senses were, there was still this tiny, sane voice in my mind, reminding me of what I had taken. As soon as I remembered that I had taken K, the air became normal again. But as poor as my short term memory was that night, I would forget the voice, and start seeing things again.\n\nThe happy hardcore still playing in the background now sounded like it was slowed down, like it had become trance instead. The layers of sound in the tracks were no longer in synch, and so parts of the song would sound off. One lyric sprung into my mind, 'Jump onto your feet,' That sounded like a good idea. But how did one, jump onto their feet? That required movement of some sort right? Movement that I could no longer make. I still wanted to dance to the music, but I couldn't figure how to go about that anymore. Perhaps, if gravity offered a little assistance.\n\nAnd that's when the world tilted. I felt suddenly as if the couch had attached its bottom end onto the left wall and there was all this gravity that was now pushing on my left side, wanting me to fall on the floor, and yet somehow there I remained, glued onto the couch which was now glued onto the wall. And from there, fabrics began appearing everywhere. Various multi-patterned fabrics, as if they had been ripped from some larger material and were now being draped and layered together in random places.\n\nSoon the fabrics were everywhere, polka dots, stripes, labrynth shapes, and others in various degrees of opacity, forming a huge fabric montage in front of my very eyes. I didn't know what the Hell was going on anymore. And when it looked like I would now be suffocated from pounds of fabrics thrown on my body, everything went back to normal. The couch was back on the floor, the glow in the dark art was understandable once again, everything was back in its place. I must have blacked out.\n\nThe hardcore cd had ended and T seemed to have fallen asleep. I still felt very much cracked out and tired, and my jaw ached. I searched around the couch and find my phone. The display read 7:14 am. Wow, it was already morning. I was too tired to drive home, and too cracked out to sleep, so I laid there on the couch, for another hour, thinking of the things I had just experienced. Gradually I'm able to sleep again.\n\nAfter that night I decided to stay away from the Special K for a little while. I had read about its psychedelic effects, and after trying acid and shrooms, I knew I wanted to give this drug a shot. It did not disappoint, it was so radically different from the other psychedelics, it still amazes me to recall the things I saw inside the Mini Noodle that night. Not that I could discern any enlightenment from it, but an interesting experience nonetheless. Just one of many late nights, in the Mini Noodle. Oh yes, and I did get around to giving my mom her gift and card for Mother's Day. Business as usual. \n\n","Orh ok then tp lor.haha.","'I shall never forget Tony's face.  'Twas a little, round, firm, tight\nface, with a seam here and there left by the smallpox, but not enough to\nhurt his looks in a woman's eye, though he'd had it badish when he was a\nboy.  So very serious looking and unsmiling 'a was, that young man, that\nit really seemed as if he couldn't laugh at all without great pain to his\nconscience.  He looked very hard at a small speck in your eye when\ntalking to 'ee.  And there was no more sign of a whisker or beard on Tony\nKytes's face than on the palm of my hand.  He used to sing \"The Tailor's\nBreeches\" with a religious manner, as if it were a hymn:--\n\n'\"O the petticoats went off, and the breeches they went on!\"\n\nand all the rest of the scandalous stuff.  He was quite the women's\nfavourite, and in return for their likings he loved 'em in shoals.\n\n'But in course of time Tony got fixed down to one in particular, Milly\nRichards, a nice, light, small, tender little thing; and it was soon said\nthat they were engaged to be married.  One Saturday he had been to market\nto do business for his father, and was driving home the waggon in the\nafternoon.  When he reached the foot of the very hill we shall be going\nover in ten minutes who should he see waiting for him at the top but\nUnity Sallet, a handsome girl, one of the young women he'd been very\ntender toward before he'd got engaged to Milly.\n\n'As soon as Tony came up to her she said, \"My dear Tony, will you give me\na lift home?\"\n\n'\"That I will, darling,\" said Tony.  \"You don't suppose I could refuse\n'ee?\"\n\n'She smiled a smile, and up she hopped, and on drove Tony.\n\n'\"Tony,\" she says, in a sort of tender chide, \"why did ye desert me for\nthat other one?  In what is she better than I?  I should have made 'ee a\nfiner wife, and a more loving one too.  'Tisn't girls that are so easily\nwon at first that are the best.  Think how long we've known each\nother--ever since we were children almost--now haven't we, Tony?\"\n\n'\"Yes, that we have,\" says Tony, a-struck with the truth o't.\n\n'\"And you've never seen anything in me to complain of, have ye, Tony?  Now\ntell the truth to me?\"\n\n'\"I never have, upon my life,\" says Tony.\n\n'\"And--can you say I'm not pretty, Tony?  Now look at me!\"\n\n'He let his eyes light upon her for a long while.  \"I really can't,\" says\nhe.  \"In fact, I never knowed you was so pretty before!\"\n\n'\"Prettier than she?\"\n\n'What Tony would have said to that nobody knows, for before he could\nspeak, what should he see ahead, over the hedge past the turning, but a\nfeather he knew well--the feather in Milly's hat--she to whom he had been\nthinking of putting the question as to giving out the banns that very\nweek.\n\n'\"Unity,\" says he, as mild as he could, \"here's Milly coming.  Now I\nshall catch it mightily if she sees 'ee riding here with me; and if you\nget down she'll be turning the corner in a moment, and, seeing 'ee in the\nroad, she'll know we've been coming on together.  Now, dearest Unity,\nwill ye, to avoid all unpleasantness, which I know ye can't bear any more\nthan I, will ye lie down in the back part of the waggon, and let me cover\nyou over with the tarpaulin till Milly has passed?  It will all be done\nin a minute.  Do!--and I'll think over what we've said; and perhaps I\nshall put a loving question to you after all, instead of to Milly.\n'Tisn't true that it is all settled between her and me.\"\n\n'Well, Unity Sallet agreed, and lay down at the back end of the waggon,\nand Tony covered her over, so that the waggon seemed to be empty but for\nthe loose tarpaulin; and then he drove on to meet Milly.\n\n'\"My dear Tony!\" cries Milly, looking up with a little pout at him as he\ncame near.  \"How long you've been coming home!  Just as if I didn't live\nat Upper Longpuddle at all!  And I've come to meet you as you asked me to\ndo, and to ride back with you, and talk over our future home--since you\nasked me, and I promised.  But I shouldn't have come else, Mr. Tony!\"\n\n'\"Ay, my dear, I did ask ye--to be sure I did, now I think of it--but I\nhad quite forgot it.  To ride back with me, did you say, dear Milly?\"\n\n'\"Well, of course!  What can I do else?  Surely you don't want me to\nwalk, now I've come all this way?\"\n\n'\"O no, no!  I was thinking you might be going on to town to meet your\nmother.  I saw her there--and she looked as if she might be expecting\n'ee.\"\n\n'\"O no; she's just home.  She came across the fields, and so got back\nbefore you.\"\n\n'\"Ah!  I didn't know that,\" says Tony.  And there was no help for it but\nto take her up beside him.\n\n'They talked on very pleasantly, and looked at the trees, and beasts, and\nbirds, and insects, and at the ploughmen at work in the fields, till\npresently who should they see looking out of the upper window of a house\nthat stood beside the road they were following, but Hannah Jolliver,\nanother young beauty of the place at that time, and the very first woman\nthat Tony had fallen in love with--before Milly and before Unity, in\nfact--the one that he had almost arranged to marry instead of Milly.  She\nwas a much more dashing girl than Milly Richards, though he'd not thought\nmuch of her of late.  The house Hannah was looking from was her aunt's.\n\n'\"My dear Milly--my coming wife, as I may call 'ee,\" says Tony in his\nmodest way, and not so loud that Unity could overhear, \"I see a young\nwoman alooking out of window, who I think may accost me.  The fact is,\nMilly, she had a notion that I was wishing to marry her, and since she's\ndiscovered I've promised another, and a prettier than she, I'm rather\nafeard of her temper if she sees us together.  Now, Milly, would you do\nme a favour--my coming wife, as I may say?\"\n\n'\"Certainly, dearest Tony,\" says she.\n\n'\"Then would ye creep under the empty sacks just here in the front of the\nwaggon, and hide there out of sight till we've passed the house?  She\nhasn't seen us yet.  You see, we ought to live in peace and good-will\nsince 'tis almost Christmas, and 'twill prevent angry passions rising,\nwhich we always should do.\"\n\n'\"I don't mind, to oblige you, Tony,\" Milly said; and though she didn't\ncare much about doing it, she crept under, and crouched down just behind\nthe seat, Unity being snug at the other end.  So they drove on till they\ngot near the road-side cottage.  Hannah had soon seen him coming, and\nwaited at the window, looking down upon him.  She tossed her head a\nlittle disdainful and smiled off-hand.\n\n'\"Well, aren't you going to be civil enough to ask me to ride home with\nyou!\" she says, seeing that he was for driving past with a nod and a\nsmile.\n\n'\"Ah, to be sure!  What was I thinking of?\" said Tony, in a flutter.  \"But\nyou seem as if you was staying at your aunt's?\"\n\n'\"No, I am not,\" she said.  \"Don't you see I have my bonnet and jacket\non?  I have only called to see her on my way home.  How can you be so\nstupid, Tony?\"\n\n'\"In that case--ah--of course you must come along wi' me,\" says Tony,\nfeeling a dim sort of sweat rising up inside his clothes.  And he reined\nin the horse, and waited till she'd come downstairs, and then helped her\nup beside him.  He drove on again, his face as long as a face that was a\nround one by nature well could be.\n\n'Hannah looked round sideways into his eyes.  \"This is nice, isn't it,\nTony?\" she says.  \"I like riding with you.\"\n\n'Tony looked back into her eyes.  \"And I with you,\" he said after a\nwhile.  In short, having considered her, he warmed up, and the more he\nlooked at her the more he liked her, till he couldn't for the life of him\nthink why he had ever said a word about marriage to Milly or Unity while\nHannah Jolliver was in question.  So they sat a little closer and closer,\ntheir feet upon the foot-board and their shoulders touching, and Tony\nthought over and over again how handsome Hannah was.  He spoke tenderer\nand tenderer, and called her \"dear Hannah\" in a whisper at last.\n\n'\"You've settled it with Milly by this time, I suppose,\" said she.\n\n'\"N-no, not exactly.\"\n\n'\"What?  How low you talk, Tony.\"\n\n'\"Yes--I've a kind of hoarseness.  I said, not exactly.\"\n\n'\"I suppose you mean to?\"\n\n'\"Well, as to that--\"  His eyes rested on her face, and hers on his.  He\nwondered how he could have been such a fool as not to follow up Hannah.\n\"My sweet Hannah!\" he bursts out, taking her hand, not being really able\nto help it, and forgetting Milly and Unity, and all the world besides.\n\"Settled it?  I don't think I have!\"\n\n'\"Hark!\" says Hannah.\n\n'\"What?\" says Tony, letting go her hand.\n\n'\"Surely I heard a sort of little screaming squeak under those sacks?\nWhy, you've been carrying corn, and there's mice in this waggon, I\ndeclare!\"  She began to haul up the tails of her gown.\n\n'\"Oh no; 'tis the axle,\" said Tony in an assuring way.  \"It do go like\nthat sometimes in dry weather.\"\n\n'\"Perhaps it was . . . Well, now, to be quite honest, dear Tony, do you\nlike her better than me?  Because--because, although I've held off so\nindependent, I'll own at last that I do like 'ee, Tony, to tell the\ntruth; and I wouldn't say no if you asked me--you know what.\"\n\n'Tony was so won over by this pretty offering mood of a girl who had been\nquite the reverse (Hannah had a backward way with her at times, if you\ncan mind) that he just glanced behind, and then whispered very soft, \"I\nhaven't quite promised her, and I think I can get out of it, and ask you\nthat question you speak of.\"\n\n'\"Throw over Milly?--all to marry me!  How delightful!\" broke out Hannah,\nquite loud, clapping her hands.\n\n'At this there was a real squeak--an angry, spiteful squeak, and\nafterward a long moan, as if something had broke its heart, and a\nmovement of the empty sacks.\n\n'\"Something's there!\" said Hannah, starting up.\n\n'\"It's nothing, really,\" says Tony in a soothing voice, and praying\ninwardly for a way out of this.  \"I wouldn't tell 'ee at first, because I\nwouldn't frighten 'ee.  But, Hannah, I've really a couple of ferrets in a\nbag under there, for rabbiting, and they quarrel sometimes.  I don't wish\nit knowed, as 'twould be called poaching.  Oh, they can't get out, bless\nye--you are quite safe!  And--and--what a fine day it is, isn't it,\nHannah, for this time of year?  Be you going to market next Saturday?  How\nis your aunt now?\"  And so on, says Tony, to keep her from talking any\nmore about love in Milly's hearing.\n\n'But he found his work cut out for him, and wondering again how he should\nget out of this ticklish business, he looked about for a chance.  Nearing\nhome he saw his father in a field not far off, holding up his hand as if\nhe wished to speak to Tony.\n\n'\"Would you mind taking the reins a moment, Hannah,\" he said, much\nrelieved, \"while I go and find out what father wants?\"\n\n'She consented, and away he hastened into the field, only too glad to get\nbreathing time.  He found that his father was looking at him with rather\na stern eye.\n\n'\"Come, come, Tony,\" says old Mr. Kytes, as soon as his son was alongside\nhim, \"this won't do, you know.\"\n\n'\"What?\" says Tony.\n\n'\"Why, if you mean to marry Milly Richards, do it, and there's an end\no't.  But don't go driving about the country with Jolliver's daughter and\nmaking a scandal.  I won't have such things done.\"\n\n'\"I only asked her--that is, she asked me, to ride home.\"\n\n'\"She?  Why, now, if it had been Milly, 'twould have been quite proper;\nbut you and Hannah Jolliver going about by yourselves--\"\n\n'\"Milly's there too, father.\"\n\n'\"Milly?  Where?\"\n\n'\"Under the corn-sacks!  Yes, the truth is, father, I've got rather into\na nunny-watch, I'm afeard!  Unity Sallet is there too--yes, at the other\nend, under the tarpaulin.  All three are in that waggon, and what to do\nwith 'em I know no more than the dead!  The best plan is, as I'm\nthinking, to speak out loud and plain to one of 'em before the rest, and\nthat will settle it; not but what 'twill cause 'em to kick up a bit of a\nmiff, for certain.  Now which would you marry, father, if you was in my\nplace?\"\n\n'\"Whichever of 'em did _not_ ask to ride with thee.\"\n\n'\"That was Milly, I'm bound to say, as she only mounted by my invitation.\nBut Milly--\"\n\n\"Then stick to Milly, she's the best . . . But look at that!\"\n\n'His father pointed toward the waggon.  \"She can't hold that horse in.\nYou shouldn't have left the reins in her hands.  Run on and take the\nhorse's head, or there'll be some accident to them maids!\"\n\n'Tony's horse, in fact, in spite of Hannah's tugging at the reins, had\nstarted on his way at a brisk walking pace, being very anxious to get\nback to the stable, for he had had a long day out.  Without another word\nTony rushed away from his father to overtake the horse.\n\n'Now of all things that could have happened to wean him from Milly there\nwas nothing so powerful as his father's recommending her.  No; it could\nnot be Milly, after all.  Hannah must be the one, since he could not\nmarry all three.  This he thought while running after the waggon.  But\nqueer things were happening inside it.\n\n'It was, of course, Milly who had screamed under the sack-bags, being\nobliged to let off her bitter rage and shame in that way at what Tony was\nsaying, and never daring to show, for very pride and dread o' being\nlaughed at, that she was in hiding.  She became more and more restless,\nand in twisting herself about, what did she see but another woman's foot\nand white stocking close to her head.  It quite frightened her, not\nknowing that Unity Sallet was in the waggon likewise.  But after the\nfright was over she determined to get to the bottom of all this, and she\ncrept and crept along the bed of the waggon, under the tarpaulin, like a\nsnake, when lo and behold she came face to face with Unity.\n\n'\"Well, if this isn't disgraceful!\" says Milly in a raging whisper to\nUnity.\n\n'\"'Tis,\" says Unity, \"to see you hiding in a young man's waggon like\nthis, and no great character belonging to either of ye!\"\n\n'\"Mind what you are saying!\" replied Milly, getting louder.  \"I am\nengaged to be married to him, and haven't I a right to be here?  What\nright have you, I should like to know?  What has he been promising you?  A\npretty lot of nonsense, I expect!  But what Tony says to other women is\nall mere wind, and no concern to me!\"\n\n'\"Don't you be too sure!\" says Unity.  \"He's going to have Hannah, and\nnot you, nor me either; I could hear that.\"\n\n'Now at these strange voices sounding from under the cloth Hannah was\nthunderstruck a'most into a swound; and it was just at this time that the\nhorse moved on.  Hannah tugged away wildly, not knowing what she was\ndoing; and as the quarrel rose louder and louder Hannah got so horrified\nthat she let go the reins altogether.  The horse went on at his own pace,\nand coming to the corner where we turn round to drop down the hill to\nLower Longpuddle he turned too quick, the off wheels went up the bank,\nthe waggon rose sideways till it was quite on edge upon the near axles,\nand out rolled the three maidens into the road in a heap.\n\n'When Tony came up, frightened and breathless, he was relieved enough to\nsee that neither of his darlings was hurt, beyond a few scratches from\nthe brambles of the hedge.  But he was rather alarmed when he heard how\nthey were going on at one another.\n\n'\"Don't ye quarrel, my dears--don't ye!\" says he, taking off his hat out\nof respect to 'em.  And then he would have kissed them all round, as fair\nand square as a man could, but they were in too much of a taking to let\nhim, and screeched and sobbed till they was quite spent.\n\n'\"Now I'll speak out honest, because I ought to,\" says Tony, as soon as\nhe could get heard.  \"And this is the truth,\" says he.  \"I've asked\nHannah to be mine, and she is willing, and we are going to put up the\nbanns next--\"\n\n'Tony had not noticed that Hannah's father was coming up behind, nor had\nhe noticed that Hannah's face was beginning to bleed from the scratch of\na bramble.  Hannah had seen her father, and had run to him, crying worse\nthan ever.\n\n'\"My daughter is _not_ willing, sir!\" says Mr. Jolliver hot and strong.\n\"Be you willing, Hannah?  I ask ye to have spirit enough to refuse him,\nif yer virtue is left to 'ee and you run no risk?\"\n\n'\"She's as sound as a bell for me, that I'll swear!\" says Tony, flaring\nup.  \"And so's the others, come to that, though you may think it an\nonusual thing in me!\"\n\n'\"I have spirit, and I do refuse him!\" says Hannah, partly because her\nfather was there, and partly, too, in a tantrum because of the discovery,\nand the scratch on her face.  \"Little did I think when I was so soft with\nhim just now that I was talking to such a false deceiver!\"\n\n'\"What, you won't have me, Hannah?\" says Tony, his jaw hanging down like\na dead man's.\n\n'\"Never--I would sooner marry no--nobody at all!\" she gasped out, though\nwith her heart in her throat, for she would not have refused Tony if he\nhad asked her quietly, and her father had not been there, and her face\nhad not been scratched by the bramble.  And having said that, away she\nwalked upon her father's arm, thinking and hoping he would ask her again.\n\n'Tony didn't know what to say next.  Milly was sobbing her heart out; but\nas his father had strongly recommended her he couldn't feel inclined that\nway.  So he turned to Unity.\n\n'\"Well, will you, Unity dear, be mine?\" he says.\n\n'\"Take her leavings?  Not I!\" says Unity.  \"I'd scorn it!\"  And away\nwalks Unity Sallet likewise, though she looked back when she'd gone some\nway, to see if he was following her.\n\n'So there at last were left Milly and Tony by themselves, she crying in\nwatery streams, and Tony looking like a tree struck by lightning.\n\n'\"Well, Milly,\" he says at last, going up to her, \"it do seem as if fate\nhad ordained that it should be you and I, or nobody.  And what must be\nmust be, I suppose.  Hey, Milly?\"\n\n'\"If you like, Tony.  You didn't really mean what you said to them?\"\n\n'\"Not a word of it!\" declares Tony, bringing down his fist upon his palm.\n\n'And then he kissed her, and put the waggon to rights, and they mounted\ntogether; and their banns were put up the very next Sunday.  I was not\nable to go to their wedding, but it was a rare party they had, by all\naccount.  Everybody in Longpuddle was there almost; you among the rest, I\nthink, Mr. Flaxton?'  The speaker turned to the parish clerk.\n\n'I was,' said Mr. Flaxton.  'And that party was the cause of a very\ncurious change in some other people's affairs; I mean in Steve Hardcome's\nand his cousin James's.'\n\n'Ah! the Hardcomes,' said the stranger.  'How familiar that name is to\nme!  What of them?'\n\nThe clerk cleared his throat and began:--\n\n\nTHE HISTORY OF THE HARDCOMES\n\n\n'Yes, Tony's was the very best wedding-randy that ever I was at; and I've\nbeen at a good many, as you may suppose'--turning to the newly-arrived\none--'having as a church-officer, the privilege to attend all\nchristening, wedding, and funeral parties--such being our Wessex custom.\n\n''Twas on a frosty night in Christmas week, and among the folk invited\nwere the said Hardcomes o' Climmerston--Steve and James--first cousins,\nboth of them small farmers, just entering into business on their own\naccount.  With them came, as a matter of course, their intended wives,\ntwo young women of the neighbourhood, both very pretty and sprightly\nmaidens, and numbers of friends from Abbot's-Cernel, and Weatherbury, and\nMellstock, and I don't know where--a regular houseful.\n\n'The kitchen was cleared of furniture for dancing, and the old folk\nplayed at \"Put\" and \"All-fours\" in the parlour, though at last they gave\nthat up to join in the dance.  The top of the figure was by the large\nfront window of the room, and there were so many couples that the lower\npart of the figure reached through the door at the back, and into the\ndarkness of the out-house; in fact, you couldn't see the end of the row\nat all, and 'twas never known exactly how long that dance was, the lowest\ncouples being lost among the faggots and brushwood in the out-house.\n\n'When we had danced a few hours, and the crowns of we taller men were\nswelling into lumps with bumping the beams of the ceiling, the first\nfiddler laid down his fiddle-bow, and said he should play no more, for he\nwished to dance.  And in another hour the second fiddler laid down his,\nand said he wanted to dance too; so there was only the third fiddler\nleft, and he was a' old, veteran man, very weak in the wrist.  However,\nhe managed to keep up a faltering tweedle-dee; but there being no chair\nin the room, and his knees being as weak as his wrists, he was obliged to\nsit upon as much of the little corner-table as projected beyond the\ncorner-cupboard fixed over it, which was not a very wide seat for a man\nadvanced in years.\n\n'Among those who danced most continually were the two engaged couples, as\nwas natural to their situation.  Each pair was very well matched, and\nvery unlike the other.  James Hardcome's intended was called Emily Darth,\nand both she and James were gentle, nice-minded, in-door people, fond of\na quiet life.  Steve and his chosen, named Olive Pawle, were different;\nthey were of a more bustling nature, fond of racketing about and seeing\nwhat was going on in the world.  The two couples had arranged to get\nmarried on the same day, and that not long thence; Tony's wedding being a\nsort of stimulant, as is often the case; I've noticed it professionally\nmany times.\n\n'They danced with such a will as only young people in that stage of\ncourtship can dance; and it happened that as the evening wore on James\nhad for his partner Stephen's plighted one, Olive, at the same time that\nStephen was dancing with James's Emily.  It was noticed that in spite o'\nthe exchange the young men seemed to enjoy the dance no less than before.\nBy and by they were treading another tune in the same changed order as we\nhad noticed earlier, and though at first each one had held the other's\nmistress strictly at half-arm's length, lest there should be shown any\nobjection to too close quarters by the lady's proper man, as time passed\nthere was a little more closeness between 'em; and presently a little\nmore closeness still.\n\n'The later it got the more did each of the two cousins dance with the\nwrong young girl, and the tighter did he hold her to his side as he\nwhirled her round; and, what was very remarkable, neither seemed to mind\nwhat the other was doing.  The party began to draw towards its end, and I\nsaw no more that night, being one of the first to leave, on account of my\nmorning's business.  But I learnt the rest of it from those that knew.\n\n'After finishing a particularly warming dance with the changed partners,\nas I've mentioned, the two young men looked at one another, and in a\nmoment or two went out into the porch together.\n\n'\"James,\" says Steve, \"what were you thinking of when you were dancing\nwith my Olive?\"\n\n'\"Well,\" said James, \"perhaps what you were thinking of when you were\ndancing with my Emily.\"\n\n'\"I was thinking,\" said Steve, with some hesitation, \"that I wouldn't\nmind changing for good and all!\"\n\n'\"It was what I was feeling likewise,\" said James.\n\n'\"I willingly agree to it, if you think we could manage it.\"\n\n'\"So do I.  But what would the girls say?\"\n\n'\"'Tis my belief,\" said Steve, \"that they wouldn't particularly object.\nYour Emily clung as close to me as if she already belonged to me, dear\ngirl.\"\n\n'\"And your Olive to me,\" says James.  \"I could feel her heart beating\nlike a clock.\"\n\n'Well, they agreed to put it to the girls when they were all four walking\nhome together.  And they did so.  When they parted that night the\nexchange was decided on--all having been done under the hot excitement of\nthat evening's dancing.  Thus it happened that on the following Sunday\nmorning, when the people were sitting in church with mouths wide open to\nhear the names published as they had expected, there was no small\namazement to hear them coupled the wrong way, as it seemed.  The\ncongregation whispered, and thought the parson had made a mistake; till\nthey discovered that his reading of the names was verily the true way.  As\nthey had decided, so they were married, each one to the other's original\nproperty.\n\n'Well, the two couples lived on for a year or two ordinarily enough, till\nthe time came when these young people began to grow a little less warm to\ntheir respective spouses, as is the rule of married life; and the two\ncousins wondered more and more in their hearts what had made 'em so mad\nat the last moment to marry crosswise as they did, when they might have\nmarried straight, as was planned by nature, and as they had fallen in\nlove.  'Twas Tony's party that had done _it_, plain enough, and they half\nwished they had never gone there.  James, being a quiet, fireside,\nperusing man, felt at times a wide gap between himself and Olive, his\nwife, who loved riding and driving and out-door jaunts to a degree;\nwhile Steve, who was always knocking about hither and thither, had a very\ndomestic wife, who worked samplers, and made hearthrugs, scarcely ever\nwished to cross the threshold, and only drove out with him to please him.\n\n'However, they said very little about this mismating to any of their\nacquaintances, though sometimes Steve would look at James's wife and\nsigh, and James would look at Steve's wife and do the same.  Indeed, at\nlast the two men were frank enough towards each other not to mind\nmentioning it quietly to themselves, in a long-faced, sorry-smiling,\nwhimsical sort of way, and would shake their heads together over their\nfoolishness in upsetting a well-considered choice on the strength of an\nhour's fancy in the whirl and wildness of a dance.  Still, they were\nsensible and honest young fellows enough, and did their best to make\nshift with their lot as they had arranged it, and not to repine at what\ncould not now be altered or mended.\n\n'So things remained till one fine summer day they went for their yearly\nlittle outing together, as they had made it their custom to do for a long\nwhile past.  This year they chose Budmouth-Regis as the place to spend\ntheir holiday in; and off they went in their best clothes at nine o'clock\nin the morning.\n\n'When they had reached Budmouth-Regis they walked two and two along the\nshore--their new boots going squeakity-squash upon the clammy velvet\nsands.  I can seem to see 'em now!  Then they looked at the ships in the\nharbour; and then went up to the Look-out; and then had dinner at an inn;\nand then again walked two and two, squeakity-squash, upon the velvet\nsands.  As evening drew on they sat on one of the public seats upon the\nEsplanade, and listened to the band; and then they said \"What shall we do\nnext?\"\n\n'\"Of all things,\" said Olive (Mrs. James Hardcome, that is), \"I should\nlike to row in the bay!  We could listen to the music from the water as\nwell as from here, and have the fun of rowing besides.\"\n\n'\"The very thing; so should I,\" says Stephen, his tastes being always\nlike hers.\n\nHere the clerk turned to the curate.\n\n'But you, sir, know the rest of the strange particulars of that strange\nevening of their lives better than anybody else, having had much of it\nfrom their own lips, which I had not; and perhaps you'll oblige the\ngentleman?'\n\n'Certainly, if it is wished,' said the curate.  And he took up the\nclerk's tale:--\n\n* * * * *\n\n'Stephen's wife hated the sea, except from land, and couldn't bear the\nthought of going into a boat.  James, too, disliked the water, and said\nthat for his part he would much sooner stay on and listen to the band in\nthe seat they occupied, though he did not wish to stand in his wife's way\nif she desired a row.  The end of the discussion was that James and his\ncousin's wife Emily agreed to remain where they were sitting and enjoy\nthe music, while they watched the other two hire a boat just beneath, and\ntake their water-excursion of half an hour or so, till they should choose\nto come back and join the sitters on the Esplanade; when they would all\nstart homeward together.\n\n'Nothing could have pleased the other two restless ones better than this\narrangement; and Emily and James watched them go down to the boatman\nbelow and choose one of the little yellow skiffs, and walk carefully out\nupon the little plank that was laid on trestles to enable them to get\nalongside the craft.  They saw Stephen hand Olive in, and take his seat\nfacing her; when they were settled they waved their hands to the couple\nwatching them, and then Stephen took the pair of sculls and pulled off to\nthe tune beat by the band, she steering through the other boats skimming\nabout, for the sea was as smooth as glass that evening, and\npleasure-seekers were rowing everywhere.\n\n'\"How pretty they look moving on, don't they?\" said Emily to James (as\nI've been assured).  \"They both enjoy it equally.  In everything their\nlikings are the same.\"\n\n'\"That's true,\" said James.\n\n'\"They would have made a handsome pair if they had married,\" said she.\n\n'\"Yes,\" said he.  \"'Tis a pity we should have parted 'em\"\n\n'\"Don't talk of that, James,\" said she.  \"For better or for worse we\ndecided to do as we did, and there's an end of it.\"\n\n'They sat on after that without speaking, side by side, and the band\nplayed as before; the people strolled up and down; and Stephen and Olive\nshrank smaller and smaller as they shot straight out to sea.  The two on\nshore used to relate how they saw Stephen stop rowing a moment, and take\noff his coat to get at his work better; but James's wife sat quite still\nin the stern, holding the tiller-ropes by which she steered the boat.\nWhen they had got very small indeed she turned her head to shore.\n\n'\"She is waving her handkerchief to us,\" said Stephen's wife, who\nthereupon pulled out her own, and waved it as a return signal.\n\n'The boat's course had been a little awry while Mrs. James neglected her\nsteering to wave her handkerchief to her husband and Mrs. Stephen; but\nnow the light skiff went straight onward again, and they could soon see\nnothing more of the two figures it contained than Olive's light mantle\nand Stephen's white shirt sleeves behind.\n\n'The two on the shore talked on.  \"'Twas very curious--our changing\npartners at Tony Kytes's wedding,\" Emily declared.  \"Tony was of a fickle\nnature by all account, and it really seemed as if his character had\ninfected us that night.  Which of you two was it that first proposed not\nto marry as we were engaged?\"\n\n'\"H'm--I can't remember at this moment,\" says James.  \"We talked it over,\nyou know; and no sooner said than done.\"\n\n'\"'Twas the dancing,\" said she.  \"People get quite crazy sometimes in a\ndance.\"\n\n'\"They do,\" he owned.\n\n'\"James--do you think they care for one another still?\" asks Mrs.\nStephen.\n\n'James Hardcome mused and admitted that perhaps a little tender feeling\nmight flicker up in their hearts for a moment now and then.  \"Still,\nnothing of any account,\" he said.\n\n'\"I sometimes think that Olive is in Steve's mind a good deal,\" murmurs\nMrs. Stephen; \"particularly when she pleases his fancy by riding past our\nwindow at a gallop on one of the draught-horses . . . I never could do\nanything of that sort; I could never get over my fear of a horse.\"\n\n'\"And I am no horseman, though I pretend to be on her account,\" murmured\nJames Hardcome.  \"But isn't it almost time for them to turn and sweep\nround to the shore, as the other boating folk have done?  I wonder what\nOlive means by steering away straight to the horizon like that?  She has\nhardly swerved from a direct line seaward since they started.\"\n\n'\"No doubt they are talking, and don't think of where they are going,\"\nsuggests Stephen's wife.\n\n'\"Perhaps so,\" said James.  \"I didn't know Steve could row like that.\"\n\n'\"O yes,\" says she.  \"He often comes here on business, and generally has\na pull round the bay.\"\n\n'\"I can hardly see the boat or them,\" says James again; \"and it is\ngetting dark.\"\n\n'The heedless pair afloat now formed a mere speck in the films of the\ncoming night, which thickened apace, till it completely swallowed up\ntheir distant shapes.  They had disappeared while still following the\nsame straight course away from the world of land-livers, as if they were\nintending to drop over the sea-edge into space, and never return to earth\nagain.\n\n'The two on the shore continued to sit on, punctually abiding by their\nagreement to remain on the same spot till the others returned.  The\nEsplanade lamps were lit one by one, the bandsmen folded up their stands\nand departed, the yachts in the bay hung out their riding lights, and the\nlittle boats came back to shore one after another, their hirers walking\non to the sands by the plank they had climbed to go afloat; but among\nthese Stephen and Olive did not appear.\n\n'\"What a time they are!\" said Emily.  \"I am getting quite chilly.  I did\nnot expect to have to sit so long in the evening air.\"\n\n'Thereupon James Hardcome said that he did not require his overcoat, and\ninsisted on lending it to her.\n\n'He wrapped it round Emily's shoulders.\n\n'\"Thank you, James,\" she said.  \"How cold Olive must be in that thin\njacket!\"\n\n'He said he was thinking so too.  \"Well, they are sure to be quite close\nat hand by this time, though we can't see 'em.  The boats are not all in\nyet.  Some of the rowers are fond of paddling along the shore to finish\nout their hour of hiring.\"\n\n'\"Shall we walk by the edge of the water,\" said she, \"to see if we can\ndiscover them?\"\n\n'He assented, reminding her that they must not lose sight of the seat,\nlest the belated pair should return and miss them, and be vexed that they\nhad not kept the appointment.\n\n'They walked a sentry beat up and down the sands immediately opposite the\nseat; and still the others did not come.  James Hardcome at last went to\nthe boatman, thinking that after all his wife and cousin might have come\nin under shadow of the dusk without being perceived, and might have\nforgotten the appointment at the bench.\n\n'\"All in?\" asked James.\n\n'\"All but one boat,\" said the lessor.  \"I can't think where that couple\nis keeping to.  They might run foul of something or other in the dark.\"\n\n'Again Stephen's wife and Olive's husband waited, with more and more\nanxiety.  But no little yellow boat returned.  Was it possible they could\nhave landed further down the Esplanade?\n\n'\"It may have been done to escape paying,\" said the boat-owner.  \"But\nthey didn't look like people who would do that.\"\n\n'James Hardcome knew that he could found no hope on such a reason as\nthat.  But now, remembering what had been casually discussed between\nSteve and himself about their wives from time to time, he admitted for\nthe first time the possibility that their old tenderness had been revived\nby their face-to-face position more strongly than either had anticipated\nat starting--the excursion having been so obviously undertaken for the\npleasure of the performance only,--and that they had landed at some steps\nhe knew of further down toward the pier, to be longer alone together.\n\n'Still he disliked to harbour the thought, and would not mention its\nexistence to his companion.  He merely said to her, \"Let us walk further\non.\"\n\n'They did so, and lingered between the boat-stage and the pier till\nStephen Hardcome's wife was uneasy, and was obliged to accept James's\noffered arm.  Thus the night advanced.  Emily was presently so worn out\nby fatigue that James felt it necessary to conduct her home; there was,\ntoo, a remote chance that the truants had landed in the harbour on the\nother side of the town, or elsewhere, and hastened home in some\nunexpected way, in the belief that their consorts would not have waited\nso long.\n\n'However, he left a direction in the town that a lookout should be kept,\nthough this was arranged privately, the bare possibility of an elopement\nbeing enough to make him reticent; and, full of misgivings, the two\nremaining ones hastened to catch the last train out of Budmouth-Regis;\nand when they got to Casterbridge drove back to Upper Longpuddle.'\n\n'Along this very road as we do now,' remarked the parish clerk.\n\n'To be sure--along this very road,' said the curate.  'However, Stephen\nand Olive were not at their homes; neither had entered the village since\nleaving it in the morning.  Emily and James Hardcome went to their\nrespective dwellings to snatch a hasty night's rest, and at daylight the\nnext morning they drove again to Casterbridge and entered the Budmouth\ntrain, the line being just opened.\n\n'Nothing had been heard of the couple there during this brief absence.  In\nthe course of a few hours some young men testified to having seen such a\nman and woman rowing in a frail hired craft, the head of the boat kept\nstraight to sea; they had sat looking in each other's faces as if they\nwere in a dream, with no consciousness of what they were doing, or\nwhither they were steering.  It was not till late that day that more\ntidings reached James's ears.  The boat had been found drifting bottom\nupward a long way from land.  In the evening the sea rose somewhat, and a\ncry spread through the town that two bodies were cast ashore in Lullstead\nBay, several miles to the eastward.  They were brought to Budmouth, and\ninspection revealed them to be the missing pair.  It was said that they\nhad been found tightly locked in each other's arms, his lips upon hers,\ntheir features still wrapt in the same calm and dream-like repose which\nhad been observed in their demeanour as they had glided along.\n\n'Neither James nor Emily questioned the original motives of the\nunfortunate man and woman in putting to sea.  They were both above\nsuspicion as to intention.  Whatever their mutual feelings might have led\nthem on to, underhand behaviour was foreign to the nature of either.\nConjecture pictured that they might have fallen into tender reverie while\ngazing each into a pair of eyes that had formerly flashed for him and her\nalone, and, unwilling to avow what their mutual sentiments were, they had\ncontinued thus, oblivious of time and space, till darkness suddenly\novertook them far from land.  But nothing was truly known.  It had been\ntheir destiny to die thus.  The two halves, intended by Nature to make\nthe perfect whole, had failed in that result during their lives, though\n\"in their death they were not divided.\"  Their bodies were brought home,\nand buried on one day.  I remember that, on looking round the churchyard\nwhile reading the service, I observed nearly all the parish at their\nfuneral.'\n\n'It was so, sir,' said the clerk.\n\n'The remaining two,' continued the curate (whose voice had grown husky\nwhile relating the lovers' sad fate), 'were a more thoughtful and far-\nseeing, though less romantic, couple than the first.  They were now\nmutually bereft of a companion, and found themselves by this accident in\na position to fulfil their destiny according to Nature's plan and their\nown original and calmly-formed intention.  James Hardcome took Emily to\nwife in the course of a year and a half; and the marriage proved in every\nrespect a happy one.  I solemnized the service, Hardcome having told me,\nwhen he came to give notice of the proposed wedding, the story of his\nfirst wife's loss almost word for word as I have told it to you.'\n\n'And are they living in Longpuddle still?' asked the new-comer.\n\n'O no, sir,' interposed the clerk.  'James has been dead these dozen\nyears, and his mis'ess about six or seven.  They had no children.  William\nPrivett used to be their odd man till he died.'\n\n'Ah--William Privett!  He dead too?--dear me!' said the other.  'All\npassed away!'\n\n'Yes, sir.  William was much older than I.  He'd ha' been over eighty if\nhe had lived till now.'\n\n'There was something very strange about William's death--very strange\nindeed!' sighed a melancholy man in the back of the van.  It was the\nseedsman's father, who had hitherto kept silence.\n\n'And what might that have been?' asked Mr. Lackland.\n\n","If I needed someone to love\nYou're the one that I'd be thinking of\nIf I needed someone\n\nIf I had some more time to spend\nThen I guess I'd be with you my friend\nIf I needed someone\nHad you come some other day\nThen it might not have been like this\nBut you see now I'm too much in love\n\nCarve your number on my wall\nAnd maybe you will get a call from me\nIf I needed someone\nAh, ah, ah, ah\n\nIf I had some more time to spend\nThen I guess I'd be with you my friend\nIf I needed someone\nHad you come some other day\nThen it might not have been like this\nBut you see now I'm too much in love\n\nCarve your number on my wall\nAnd maybe you will get a call from me\nIf I needed someone\n\n","Loving you isn't the right thing to do.\nHow can I ever change things that I feel.\n\nIf I could, maybe I'd give you my world.\nHow can I, when you won't take it from me.\n\nYou can go your own way.\nGo your own way.\nYou can call it another lonely day.\nYou can go your own way.\n\nTell me why everything turned around.\nPacking up, shacking up is all you want to do.\n\nIf I could, baby I'd give you my world.\nOpen up, everything's waiting for you.\n\n","\nI had done speed and smoked a lot of weed before trying LSD; in fact I'd always been scared to try LSD although I didn't understand anything about it. All the stories I had heard where about great experiences. Unfortunately for me, my first and only trip turned out to be the worst experience of my life.\n\nIt all started at my friends house, there was about 4 or 5 of us and I thought we was originally going to smoke some weed and just have a few beers but some guy my friend knew from the army pulled out some LSD. I can't remember what they where other than he said they where purple homs - double dipped, whatever that meant. I guess they dip the tab wait for it to dry then its dipped again.\n\nI didn't want to take it, but I thought I'd look like a whimp if I didn't, I guess today I'd rather of dealt with being called a whimp than have to deal with what I went through.\n\nI dropped it; about 30 minutes later I felt the initial sensation that I was reserved inside myself. I guess you could call it a feeling of defensiveness. My sensory perception was the first to go, along with feelings of paranoia. I was sitting in a chair facing all my other friends and I remember thinking the music was too loud, so I got up to turn the music down. My friends where looking at me a little weird. After I sat back down, I remember thinking, the music is too quiet, so I got back up and turned the music back up. Then again I thought now its too loud and got back up and turned it back down. This went on for quite a while, then I realized, oh no, is this was the trip has done to me?\n\nI was kind of stuck in a loop repeating my actions of getting up and down. Something was in my mind telling me stuff, I thought I have to ignore whatever my mind is telling me to beat this thing, whatever it was. I thought to myself, this trip is going to be some kind of test and I have to beat it.\n\nOf course after realizing that this was not going to be fun, I started to panic. But inwardly I thought, oh well I better try and handle it. I remember the feelings of paranoia, I could hear every little sensational noise, I noticed my friend had a copy of murder casebook on the floor, and I started to think about maybe they where after me or where conspiring against me. I could hear the neighbors kids screaming which all added to the paranoia of seeing a book on serial killers on my friends floor.\n\nI thought I have to get this out my system so I went to the bathroom and put my fingers down my throat all to none affect. I remember my friend coming up to me and asking me if the trip had kicked in yet and I said, 'yes'. I didn't really care at the time only that I had made a big mistake and there was nothing I could do about it. The sensations started to come and go about once every 10 minutes, I knew when it was going to happen and I tried to fight it. But eventually I couldn't control it.\n\nI thought my only chance is to go to sleep and sleep it off, I walked down my friends hallway into the bedroom at the end and I climbed into bed. I remember lying down and thinking I have to fall asleep. Of course I couldn't. So I got back up and started to walk back down the hallway towards the living room. When I got closer to the hallway, I kind of blinked and I ended up back outside the bedroom door. I thought what the heck, I just walked down there and how did I end up back here. I walked down the hallway again and I got to the living room and same thing, I blinked my eyes and I was back outside the bedroom door. I tried it again and again, and same thing every time I got closer to the living room I would blink and be back by the bedroom door.\n\nI remember a very distinct thought saying to me, 'This is hell, your are stuck in this hallway now for eternity'. The thought was the devil, I said to myself. I got very scared within myself. After a while this wore off, I got into the living room. I think I tried to tell my friend what just happened but they where all busy boasting about their little trips and their last thing that just happened to them. I sat down in the living room in the same chair and my friend said he was going out to take the dog for a walk. 2 other of my friends said they was going to go with him. So I said to them, 'Oh I'll go with you guys'. They responded very abruptly, 'No you won't you have to stay here'. I guess I must have been tripping more than them and they knew it. Of course within my own little trip world I started to get paranoid, why didn't they want me to go, they are conspiring to do something, maybe even kill me. So I thought to myself I have to get out of here quick and get home.\n\nOf course this was going to be a difficult task as I lived about 6 miles from my home. I ran down the hallway into my friend's bedroom and ran to the window. I opened the window as wide as it would go and jumped out the window. Luckily for me my friend lived on the ground floor of a bungalow style house. I remember just thinking to myself I have to get the heck out of here. I ran across this wooded area up towards a bridge where the main bus route went down. I climbed up the small embankment to the side of the bridge and onto the main road. I started to run up the road wanting to get home to my family and away from these people.\n\nI could feel my heart starting to beat faster and faster (I assume because I was running so fast). I started to hear voices telling me I was going to die and that this was my end. I started to hear an ambulance siren coming towards me. I remember stopping running and thinking, 'Oh know I'm going to have a heart attack and die'. I remember the fear very distinctly and the fear of death and not wanting to die like this. But then the ambulance went past where I was, it was a mere coincidence that at the time I was tripping and was running that an ambulance happened to race by, or was it even there at all I wondered. I realized it was a part of the trip after all. I continued to run up the road, I must have run a good mile to the next crossroads. For some reason I stopped heading for the direction of home and I crossed the street and stood behind this barred fence with railings. As I was standing there, I remember this semi-truck coming towards me, I thought oh God he's coming right for me, so I ran the opposite direction.\n\nI reached a work development where there were a lot of factories and I turned down into their development, I remember walking and seeing soccer ground with floodlights on the ground, so I climbed over the fence onto the grounds. I remember walking across the field looking up into the lights, thinking it was some spectacular mystery. I put my hands in my pocket and pulled out my money and threw it all in the air, then I took my watch of and threw it also, then my house keys. I then took my sweatshirt off and threw it in the air. I was now walking round with no money, no keys to get in my house and no top on.\n\nI remember falling into the grass. The grass was about 6 feet tall and that I was getting smaller and smaller. I could hear a stream of water starting to run around me and I then appeared to be in the water looking from a different perspective. I remember distinct thoughts saying to me that I was a molecule or some kind of cellular structure just floating around in a stream; I was some kind of stream creature.\n\nI don't remember much after this other than I must have blacked out. I came to about 3 to 4 hours later and thought where the heck am I. I started to have memories of seeing some old man with white hair at this mansion and I was talking to him. I wasn't tripping no more but I was having these memories of what had happened, I thought I was either dreaming or was having flashbacks. I remember a voice telling me I was the luckiest, greediest man in the world, I have no idea who was telling me this and why. I thought to myself at first that I must of died and that maybe this man had sent me back to earth because my time was not yet, and that this memory was from the place I had just came back from. My head was so messed up, I couldn't think right.\n\nI started to think how the heck am I going to get back to my friends house. I started to walk back out of the development and I saw 2 security guards driving past. They drove up to me; of course I was walking with no shirt on so they knew something was wrong. Right away they asked me if I was ok and had I been taking drugs. I told them I was ok and I knew where I was. They told me that they had seen me wondering around the development a few hours ago.\n\nThey drove me to their security hut and called the police. I remember hearing the police on the speakerphone. The security guy told the police that I had been taking drugs and was wondering around the development. The police asked the security guy if I was ok now and did I know where was, I told them yes, as I didn't want the police to come out, because if they took me home my mom would know I had taken drugs. So I told them, yes I knew where I was. The police said they wouldn't bother coming out then. After that I told the security guy that I lost my shirt and keys etc.\n\nI told him I threw it on the field, he just looked at me like I was crazy. I guess I was. Anyway he went and found my sweatshirt but couldn't find my money or keys. They let me go then. So I walked up the road thinking where the heck am I. I saw a taxi cab and flagged him down. I asked him did he know the name of my friend's road and he said yes, it was about a mile away. So I got in and he took me to my friends. By this time it was 6am in the morning. I had taken the LSD around 12 midnight. I think I actually blacked out for at least 4 hours. My friends afterwards told me they had been searching for me for about 4 hours around the streets.\n\nI tried to tell them what had happened but I couldn't remember much. My friend gave me a change of clothes and I went home like nothing had happened. To this day my family doesn't know what I did that night. I never took LSD ever again in fact any other drug or weed again.\n\nI few weeks later, I went to the same friends house and he was smoking weed, I went in and sat down. My friend asked me if I wanted a cup of tea. So I said yes. I started drinking the tea and all of a sudden I looked at the tea and a voice said to me, they have dropped LSD in your tea. I started to freak out and cuss at my friend saying, 'You have spiked my tea, what the heck'. He just looked at me like I was crazy. I said to my other friend, 'Lets get out of here', and I left. I never went back to his house again after that. This was my first inclination that I had some permanent damage due to the LSD a few weeks before.\n\nThis whole account of what happened that night could not compare to what really happened. The fear, the paranoia and the schizophrenic thoughts constantly bombarding my mind with harassment and propaganda. I would tell anyone even thinking of taking LSD to reconsider. I never thought this would affect me the way it has. I was no different to my friends in personality, but why it affected me different I don't know. My friends never did explain to me after what they experienced even to this day. All of us kind of drifted apart over the years.\n\nThis was not the end by no means. About 7 years ago, this was years after I had given up drinking and smoking weed etc. I was working out regular and was running a few times a week. I was running my daily routine of about a mile and a half of a fast run and I got to the end of my run and was approaching a hill, I remember feeling my heart beat real fast. All of a sudden, bam, I was having flashbacks of the time I was running in my trip and heard the ambulance. I was getting thoughts of I was going to die and have a heart attack.\n\nI stopped running and walked home the rest of the way. I went home and went upstairs and cried bitterly. I thought to myself this stuff has destroyed my mind. I started to panic and started to have a bad panic attack. I could hear thoughts of what I thought was the devil telling me I was going die and that he was going to get me and that I was going to hell. I was crying and didn't know what to do. I could feel this heaviness on my back like something was on me, a force, a bad spirit whatever you want to call it. After this I kneeled down by my bed and prayed to God to take it away.\n\nEventually after that experience I became a Christian and gave my life to God. I have suffered panic attacks since but on a milder scale also the thoughts constantly bombarding me sometimes don't stop, my mind is constantly racing around, I'm constantly thinking non stop about everything. I question everything and find it hard to trust people. I still get fear and dread sometimes out of nowhere. Also not long after this I was at college and went through a bad panic attack while walking through the college hallway. I started to think I was in some kind of hell corridor and that I was trapped in this corridor amongst all this evil. I walked out really quick. Also another time when I got on a bus I was walking down the bus to go sit on the back seat and all the faces on the bus where looking at me, I started going real paranoid and started to have flash backs. I thought the bus was in hell and all the people where demons and they where at any second going to jump up and grab me like a crazy zombie movie. I freaked out and got off the bus. I walked 2 ' miles to my friends because I couldn't get back on the bus.\n\nI have learnt to live with it over the years but in effect it died down a lot, I try and keep myself stress free as to not bring on any kind of flash back. LSD has affected me on a permanent level. I hope this convinces at least one person to not take LSD.\n\n","\nTHE _symposium_ of the preceding evening had been a little too much\nfor my nerves. I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy.\nInstead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed,\nit occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a\nmouthful of supper and go immediately to bed.\n\nA light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit. More\nthan a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable. Still,\nthere can be no material objection to two. And really between two and\nthree, there is merely a single unit of difference. I ventured, perhaps,\nupon four. My wife will have it five;--but, clearly, she has confounded\ntwo very distinct affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to\nadmit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout,\nwithout which, in the way of condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.\n\nHaving thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the\nserene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon\nthe pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a\nprofound slumber forthwith.\n\nBut when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? I could not have\ncompleted my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the\nstreet-door bell, and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which\nawakened me at once. In a minute afterward, and while I was still\nrubbing my eyes, my wife thrust in my face a note, from my old friend,\nDoctor Ponnonner. It ran thus:\n\n      “Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you\n receive this. Come and help us to rejoice. At last, by long persevering\n diplomacy, I have gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum,\n to my examination of the Mummy--you know the one I mean. I have\n permission to unswathe it and open it, if desirable. A few friends only\n will be present--you, of course. The Mummy is now at my house, and we\n shall begin to unroll it at eleven to-night.\n\n           “Yours, ever,\n\n                   PONNONNER.\n\nBy the time I had reached the “Ponnonner,” it struck me that I was\nas wide awake as a man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy,\noverthrowing all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly\nmarvellous; and set off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor’s.\n\nThere I found a very eager company assembled. They had been awaiting me\nwith much impatience; the Mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and\nthe moment I entered its examination was commenced.\n\nIt was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain\nArthur Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner’s from a tomb near Eleithias, in\nthe Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile.\nThe grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban\nsepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more\nnumerous illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians. The chamber\nfrom which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such\nillustrations; the walls being completely covered with fresco paintings\nand bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich patterns,\nindicated the vast wealth of the deceased.\n\nThe treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same\ncondition in which Captain Sabretash had found it;--that is to say,\nthe coffin had not been disturbed. For eight years it had thus stood,\nsubject only externally to public inspection. We had now, therefore,\nthe complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very\nrarely the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident,\nat once that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good\nfortune.\n\nApproaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven\nfeet long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. It\nwas oblong--not coffin-shaped. The material was at first supposed to\nbe the wood of the sycamore (_platanus_), but, upon cutting into it, we\nfound it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, _papier mache_, composed\nof papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings, representing\nfuneral scenes, and other mournful subjects--interspersed among which,\nin every variety of position, were certain series of hieroglyphical\ncharacters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the departed. By good\nluck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no difficulty in\ntranslating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and represented the\nword _Allamistakeo_.\n\nWe had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury;\nbut having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second,\ncoffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one,\nbut resembling it precisely in every other respect. The interval between\nthe two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the\ncolors of the interior box.\n\nUpon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a\nthird case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no\nparticular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still\nemitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood. Between\nthe second and the third case there was no interval--the one fitting\naccurately within the other.\n\nRemoving the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself.\nWe had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or\nbandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath,\nmade of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and\npainted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the\nvarious supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different\ndivinities, with numerous identical human figures, intended, very\nprobably, as portraits of the persons embalmed. Extending from head\nto foot was a columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic\nhieroglyphics, giving again his name and titles, and the names and\ntitles of his relations.\n\nAround the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass\nbeads, diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities,\nof the scarabaeus, etc, with the winged globe. Around the small of the\nwaist was a similar collar or belt.\n\nStripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation,\nwith no perceptible odor. The color was reddish. The skin was hard,\nsmooth, and glossy. The teeth and hair were in good condition. The eyes\n(it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were\nvery beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat\ntoo determined a stare. The fingers and the nails were brilliantly\ngilded.\n\nMr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the\nembalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping\nthe surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of\nthe powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented\ngums became apparent.\n\nWe searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through\nwhich the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could\ndiscover none. No member of the party was at that period aware that\nentire or unopened mummies are not infrequently met. The brain it\nwas customary to withdraw through the nose; the intestines through an\nincision in the side; the body was then shaved, washed, and salted; then\nlaid aside for several weeks, when the operation of embalming, properly\nso called, began.\n\nAs no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor Ponnonner was preparing\nhis instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past\ntwo o’clock. Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination\nuntil the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present,\nwhen some one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.\n\nThe application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years\nold at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently\noriginal, and we all caught it at once. About one-tenth in earnest and\nnine-tenths in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor’s study, and\nconveyed thither the Egyptian.\n\nIt was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some\nportions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity\nthan other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of\ncourse, gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in\ncontact with the wire. This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive,\nand, with a hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each\nother good night, when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the\nMummy, were there immediately riveted in amazement. My brief glance, in\nfact, had sufficed to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed\nto be glass, and which were originally noticeable for a certain wild\nstare, were now so far covered by the lids, that only a small portion of\nthe _tunica albuginea_ remained visible.\n\nWith a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately\nobvious to all.\n\nI cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because “alarmed” is,\nin my case, not exactly the word. It is possible, however, that, but for\nthe Brown Stout, I might have been a little nervous. As for the rest\nof the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright\nfright which possessed them. Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied.\nMr. Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. Mr.\nSilk Buckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he\nmade his way, upon all fours, under the table.\n\nAfter the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter\nof course, upon further experiment forthwith. Our operations were now\ndirected against the great toe of the right foot. We made an incision\nover the outside of the exterior _os sesamoideum pollicis pedis,_ and\nthus got at the root of the abductor muscle. Readjusting the battery, we\nnow applied the fluid to the bisected nerves--when, with a movement of\nexceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to\nbring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the\nlimb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner,\nwhich had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a\ncatapult, through a window into the street below.\n\nWe rushed out _en masse_ to bring in the mangled remains of the victim,\nbut had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in an\nunaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more\nthan ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment\nwith vigor and with zeal.\n\nIt was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a\nprofound incision into the tip of the subject’s nose, while the Doctor\nhimself, laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact\nwith the wire.\n\nMorally and physically--figuratively and literally--was the effect\nelectric. In the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked very\nrapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime, in the\nsecond place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the fourth,\nit shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner’s face; in the fifth, turning to\nMessieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, it addressed them, in very capital\nEgyptian, thus:\n\n“I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at\nyour behavior. Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected. He\nis a poor little fat fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive him.\nBut you, Mr. Gliddon--and you, Silk--who have travelled and resided in\nEgypt until one might imagine you to the manner born--you, I say who\nhave been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I\nthink, as you write your mother tongue--you, whom I have always been\nled to regard as the firm friend of the mummies--I really did anticipate\nmore gentlemanly conduct from you. What am I to think of your standing\nquietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? What am I to suppose by\nyour permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins, and my\nclothes, in this wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to come to the\npoint) am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little\nvillain, Doctor Ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?”\n\nIt will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech\nunder the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into\nviolent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon. One of these three\nthings was, I say, to be expected. Indeed each and all of these lines of\nconduct might have been very plausibly pursued. And, upon my word, I am\nat a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor\nthe other. But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit\nof the age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and\nis now usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of\nparadox and impossibility. Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the\nMummy’s exceedingly natural and matter-of-course air that divested his\nwords of the terrible. However this may be, the facts are clear, and no\nmember of our party betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed\nto consider that any thing had gone very especially wrong.\n\nFor my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside,\nout of the range of the Egyptian’s fist. Doctor Ponnonner thrust his\nhands into his breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew\nexcessively red in the face. Mr. Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew\nup the collar of his shirt. Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put\nhis right thumb into the left corner of his mouth.\n\nThe Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and\nat length, with a sneer, said:\n\n“Why don’t you speak, Mr. Buckingham? Did you hear what I asked you, or\nnot? Do take your thumb out of your mouth!”\n\nMr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out\nof the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted\nhis left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.\n\nNot being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly\nto Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms\nwhat we all meant.\n\nMr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the\ndeficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would\nafford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of\nhis very excellent speech.\n\nI may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent\nconversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive\nEgyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other\nuntravelled members of the company)--through the medium, I say, of\nMessieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters. These gentlemen spoke\nthe mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I\ncould not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of\nimages entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger)\nthe two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of\nsensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning.\nMr. Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian\ncomprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon the wall, with\na bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows,\nstanding upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown\nforward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and\nthe mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees. Just in the same way Mr.\nBuckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea “wig,” until\n(at Doctor Ponnonner’s suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and\nconsented to take off his own.\n\nIt will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon’s discourse turned\nchiefly upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling\nand disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any\ndisturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the\nindividual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint\n(for it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little\nmatters were now explained, it might be as well to proceed with\nthe investigation intended. Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his\ninstruments.\n\nIn regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that\nAllamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I\ndid not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the\napologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with\nthe company all round.\n\nWhen this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in\nrepairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel.\nWe sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a\nsquare inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.\n\nIt was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of\nAllamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering--no doubt from the cold. The\nDoctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with\na black dress coat, made in Jennings’ best manner, a pair of sky-blue\nplaid pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of\nbrocade, a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with\nno brim, patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a\npair of whiskers, and a waterfall cravat. Owing to the disparity of size\nbetween the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one),\nthere was some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the\nperson of the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been\nsaid to be dressed. Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led\nhim to a comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell\nupon the spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.\n\nThe conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course,\nexpressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo’s\nstill remaining alive.\n\n“I should have thought,” observed Mr. Buckingham, “that it is high time\nyou were dead.”\n\n“Why,” replied the Count, very much astonished, “I am little more than\nseven hundred years old! My father lived a thousand, and was by no means\nin his dotage when he died.”\n\nHere ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of\nwhich it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly\nmisjudged. It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months\nsince he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.\n\n“But my remark,” resumed Mr. Buckingham, “had no reference to your age\nat the period of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are\nstill a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during\nwhich, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum.”\n\n“In what?” said the Count.\n\n“In asphaltum,” persisted Mr. B.\n\n“Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made\nto answer, no doubt--but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else\nthan the Bichloride of Mercury.”\n\n“But what we are especially at a loss to understand,” said Doctor\nPonnonner, “is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt\nfive thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so\ndelightfully well.”\n\n“Had I been, as you say, dead,” replied the Count, “it is more than\nprobable that dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the\ninfancy of Calvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common\nthing among us in the old days. But the fact is, I fell into catalepsy,\nand it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or\nshould be; they accordingly embalmed me at once--I presume you are aware\nof the chief principle of the embalming process?”\n\n“Why not altogether.”\n\n“Why, I perceive--a deplorable condition of ignorance! Well I cannot\nenter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to\nembalm (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the\nanimal functions subjected to the process. I use the word ‘animal’ in\nits widest sense, as including the physical not more than the moral\nand vital being. I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment\nconsisted, with us, in the immediately arresting, and holding in\nperpetual abeyance, all the animal functions subjected to the process.\nTo be brief, in whatever condition the individual was, at the period of\nembalmment, in that condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune\nto be of the blood of the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see\nme at present.”\n\n“The blood of the Scarabaeus!” exclaimed Doctor Ponnonner.\n\n“Yes. The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the ‘arms,’ of a very\ndistinguished and very rare patrician family. To be ‘of the blood of the\nScarabaeus,’ is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus\nis the insignium. I speak figuratively.”\n\n“But what has this to do with you being alive?”\n\n“Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before\nembalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone\ndid not coincide with the custom. Had I not been a Scarabeus, therefore,\nI should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is\ninconvenient to live.”\n\n“I perceive that,” said Mr. Buckingham, “and I presume that all the\nentire mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei.”\n\n“Beyond doubt.”\n\n“I thought,” said Mr. Gliddon, very meekly, “that the Scarabaeus was one\nof the Egyptian gods.”\n\n“One of the Egyptian _what?”_ exclaimed the Mummy, starting to its feet.\n\n“Gods!” repeated the traveller.\n\n“Mr. Gliddon, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,”\n said the Count, resuming his chair. “No nation upon the face of the\nearth has ever acknowledged more than one god. The Scarabaeus, the Ibis,\netc., were with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the\nsymbols, or media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too\naugust to be more directly approached.”\n\nThere was here a pause. At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor\nPonnonner.\n\n“It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,” said he,\n“that among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of\nthe Scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality?”\n\n“There can be no question of it,” replied the Count; “all the Scarabaei\nembalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now. Even some of those\npurposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and\nstill remain in the tomb.”\n\n“Will you be kind enough to explain,” I said, “what you mean by\n‘purposely so embalmed’?”\n\n“With great pleasure!” answered the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely\nthrough his eye-glass--for it was the first time I had ventured to\naddress him a direct question.\n\n“With great pleasure,” he said. “The usual duration of man’s life, in\nmy time, was about eight hundred years. Few men died, unless by most\nextraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer\nthan a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural\nterm. After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already\ndescribed it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable\ncuriosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of\nscience much advanced, by living this natural term in installments. In\nthe case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of\nthis kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained\nthe age of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then\nget himself carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors\npro tem., that they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of\na certain period--say five or six hundred years. Resuming existence at\nthe expiration of this time, he would invariably find his great work\nconverted into a species of hap-hazard note-book--that is to say, into\na kind of literary arena for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and\npersonal squabbles of whole herds of exasperated commentators.\nThese guesses, etc., which passed under the name of annotations, or\nemendations, were found so completely to have enveloped, distorted, and\noverwhelmed the text, that the author had to go about with a lantern to\ndiscover his own book. When discovered, it was never worth the trouble\nof the search. After re-writing it throughout, it was regarded as the\nbounden duty of the historian to set himself to work immediately\nin correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience, the\ntraditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally\nlived. Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification,\npursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of\npreventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said Doctor Ponnonner at this point, laying his\nhand gently upon the arm of the Egyptian--“I beg your pardon, sir, but\nmay I presume to interrupt you for one moment?”\n\n“By all means, sir,” replied the Count, drawing up.\n\n“I merely wished to ask you a question,” said the Doctor. “You mentioned\nthe historian’s personal correction of traditions respecting his own\nepoch. Pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were\nusually found to be right?”\n\n“The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered\nto be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written\nhistories themselves;--that is to say, not one individual iota of either\nwas ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and radically\nwrong.”\n\n“But since it is quite clear,” resumed the Doctor, “that at least five\nthousand years have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for\ngranted that your histories at that period, if not your traditions\nwere sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the\nCreation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten\ncenturies before.”\n\n“Sir!” said the Count Allamistakeo.\n\nThe Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional\nexplanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. The\nlatter at length said, hesitatingly:\n\n“The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel.\nDuring my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy\nas that the universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had\na beginning at all. I remember once, and once only, hearing something\nremotely hinted, by a man of many speculations, concerning the origin\n_of the human race;_ and by this individual, the very word _Adam_\n(or Red Earth), which you make use of, was employed. He employed\nit, however, in a generical sense, with reference to the spontaneous\ngermination from rank soil (just as a thousand of the lower genera of\ncreatures are germinated)--the spontaneous germination, I say, of five\nvast hordes of men, simultaneously upspringing in five distinct and\nnearly equal divisions of the globe.”\n\nHere, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or\ntwo of us touched our foreheads with a very significant air. Mr. Silk\nBuckingham, first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the\nsinciput of Allamistakeo, spoke as follows:\n\n“The long duration of human life in your time, together with\nthe occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in\ninstallments, must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general\ndevelopment and conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore, that\nwe are to attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in\nall particulars of science, when compared with the moderns, and more\nespecially with the Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the\nEgyptian skull.”\n\n“I confess again,” replied the Count, with much suavity, “that I am\nsomewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of\nscience do you allude?”\n\nHere our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the\nassumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.\n\nHaving heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few\nanecdotes, which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and\nSpurzheim had flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been\nnearly forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very\ncontemptible tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles\nof the Theban savans, who created lice and a great many other similar\nthings.\n\nI here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He\nsmiled rather contemptuously, and said they were.\n\nThis put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard\nto his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had\nnever as yet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information\non this head, I had better consult Ptolemy (whoever Ptolemy is), as well\nas one Plutarch de facie lunae.\n\nI then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in\ngeneral, about the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my\nqueries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow,\nand begged me for God’s sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus. As\nfor the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns\npossessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the\nstyle of the Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer\nthis question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very\nextraordinary way.\n\n“Look at our architecture!” he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of\nboth the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.\n\n“Look,” he cried with enthusiasm, “at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New\nYork! or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the\nCapitol at Washington, D. C.!”--and the good little medical man went\non to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he\nreferred. He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less\nthan four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.\n\nThe Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just\nat that moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal\nbuildings of the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night\nof Time, but the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of\nhis entombment, in a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes. He\nrecollected, however, (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to\nan inferior palace in a kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a\nhundred and forty-four columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and\ntwenty-five feet apart. The approach to this portico, from the Nile,\nwas through an avenue two miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and\nobelisks, twenty, sixty, and a hundred feet in height. The palace itself\n(as well as he could remember) was, in one direction, two miles long,\nand might have been altogether about seven in circuit. Its walls were\nrichly painted all over, within and without, with hieroglyphics. He\nwould not pretend to assert that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor’s\nCapitols might have been built within these walls, but he was by\nno means sure that two or three hundred of them might not have\nbeen squeezed in with some trouble. That palace at Carnac was an\ninsignificant little building after all. He (the Count), however, could\nnot conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity, magnificence, and\nsuperiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as described by the\nDoctor. Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever been seen in\nEgypt or elsewhere.\n\nI here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.\n\n“Nothing,” he replied, “in particular.” They were rather slight, rather\nill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of\ncourse, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which\nthe Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred\nand fifty feet in altitude.\n\nI spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.\n\nHe agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should\nhave gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the\nlittle palace at Carnac.\n\nThis question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea\nof Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon\nwinked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been\nrecently discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the\nGreat Oasis.\n\nI then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and\nasked me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on\nthe obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.\n\nThis disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the\nattack to Metaphysics. We sent for a copy of a book called the “Dial,”\n and read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very\nclear, but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress.\n\nThe Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in\nhis day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but\nit never progressed.\n\nWe then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and\nwere at much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the\nadvantages we enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and\nno king.\n\nHe listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little\namused. When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had\noccurred something of a very similar sort. Thirteen Egyptian provinces\ndetermined all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to\nthe rest of mankind. They assembled their wise men, and concocted the\nmost ingenious constitution it is possible to conceive. For a while they\nmanaged remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious.\nThe thing ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states,\nwith some fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable\ndespotism that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.\n\nI asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.\n\nAs well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.\n\nNot knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the\nEgyptian ignorance of steam.\n\nThe Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. The\nsilent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his\nelbows--told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once--and demanded\nif I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern steam-engine\nis derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de Caus.\n\nWe were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck\nwould have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue,\nand inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the\nmoderns in the all--important particular of dress.\n\nThe Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons,\nand then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up\nclose to his eyes for some minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth\nextended itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember\nthat he said any thing in the way of reply.\n\nHereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy\nwith great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as\na gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the\nmanufacture of either Ponnonner’s lozenges or Brandreth’s pills.\n\nWe looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer--but in vain. It was\nnot forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head. Never was\ntriumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a\ngrace. Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy’s\nmortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave.\n\nUpon getting home I found it past four o’clock, and went immediately\nto bed. It is now ten A.M. I have been up since seven, penning these\nmemoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind. The former I\nshall behold no more. My wife is a shrew. The truth is, I am heartily\nsick of this life and of the nineteenth century in general. I am\nconvinced that every thing is going wrong. Besides, I am anxious to\nknow who will be President in 2045. As soon, therefore, as I shave and\nswallow a cup of coffee, I shall just step over to Ponnonner’s and get\nembalmed for a couple of hundred years.\n\n","\n'William, as you may know, was a curious, silent man; you could feel when\nhe came near 'ee; and if he was in the house or anywhere behind your back\nwithout your seeing him, there seemed to be something clammy in the air,\nas if a cellar door was opened close by your elbow.  Well, one Sunday, at\na time that William was in very good health to all appearance, the bell\nthat was ringing for church went very heavy all of a sudden; the sexton,\nwho told me o't, said he'd not known the bell go so heavy in his hand for\nyears--it was just as if the gudgeons wanted oiling.  That was on the\nSunday, as I say.  During the week after, it chanced that William's wife\nwas staying up late one night to finish her ironing, she doing the\nwashing for Mr. and Mrs. Hardcome.  Her husband had finished his supper\nand gone to bed as usual some hour or two before.  While she ironed she\nheard him coming down stairs; he stopped to put on his boots at the stair-\nfoot, where he always left them, and then came on into the living-room\nwhere she was ironing, passing through it towards the door, this being\nthe only way from the staircase to the outside of the house.  No word was\nsaid on either side, William not being a man given to much speaking, and\nhis wife being occupied with her work.  He went out and closed the door\nbehind him.  As her husband had now and then gone out in this way at\nnight before when unwell, or unable to sleep for want of a pipe, she took\nno particular notice, and continued at her ironing.  This she finished\nshortly after, and as he had not come in she waited awhile for him,\nputting away the irons and things, and preparing the table for his\nbreakfast in the morning.  Still he did not return, but supposing him not\nfar off, and wanting to get to bed herself, tired as she was, she left\nthe door unbarred and went to the stairs, after writing on the back of\nthe door with chalk: _Mind and do the door_ (because he was a forgetful\nman).\n\n'To her great surprise, and I might say alarm, on reaching the foot of\nthe stairs his boots were standing there as they always stood when he had\ngone to rest; going up to their chamber she found him in bed sleeping as\nsound as a rock.  How he could have got back again without her seeing or\nhearing him was beyond her comprehension.  It could only have been by\npassing behind her very quietly while she was bumping with the iron.  But\nthis notion did not satisfy her: it was surely impossible that she should\nnot have seen him come in through a room so small.  She could not unravel\nthe mystery, and felt very queer and uncomfortable about it.  However,\nshe would not disturb him to question him then, and went to bed herself.\n\n'He rose and left for his work very early the next morning, before she\nwas awake, and she waited his return to breakfast with much anxiety for\nan explanation, for thinking over the matter by daylight made it seem\nonly the more startling.  When he came in to the meal he said, before she\ncould put her question, \"What's the meaning of them words chalked on the\ndoor?\"\n\n'She told him, and asked him about his going out the night before.\nWilliam declared that he had never left the bedroom after entering it,\nhaving in fact undressed, lain down, and fallen asleep directly, never\nonce waking till the clock struck five, and he rose up to go to his\nlabour.\n\n'Betty Privett was as certain in her own mind that he did go out as she\nwas of her own existence, and was little less certain that he did not\nreturn.  She felt too disturbed to argue with him, and let the subject\ndrop as though she must have been mistaken.  When she was walking down\nLongpuddle street later in the day she met Jim Weedle's daughter Nancy,\nand said, \"Well, Nancy, you do look sleepy to-day!\"\n\n'\"Yes, Mrs. Privett,\" says Nancy.  \"Now don't tell anybody, but I don't\nmind letting you know what the reason o't is.  Last night, being Old\nMidsummer Eve, some of us went to church porch, and didn't get home till\nnear one.\"\n\n'\"Did ye?\" says Mrs. Privett.  \"Old Midsummer yesterday was it?  Faith I\ndidn't think whe'r 'twas Midsummer or Michaelmas; I'd too much work to\ndo.\"\n\n'\"Yes.  And we were frightened enough, I can tell 'ee, by what we saw.\"\n\n'\"What did ye see?\"\n\n'(You may not remember, sir, having gone off to foreign parts so young,\nthat on Midsummer Night it is believed hereabout that the faint shapes of\nall the folk in the parish who are going to be at death's door within the\nyear can be seen entering the church.  Those who get over their illness\ncome out again after a while; those that are doomed to die do not\nreturn.)\n\n'\"What did you see?\" asked William's wife.\n\n'\"Well,\" says Nancy, backwardly--\"we needn't tell what we saw, or who we\nsaw.\"\n\n'\"You saw my husband,\" says Betty Privett, in a quiet way.\n\n'\"Well, since you put it so,\" says Nancy, hanging fire, \"we--thought we\ndid see him; but it was darkish, and we was frightened, and of course it\nmight not have been he.\"\n\n'\"Nancy, you needn't mind letting it out, though 'tis kept back in\nkindness.  And he didn't come out of church again: I know it as well as\nyou.\"\n\n'Nancy did not answer yes or no to that, and no more was said.  But three\ndays after, William Privett was mowing with John Chiles in Mr. Hardcome's\nmeadow, and in the heat of the day they sat down to eat their bit o'\nnunch under a tree, and empty their flagon.  Afterwards both of 'em fell\nasleep as they sat.  John Chiles was the first to wake, and as he looked\ntowards his fellow-mower he saw one of those great white miller's-souls\nas we call 'em--that is to say, a miller-moth--come from William's open\nmouth while he slept, and fly straight away.  John thought it odd enough,\nas William had worked in a mill for several years when he was a boy.  He\nthen looked at the sun, and found by the place o't that they had slept a\nlong while, and as William did not wake, John called to him and said it\nwas high time to begin work again.  He took no notice, and then John went\nup and shook him, and found he was dead.\n\n'Now on that very day old Philip Hookhorn was down at Longpuddle Spring\ndipping up a pitcher of water; and as he turned away, who should he see\ncoming down to the spring on the other side but William, looking very\npale and odd.  This surprised Philip Hookhorn very much, for years before\nthat time William's little son--his only child--had been drowned in that\nspring while at play there, and this had so preyed upon William's mind\nthat he'd never been seen near the spring afterwards, and had been known\nto go half a mile out of his way to avoid the place.  On inquiry, it was\nfound that William in body could not have stood by the spring, being in\nthe mead two miles off; and it also came out that the time at which he\nwas seen at the spring was the very time when he died.'\n\n* * * * *\n\n'A rather melancholy story,' observed the emigrant, after a minute's\nsilence.\n\n'Yes, yes.  Well, we must take ups and downs together,' said the\nseedsman's father.\n\n'You don't know, Mr. Lackland, I suppose, what a rum start that was\nbetween Andrey Satchel and Jane Vallens and the pa'son and clerk o'\nScrimpton?' said the master-thatcher, a man with a spark of subdued\nliveliness in his eye, who had hitherto kept his attention mainly upon\nsmall objects a long way ahead, as he sat in front of the van with his\nfeet outside.  'Theirs was a queerer experience of a pa'son and clerk\nthan some folks get, and may cheer 'ee up a little after this dampness\nthat's been flung over yer soul.'\n\nThe returned one replied that he knew nothing of the history, and should\nbe happy to hear it, quite recollecting the personality of the man\nSatchel.\n\n'Ah no; this Andrey Satchel is the son of the Satchel that you knew; this\none has not been married more than two or three years, and 'twas at the\ntime o' the wedding that the accident happened that I could tell 'ee of,\nor anybody else here, for that matter.'\n\n'No, no; you must tell it, neighbour, if anybody,' said several; a\nrequest in which Mr. Lackland joined, adding that the Satchel family was\none he had known well before leaving home.\n\n'I'll just mention, as you be a stranger,' whispered the carrier to\nLackland, 'that Christopher's stories will bear pruning.'\n\nThe emigrant nodded.\n\n'Well, I can soon tell it,' said the master-thatcher, schooling himself\nto a tone of actuality.  'Though as it has more to do with the pa'son and\nclerk than with Andrey himself, it ought to be told by a better churchman\nthan I.'\n\n","Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down.\nand I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air.\n\nIn west Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground was where I spent most of my days.\nChillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool, and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school.\nWhen a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood,\nI got in one little fight and my mom got scared, she said, \"You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air\".\n\nI begged and pleaded with her day after day but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way.\nShe gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. I put my Walkman on and said, \"I might as well kick it\".\n\nFirst class, yo, this is bad. Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.\nIs this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmm, this might be alright.\n\nBut wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that. Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?\nI don't think so, I'll see when I get there.\nI hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air.\n\nWell, the plane landed and when I came out. There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out.\nI ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here.\nI sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared.\n\nI whistled for a cab and when it came near. The license plate said \"Fresh\" and it had dice in the mirror.\nIf anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, \"Nah, forget it\" – \"Yo, home to Bel-Air\"!\n\nI pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabbie, \"Yo home smell ya later\".\nI looked at my kingdom, I was finally there. To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air.\n\n","HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy\nPrince.  He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes\nhe had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his\nsword-hilt.\n\nHe was very much admired indeed.  “He is as beautiful as a weathercock,”\nremarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for\nhaving artistic tastes; “only not quite so useful,” he added, fearing\nlest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\n\n“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince?” asked a sensible mother of her\nlittle boy who was crying for the moon.  “The Happy Prince never dreams\nof crying for anything.”\n\n“I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,” muttered a\ndisappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\n\n“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came out\nof the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white\npinafores.\n\n“How do you know?” said the Mathematical Master, “you have never seen\none.”\n\n“Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the\nMathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not\napprove of children dreaming.\n\nOne night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had\ngone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was\nin love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring\nas he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so\nattracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\n\n“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at\nonce, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her,\ntouching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was\nhis courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\n\n“It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; “she has\nno money, and far too many relations”; and indeed the river was quite\nfull of Reeds.  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.\n\nAfter they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love.\n“She has no conversation,” he said, “and I am afraid that she is a\ncoquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.”  And certainly,\nwhenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.  “I\nadmit that she is domestic,” he continued, “but I love travelling, and my\nwife, consequently, should love travelling also.”\n\n“Will you come away with me?” he said finally to her; but the Reed shook\nher head, she was so attached to her home.\n\n“You have been trifling with me,” he cried.  “I am off to the Pyramids.\nGood-bye!” and he flew away.\n\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.  “Where\nshall I put up?” he said; “I hope the town has made preparations.”\n\nThen he saw the statue on the tall column.\n\n“I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a fine position, with plenty of\nfresh air.”  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.\n\n“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to himself as he looked round,\nand he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under\nhis wing a large drop of water fell on him.  “What a curious thing!” he\ncried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear\nand bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is\nreally dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her\nselfishness.”\n\nThen another drop fell.\n\n“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?” he said; “I\nmust look for a good chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away.\n\nBut before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up,\nand saw—Ah! what did he see?\n\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were\nrunning down his golden cheeks.  His face was so beautiful in the\nmoonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.\n\n“Who are you?” he said.\n\n“I am the Happy Prince.”\n\n“Why are you weeping then?” asked the Swallow; “you have quite drenched\nme.”\n\n“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue, “I did not\nknow what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where\nsorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my\ncompanions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great\nHall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask\nwhat lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers\ncalled me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be\nhappiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have\nset me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery\nof my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but\nweep.”\n\n“What! is he not solid gold?” said the Swallow to himself.  He was too\npolite to make any personal remarks out loud.\n\n“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away in a\nlittle street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and\nthrough it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and\nworn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she\nis a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for\nthe loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next\nCourt-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying\nill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing\nto give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little\nSwallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet\nare fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow.  “My friends are flying up\nand down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.  Soon they\nwill go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.  The King is there\nhimself in his painted coffin.  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and\nembalmed with spices.  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and\nhis hands are like withered leaves.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and\nthe mother so sad.”\n\n“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow.  “Last summer, when I\nwas staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons,\nwho were always throwing stones at me.  They never hit me, of course; we\nswallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family\nfamous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.”\n\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.\n“It is very cold here,” he said; “but I will stay with you for one night,\nand be your messenger.”\n\n“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince.\n\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword, and\nflew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\n\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were\nsculptured.  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.  A\nbeautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.  “How wonderful\nthe stars are,” he said to her, “and how wonderful is the power of love!”\n\n“I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,” she answered;\n“I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the\nseamstresses are so lazy.”\n\nHe passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of\nthe ships.  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining\nwith each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.  At last he\ncame to the poor house and looked in.  The boy was tossing feverishly on\nhis bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.  In he\nhopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble.\nThen he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy’s forehead with his\nwings.  “How cool I feel,” said the boy, “I must be getting better”; and\nhe sank into a delicious slumber.\n\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had\ndone.  “It is curious,” he remarked, “but I feel quite warm now, although\nit is so cold.”\n\n“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince.  And the\nlittle Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.  Thinking always\nmade him sleepy.\n\nWhen day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  “What a\nremarkable phenomenon,” said the Professor of Ornithology as he was\npassing over the bridge.  “A swallow in winter!”  And he wrote a long\nletter about it to the local newspaper.  Every one quoted it, it was full\nof so many words that they could not understand.\n\n“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at\nthe prospect.  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time\non top of the church steeple.  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped,\nand said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger!” so he enjoyed\nhimself very much.\n\nWhen the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  “Have you any\ncommissions for Egypt?” he cried; “I am just starting.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me one night longer?”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow.  “To-morrow my friends\nwill fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among\nthe bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All\nnight long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he\nutters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions\ncome down to the water’s edge to drink.  They have eyes like green\nberyls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away across the\ncity I see a young man in a garret.  He is leaning over a desk covered\nwith papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered\nviolets.  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a\npomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.  He is trying to finish a\nplay for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any\nmore.  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.”\n\n“I will wait with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, who really had\na good heart.  “Shall I take him another ruby?”\n\n“Alas!  I have no ruby now,” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that I\nhave left.  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of\nIndia a thousand years ago.  Pluck out one of them and take it to him.\nHe will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish\nhis play.”\n\n“Dear Prince,” said the Swallow, “I cannot do that”; and he began to\nweep.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\nyou.”\n\nSo the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and flew away to the\nstudent’s garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in\nthe roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room.  The young man\nhad his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the\nbird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying\non the withered violets.\n\n“I am beginning to be appreciated,” he cried; “this is from some great\nadmirer.  Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy.\n\nThe next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of\na large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold\nwith ropes.  “Heave a-hoy!” they shouted as each chest came up.  “I am\ngoing to Egypt”! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon\nrose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\n\n“I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me one night longer?”\n\n“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon be\nhere.  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the\ncrocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  My companions are\nbuilding a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves\nare watching them, and cooing to each other.  Dear Prince, I must leave\nyou, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back\ntwo beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.  The ruby\nshall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the\ngreat sea.”\n\n“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little\nmatch-girl.  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all\nspoiled.  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money,\nand she is crying.  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is\nbare.  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will\nnot beat her.”\n\n“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, “but I cannot\npluck out your eye.  You would be quite blind then.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\nyou.”\n\nSo he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down with it.  He\nswooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her\nhand.  “What a lovely bit of glass,” cried the little girl; and she ran\nhome, laughing.\n\nThen the Swallow came back to the Prince.  “You are blind now,” he said,\n“so I will stay with you always.”\n\n“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away to Egypt.”\n\n“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the\nPrince’s feet.\n\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him stories of\nwhat he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who\nstand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their\nbeaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the\ndesert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the\nside of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King\nof the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a\nlarge crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and\nhas twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who\nsail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the\nbutterflies.\n\n“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous\nthings, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of\nwomen.  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.  Fly over my city, little\nSwallow, and tell me what you see there.”\n\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in\ntheir beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He\nflew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children\nlooking out listlessly at the black streets.  Under the archway of a\nbridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep\nthemselves warm.  “How hungry we are!” they said.  “You must not lie\nhere,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\n\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\n\n“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it off,\nleaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold\ncan make them happy.”\n\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy\nPrince looked quite dull and grey.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he\nbrought to the poor, and the children’s faces grew rosier, and they\nlaughed and played games in the street.  “We have bread now!” they cried.\n\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  The streets\nlooked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and\nglistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of\nthe houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore\nscarlet caps and skated on the ice.\n\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave\nthe Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the\nbaker’s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself\nwarm by flapping his wings.\n\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die.  He had just strength to\nfly up to the Prince’s shoulder once more.  “Good-bye, dear Prince!” he\nmurmured, “will you let me kiss your hand?”\n\n“I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,” said the\nPrince, “you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips,\nfor I love you.”\n\n“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the Swallow.  “I am going to\nthe House of Death.  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?”\n\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his\nfeet.\n\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something\nhad broken.  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.\nIt certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\n\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in\ncompany with the Town Councillors.  As they passed the column he looked\nup at the statue: “Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!” he said.\n\n“How shabby indeed!” cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with\nthe Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\n\n“The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is\ngolden no longer,” said the Mayor in fact, “he is litttle better than a\nbeggar!”\n\n“Little better than a beggar,” said the Town Councillors.\n\n“And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!” continued the Mayor.  “We\nmust really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die\nhere.”  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.\n\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.  “As he is no longer\nbeautiful he is no longer useful,” said the Art Professor at the\nUniversity.\n\nThen they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of\nthe Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.  “We must\nhave another statue, of course,” he said, “and it shall be a statue of\nmyself.”\n\n“Of myself,” said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.\nWhen I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.\n\n“What a strange thing!” said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.\n“This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.  We must throw it\naway.”  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also\nlying.\n\n“Bring me the two most precious things in the city,” said God to one of\nHis Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.\n\n“You have rightly chosen,” said God, “for in my garden of Paradise this\nlittle bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy\nPrince shall praise me.”\n\n","\nDURING the dread reign of the Cholera in New York, I had accepted the\ninvitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement\nof his _cottage ornee_ on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around\nus all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling\nin the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books,\nwe should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful\nintelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city.\nNot a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some\nacquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily\nthe loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every\nmessenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.\nThat palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I\ncould neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was\nof a less excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in\nspirits, exerted himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical\nintellect was not at any time affected by unrealities. To the substances\nof terror he was sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no\napprehension.\n\nHis endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into\nwhich I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain\nvolumes which I had found in his library. These were of a character to\nforce into germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition\nlay latent in my bosom. I had been reading these books without his\nknowledge, and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible\nimpressions which had been made upon my fancy.\n\nA favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens--a belief\nwhich, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed\nto defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions--he\nmaintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,--I\ncontending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneity-\nthat is to say, without apparent traces of suggestion--had in itself the\nunmistakable elements of truth, and was entitled to as much respect\nas that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of\ngenius.\n\nThe fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had\noccurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had\nin it so much of the portentous character, that I might well have been\nexcused for regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time\nso confounded and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could\nmake up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend.\n\nNear the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at\nan open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a\nview of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been\ndenuded by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its\ntrees. My thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to\nthe gloom and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes\nfrom the page, they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an\nobject--upon some living monster of hideous conformation, which very\nrapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally\nin the dense forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I\ndoubted my own sanity--or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and\nmany minutes passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was\nneither mad nor in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which\nI distinctly saw, and calmly surveyed through the whole period of\nits progress), my readers, I fear, will feel more difficulty in being\nconvinced of these points than even I did myself.\n\nEstimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of\nthe large trees near which it passed--the few giants of the forest which\nhad escaped the fury of the land-slide--I concluded it to be far larger\nthan any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line, because\nthe shape of the monster suggested the idea--the hull of one of our\nseventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the general\noutline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a\nproboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as\nthe body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was\nan immense quantity of black shaggy hair--more than could have been\nsupplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this\nhair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike\nthose of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending\nforward, parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a\ngigantic staff, thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure\ncrystal and in shape a perfect prism,--it reflected in the most gorgeous\nmanner the rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a\nwedge with the apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs\nof wings--each wing nearly one hundred yards in length--one pair being\nplaced above the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each\nscale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that\nthe upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But\nthe chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a\nDeath’s Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and\nwhich was as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of\nthe body, as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While\nI regarded the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance\non its breast, with a feeling or horror and awe--with a sentiment of\nforthcoming evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of\nthe reason, I perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis\nsuddenly expand themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so\nloud and so expressive of wo, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell\nand as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once,\nfainting, to the floor.\n\nUpon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend\nof what I had seen and heard--and I can scarcely explain what feeling of\nrepugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.\n\nAt length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we\nwere sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition--I\noccupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa\nnear at hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to\ngive him an account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end--at first\nlaughed heartily--and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as\nif my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again\nhad a distinct view of the monster--to which, with a shout of absolute\nterror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly--but maintained\nthat he saw nothing--although I designated minutely the course of the\ncreature, as it made its way down the naked face of the hill.\n\nI was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an\nomen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I\nthrew myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried\nmy face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no\nlonger apparent.\n\nMy host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his\ndemeanor, and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the\nconformation of the visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied\nhim on this head, he sighed deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable\nburden, and went on to talk, with what I thought a cruel calmness, of\nvarious points of speculative philosophy, which had heretofore formed\nsubject of discussion between us. I remember his insisting very\nespecially (among other things) upon the idea that the principle\nsource of error in all human investigations lay in the liability of\nthe understanding to under-rate or to over-value the importance of an\nobject, through mere mis-admeasurement of its propinquity. “To estimate\nproperly, for example,” he said, “the influence to be exercised on\nmankind at large by the thorough diffusion of Democracy, the distance\nof the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accomplished should\nnot fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can you tell me one writer\non the subject of government who has ever thought this particular branch\nof the subject worthy of discussion at all?”\n\nHe here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth\none of the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to\nexchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine\nprint of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the\nbook, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.\n\n“But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the\nmonster, I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you\nwhat it was. In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy\naccount of the genus Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order\nLepidoptera, of the class of Insecta--or insects. The account runs thus:\n\n“‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic\nappearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation\nof the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of\nmandibles and downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior\nby a stiff hair; antennae in the form of an elongated club, prismatic;\nabdomen pointed, The Death’s--headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror\namong the vulgar, at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it\nutters, and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”\n\nHe here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing\nhimself accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of\nbeholding “the monster.”\n\n“Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed--“it is reascending the face\nof the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.\nStill, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,--for\nthe fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some\nspider has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the\nsixteenth of an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth\nof an inch distant from the pupil of my eye.”\n\n","\n'Talking of Exhibitions, World's Fairs, and what not,' said the old\ngentleman, 'I would not go round the corner to see a dozen of them\nnowadays.  The only exhibition that ever made, or ever will make, any\nimpression upon my imagination was the first of the series, the parent of\nthem all, and now a thing of old times--the Great Exhibition of 1851, in\nHyde Park, London.  None of the younger generation can realize the sense\nof novelty it produced in us who were then in our prime.  A noun\nsubstantive went so far as to become an adjective in honour of the\noccasion.  It was \"exhibition\" hat, \"exhibition\" razor-strop,\n\"exhibition\" watch; nay, even \"exhibition\" weather, \"exhibition\" spirits,\nsweethearts, babies, wives--for the time.\n\n'For South Wessex, the year formed in many ways an extraordinary\nchronological frontier or transit-line, at which there occurred what one\nmight call a precipice in Time.  As in a geological \"fault,\" we had\npresented to us a sudden bringing of ancient and modern into absolute\ncontact, such as probably in no other single year since the Conquest was\never witnessed in this part of the country.'\n\nThese observations led us onward to talk of the different personages,\ngentle and simple, who lived and moved within our narrow and peaceful\nhorizon at that time; and of three people in particular, whose queer\nlittle history was oddly touched at points by the Exhibition, more\nconcerned with it than that of anybody else who dwelt in those outlying\nshades of the world, Stickleford, Mellstock, and Egdon.  First in\nprominence among these three came Wat Ollamoor--if that were his real\nname--whom the seniors in our party had known well.\n\nHe was a woman's man, they said,--supremely so--externally little else.\nTo men he was not attractive; perhaps a little repulsive at times.\nMusician, dandy, and company-man in practice; veterinary surgeon in\ntheory, he lodged awhile in Mellstock village, coming from nobody knew\nwhere; though some said his first appearance in this neighbourhood had\nbeen as fiddle-player in a show at Greenhill Fair.\n\nMany a worthy villager envied him his power over unsophisticated\nmaidenhood--a power which seemed sometimes to have a touch of the weird\nand wizardly in it.  Personally he was not ill-favoured, though rather un-\nEnglish, his complexion being a rich olive, his rank hair dark and rather\nclammy--made still clammier by secret ointments, which, when he came\nfresh to a party, caused him to smell like 'boys'-love' (southernwood)\nsteeped in lamp-oil.  On occasion he wore curls--a double row--running\nalmost horizontally around his head.  But as these were sometimes\nnoticeably absent, it was concluded that they were not altogether of\nNature's making.  By girls whose love for him had turned to hatred he had\nbeen nicknamed 'Mop,' from this abundance of hair, which was long enough\nto rest upon his shoulders; as time passed the name more and more\nprevailed.\n\nHis fiddling possibly had the most to do with the fascination he\nexercised, for, to speak fairly, it could claim for itself a most\npeculiar and personal quality, like that in a moving preacher.  There\nwere tones in it which bred the immediate conviction that indolence and\naverseness to systematic application were all that lay between 'Mop' and\nthe career of a second Paganini.\n\nWhile playing he invariably closed his eyes; using no notes, and, as it\nwere, allowing the violin to wander on at will into the most plaintive\npassages ever heard by rustic man.  There was a certain lingual character\nin the supplicatory expressions he produced, which would well nigh have\ndrawn an ache from the heart of a gate-post.  He could make any child in\nthe parish, who was at all sensitive to music, burst into tears in a few\nminutes by simply fiddling one of the old dance-tunes he almost entirely\naffected--country jigs, reels, and 'Favourite Quick Steps' of the last\ncentury--some mutilated remains of which even now reappear as nameless\nphantoms in new quadrilles and gallops, where they are recognized only by\nthe curious, or by such old-fashioned and far-between people as have been\nthrown with men like Wat Ollamoor in their early life.\n\nHis date was a little later than that of the old Mellstock quire-band\nwhich comprised the Dewys, Mail, and the rest--in fact, he did not rise\nabove the horizon thereabout till those well-known musicians were\ndisbanded as ecclesiastical functionaries.  In their honest love of\nthoroughness they despised the new man's style.  Theophilus Dewy (Reuben\nthe tranter's younger brother) used to say there was no 'plumness' in\nit--no bowing, no solidity--it was all fantastical.  And probably this\nwas true.  Anyhow, Mop had, very obviously, never bowed a note of church-\nmusic from his birth; he never once sat in the gallery of Mellstock\nchurch where the others had tuned their venerable psalmody so many\nhundreds of times; had never, in all likelihood, entered a church at all.\nAll were devil's tunes in his repertory.  'He could no more play the Wold\nHundredth to his true time than he could play the brazen serpent,' the\ntranter would say.  (The brazen serpent was supposed in Mellstock to be a\nmusical instrument particularly hard to blow.)\n\nOccasionally Mop could produce the aforesaid moving effect upon the souls\nof grown-up persons, especially young women of fragile and responsive\norganization.  Such an one was Car'line Aspent.  Though she was already\nengaged to be married before she met him, Car'line, of them all, was the\nmost influenced by Mop Ollamoor's heart-stealing melodies, to her\ndiscomfort, nay, positive pain and ultimate injury.  She was a pretty,\ninvocating, weak-mouthed girl, whose chief defect as a companion with her\nsex was a tendency to peevishness now and then.  At this time she was not\na resident in Mellstock parish where Mop lodged, but lived some miles off\nat Stickleford, farther down the river.\n\nHow and where she first made acquaintance with him and his fiddling is\nnot truly known, but the story was that it either began or was developed\non one spring evening, when, in passing through Lower Mellstock, she\nchanced to pause on the bridge near his house to rest herself, and\nlanguidly leaned over the parapet.  Mop was standing on his door-step, as\nwas his custom, spinning the insidious thread of semi- and\ndemi-semi-quavers from the E string of his fiddle for the benefit of\npassers-by, and laughing as the tears rolled down the cheeks of the\nlittle children hanging around him.  Car'line pretended to be engrossed\nwith the rippling of the stream under the arches, but in reality she was\nlistening, as he knew.  Presently the aching of the heart seized her\nsimultaneously with a wild desire to glide airily in the mazes of an\ninfinite dance.  To shake off the fascination she resolved to go on,\nalthough it would be necessary to pass him as he played.  On stealthily\nglancing ahead at the performer, she found to her relief that his eyes\nwere closed in abandonment to instrumentation, and she strode on boldly.\nBut when closer her step grew timid, her tread convulsed itself more and\nmore accordantly with the time of the melody, till she very nearly danced\nalong.  Gaining another glance at him when immediately opposite, she saw\nthat _one_ of his eyes was open, quizzing her as he smiled at her\nemotional state.  Her gait could not divest itself of its compelled\ncapers till she had gone a long way past the house; and Car'line was\nunable to shake off the strange infatuation for hours.\n\nAfter that day, whenever there was to be in the neighbourhood a dance to\nwhich she could get an invitation, and where Mop Ollamoor was to be the\nmusician, Car'line contrived to be present, though it sometimes involved\na walk of several miles; for he did not play so often in Stickleford as\nelsewhere.\n\nThe next evidences of his influence over her were singular enough, and it\nwould require a neurologist to fully explain them.  She would be sitting\nquietly, any evening after dark, in the house of her father, the parish\nclerk, which stood in the middle of Stickleford village street, this\nbeing the highroad between Lower Mellstock and Moreford, five miles\neastward.  Here, without a moment's warning, and in the midst of a\ngeneral conversation between her father, sister, and the young man before\nalluded to, who devotedly wooed her in ignorance of her infatuation, she\nwould start from her seat in the chimney-corner as if she had received a\ngalvanic shock, and spring convulsively towards the ceiling; then she\nwould burst into tears, and it was not till some half-hour had passed\nthat she grew calm as usual.  Her father, knowing her hysterical\ntendencies, was always excessively anxious about this trait in his\nyoungest girl, and feared the attack to be a species of epileptic fit.\nNot so her sister Julia.  Julia had found out what was the cause.  At the\nmoment before the jumping, only an exceptionally sensitive ear situated\nin the chimney-nook could have caught from down the flue the beat of a\nman's footstep along the highway without.  But it was in that footfall,\nfor which she had been waiting, that the origin of Car'line's involuntary\nspringing lay.  The pedestrian was Mop Ollamoor, as the girl well knew;\nbut his business that way was not to visit her; he sought another woman\nwhom he spoke of as his Intended, and who lived at Moreford, two miles\nfarther on.  On one, and only one, occasion did it happen that Car'line\ncould not control her utterance; it was when her sister alone chanced to\nbe present.  'Oh--oh--oh--!' she cried.  'He's going to _her_, and not\ncoming to _me_!'\n\nTo do the fiddler justice he had not at first thought greatly of, or\nspoken much to, this girl of impressionable mould.  But he had soon found\nout her secret, and could not resist a little by-play with her too easily\nhurt heart, as an interlude between his more serious performances at\nMoreford.  The two became well acquainted, though only by stealth, hardly\na soul in Stickleford except her sister, and her lover Ned Hipcroft,\nbeing aware of the attachment.  Her father disapproved of her coldness to\nNed; her sister, too, hoped she might get over this nervous passion for a\nman of whom so little was known.  The ultimate result was that Car'line's\nmanly and simple wooer Edward found his suit becoming practically\nhopeless.  He was a respectable mechanic, in a far sounder position than\nMop the nominal horse-doctor; but when, before leaving her, Ned put his\nflat and final question, would she marry him, then and there, now or\nnever, it was with little expectation of obtaining more than the negative\nshe gave him.  Though her father supported him and her sister supported\nhim, he could not play the fiddle so as to draw your soul out of your\nbody like a spider's thread, as Mop did, till you felt as limp as withy-\nwind and yearned for something to cling to.  Indeed, Hipcroft had not the\nslightest ear for music; could not sing two notes in tune, much less play\nthem.\n\nThe No he had expected and got from her, in spite of a preliminary\nencouragement, gave Ned a new start in life.  It had been uttered in such\na tone of sad entreaty that he resolved to persecute her no more; she\nshould not even be distressed by a sight of his form in the distant\nperspective of the street and lane.  He left the place, and his natural\ncourse was to London.\n\nThe railway to South Wessex was in process of construction, but it was\nnot as yet opened for traffic; and Hipcroft reached the capital by a six\ndays' trudge on foot, as many a better man had done before him.  He was\none of the last of the artisan class who used that now extinct method of\ntravel to the great centres of labour, so customary then from time\nimmemorial.\n\nIn London he lived and worked regularly at his trade.  More fortunate\nthan many, his disinterested willingness recommended him from the first.\nDuring the ensuing four years he was never out of employment.  He neither\nadvanced nor receded in the modern sense; he improved as a workman, but\nhe did not shift one jot in social position.  About his love for Car'line\nhe maintained a rigid silence.  No doubt he often thought of her; but\nbeing always occupied, and having no relations at Stickleford, he held no\ncommunication with that part of the country, and showed no desire to\nreturn.  In his quiet lodging in Lambeth he moved about after working-\nhours with the facility of a woman, doing his own cooking, attending to\nhis stocking-heels, and shaping himself by degrees to a life-long\nbachelorhood.  For this conduct one is bound to advance the canonical\nreason that time could not efface from his heart the image of little\nCar'line Aspent--and it may be in part true; but there was also the\ninference that his was a nature not greatly dependent upon the\nministrations of the other sex for its comforts.\n\nThe fourth year of his residence as a mechanic in London was the year of\nthe Hyde-Park Exhibition already mentioned, and at the construction of\nthis huge glass-house, then unexampled in the world's history, he worked\ndaily.  It was an era of great hope and activity among the nations and\nindustries.  Though Hipcroft was, in his small way, a central man in the\nmovement, he plodded on with his usual outward placidity.  Yet for him,\ntoo, the year was destined to have its surprises, for when the bustle of\ngetting the building ready for the opening day was past, the ceremonies\nhad been witnessed, and people were flocking thither from all parts of\nthe globe, he received a letter from Car'line.  Till that day the silence\nof four years between himself and Stickleford had never been broken.\n\nShe informed her old lover, in an uncertain penmanship which suggested a\ntrembling hand, of the trouble she had been put to in ascertaining his\naddress, and then broached the subject which had prompted her to write.\nFour years ago, she said with the greatest delicacy of which she was\ncapable, she had been so foolish as to refuse him.  Her wilful\nwrong-headedness had since been a grief to her many times, and of late\nparticularly.  As for Mr. Ollamoor, he had been absent almost as long as\nNed--she did not know where.  She would gladly marry Ned now if he were\nto ask her again, and be a tender little wife to him till her life's end.\n\nA tide of warm feeling must have surged through Ned Hipcroft's frame on\nreceipt of this news, if we may judge by the issue.  Unquestionably he\nloved her still, even if not to the exclusion of every other happiness.\nThis from his Car'line, she who had been dead to him these many years,\nalive to him again as of old, was in itself a pleasant, gratifying thing.\nNed had grown so resigned to, or satisfied with, his lonely lot, that he\nprobably would not have shown much jubilation at anything.  Still, a\ncertain ardour of preoccupation, after his first surprise, revealed how\ndeeply her confession of faith in him had stirred him.  Measured and\nmethodical in his ways, he did not answer the letter that day, nor the\nnext, nor the next.  He was having 'a good think.'  When he did answer\nit, there was a great deal of sound reasoning mixed in with the\nunmistakable tenderness of his reply; but the tenderness itself was\nsufficient to reveal that he was pleased with her straightforward\nfrankness; that the anchorage she had once obtained in his heart was\nrenewable, if it had not been continuously firm.\n\nHe told her--and as he wrote his lips twitched humorously over the few\ngentle words of raillery he indited among the rest of his sentences--that\nit was all very well for her to come round at this time of day.  Why\nwouldn't she have him when he wanted her?  She had no doubt learned that\nhe was not married, but suppose his affections had since been fixed on\nanother?  She ought to beg his pardon.  Still, he was not the man to\nforget her.  But considering how he had been used, and what he had\nsuffered, she could not quite expect him to go down to Stickleford and\nfetch her.  But if she would come to him, and say she was sorry, as was\nonly fair; why, yes, he would marry her, knowing what a good little woman\nshe was at the core.  He added that the request for her to come to him\nwas a less one to make than it would have been when he first left\nStickleford, or even a few months ago; for the new railway into South\nWessex was now open, and there had just begun to be run wonderfully\ncontrived special trains, called excursion-trains, on account of the\nGreat Exhibition; so that she could come up easily alone.\n\nShe said in her reply how good it was of him to treat her so generously,\nafter her hot and cold treatment of him; that though she felt frightened\nat the magnitude of the journey, and was never as yet in a railway-train,\nhaving only seen one pass at a distance, she embraced his offer with all\nher heart; and would, indeed, own to him how sorry she was, and beg his\npardon, and try to be a good wife always, and make up for lost time.\n\nThe remaining details of when and where were soon settled, Car'line\ninforming him, for her ready identification in the crowd, that she would\nbe wearing 'my new sprigged-laylock cotton gown,' and Ned gaily\nresponding that, having married her the morning after her arrival, he\nwould make a day of it by taking her to the Exhibition.  One early summer\nafternoon, accordingly, he came from his place of work, and hastened\ntowards Waterloo Station to meet her.  It was as wet and chilly as an\nEnglish June day can occasionally be, but as he waited on the platform in\nthe drizzle he glowed inwardly, and seemed to have something to live for\nagain.\n\nThe 'excursion-train'--an absolutely new departure in the history of\ntravel--was still a novelty on the Wessex line, and probably everywhere.\nCrowds of people had flocked to all the stations on the way up to witness\nthe unwonted sight of so long a train's passage, even where they did not\ntake advantage of the opportunity it offered.  The seats for the humbler\nclass of travellers in these early experiments in steam-locomotion, were\nopen trucks, without any protection whatever from the wind and rain; and\ndamp weather having set in with the afternoon, the unfortunate occupants\nof these vehicles were, on the train drawing up at the London terminus,\nfound to be in a pitiable condition from their long journey; blue-faced,\nstiff-necked, sneezing, rain-beaten, chilled to the marrow, many of the\nmen being hatless; in fact, they resembled people who had been out all\nnight in an open boat on a rough sea, rather than inland excursionists\nfor pleasure.  The women had in some degree protected themselves by\nturning up the skirts of their gowns over their heads, but as by this\narrangement they were additionally exposed about the hips, they were all\nmore or less in a sorry plight.\n\nIn the bustle and crush of alighting forms of both sexes which followed\nthe entry of the huge concatenation into the station, Ned Hipcroft soon\ndiscerned the slim little figure his eye was in search of, in the\nsprigged lilac, as described.  She came up to him with a frightened\nsmile--still pretty, though so damp, weather-beaten, and shivering from\nlong exposure to the wind.\n\n'O Ned!' she sputtered, 'I--I--'  He clasped her in his arms and kissed\nher, whereupon she burst into a flood of tears.\n\n'You are wet, my poor dear!  I hope you'll not get cold,' he said.  And\nsurveying her and her multifarious surrounding packages, he noticed that\nby the hand she led a toddling child--a little girl of three or so--whose\nhood was as clammy and tender face as blue as those of the other\ntravellers.\n\n'Who is this--somebody you know?' asked Ned curiously.\n\n'Yes, Ned.  She's mine.'\n\n'Yours?'\n\n'Yes--my own!'\n\n'Your own child?'\n\n'Yes!'\n\n'Well--as God's in--'\n\n'Ned, I didn't name it in my letter, because, you see, it would have been\nso hard to explain!  I thought that when we met I could tell you how she\nhappened to be born, so much better than in writing!  I hope you'll\nexcuse it this once, dear Ned, and not scold me, now I've come so many,\nmany miles!'\n\n'This means Mr. Mop Ollamoor, I reckon!' said Hipcroft, gazing palely at\nthem from the distance of the yard or two to which he had withdrawn with\na start.\n\nCar'line gasped.  'But he's been gone away for years!' she supplicated.\n'And I never had a young man before!  And I was so onlucky to be catched\nthe first time, though some of the girls down there go on like anything!'\n\nNed remained in silence, pondering.\n\n'You'll forgive me, dear Ned?' she added, beginning to sob outright.  'I\nhaven't taken 'ee in after all, because--because you can pack us back\nagain, if you want to; though 'tis hundreds o' miles, and so wet, and\nnight a-coming on, and I with no money!'\n\n'What the devil can I do!' Hipcroft groaned.\n\nA more pitiable picture than the pair of helpless creatures presented was\nnever seen on a rainy day, as they stood on the great, gaunt, puddled\nplatform, a whiff of drizzle blowing under the roof upon them now and\nthen; the pretty attire in which they had started from Stickleford in the\nearly morning bemuddled and sodden, weariness on their faces, and fear of\nhim in their eyes; for the child began to look as if she thought she too\nhad done some wrong, remaining in an appalled silence till the tears\nrolled down her chubby cheeks.\n\n'What's the matter, my little maid?' said Ned mechanically.\n\n'I do want to go home!' she let out, in tones that told of a bursting\nheart.  'And my totties be cold, an' I shan't have no bread an' butter no\nmore!'\n\n'I don't know what to say to it all!' declared Ned, his own eye moist as\nhe turned and walked a few steps with his head down; then regarded them\nagain point blank.  From the child escaped troubled breaths and silently\nwelling tears.\n\n'Want some bread and butter, do 'ee?' he said, with factitious hardness.\n\n'Ye-e-s!'\n\n'Well, I daresay I can get 'ee a bit!  Naturally, you must want some.  And\nyou, too, for that matter, Car'line.'\n\n'I do feel a little hungered.  But I can keep it off,' she murmured.\n\n'Folk shouldn't do that,' he said gruffly. . . . 'There come along!' he\ncaught up the child, as he added, 'You must bide here to-night, anyhow, I\ns'pose!  What can you do otherwise?  I'll get 'ee some tea and victuals;\nand as for this job, I'm sure I don't know what to say!  This is the way\nout.'\n\nThey pursued their way, without speaking, to Ned's lodgings, which were\nnot far off.  There he dried them and made them comfortable, and prepared\ntea; they thankfully sat down.  The ready-made household of which he\nsuddenly found himself the head imparted a cosy aspect to his room, and a\npaternal one to himself.  Presently he turned to the child and kissed her\nnow blooming cheeks; and, looking wistfully at Car'line, kissed her also.\n\n'I don't see how I can send 'ee back all them miles,' he growled, 'now\nyou've come all the way o' purpose to join me.  But you must trust me,\nCar'line, and show you've real faith in me.  Well, do you feel better\nnow, my little woman?'\n\nThe child nodded, her mouth being otherwise occupied.\n\n'I did trust you, Ned, in coming; and I shall always!'\n\nThus, without any definite agreement to forgive her, he tacitly\nacquiesced in the fate that Heaven had sent him; and on the day of their\nmarriage (which was not quite so soon as he had expected it could be, on\naccount of the time necessary for banns) he took her to the Exhibition\nwhen they came back from church, as he had promised.  While standing near\na large mirror in one of the courts devoted to furniture, Car'line\nstarted, for in the glass appeared the reflection of a form exactly\nresembling Mop Ollamoor's--so exactly, that it seemed impossible to\nbelieve anybody but that artist in person to be the original.  On passing\nround the objects which hemmed in Ned, her, and the child from a direct\nview, no Mop was to be seen.  Whether he were really in London or not at\nthat time was never known; and Car'line always stoutly denied that her\nreadiness to go and meet Ned in town arose from any rumour that Mop had\nalso gone thither; which denial there was no reasonable ground for\ndoubting.\n\nAnd then the year glided away, and the Exhibition folded itself up and\nbecame a thing of the past.  The park trees that had been enclosed for\nsix months were again exposed to the winds and storms, and the sod grew\ngreen anew.  Ned found that Car'line resolved herself into a very good\nwife and companion, though she had made herself what is called cheap to\nhim; but in that she was like another domestic article, a cheap tea-pot,\nwhich often brews better tea than a dear one.  One autumn Hipcroft found\nhimself with but little work to do, and a prospect of less for the\nwinter.  Both being country born and bred, they fancied they would like\nto live again in their natural atmosphere.  It was accordingly decided\nbetween them that they should leave the pent-up London lodging, and that\nNed should seek out employment near his native place, his wife and her\ndaughter staying with Car'line's father during the search for occupation\nand an abode of their own.\n\nTinglings of pleasure pervaded Car'line's spasmodic little frame as she\njourneyed down with Ned to the place she had left two or three years\nbefore, in silence and under a cloud.  To return to where she had once\nbeen despised, a smiling London wife with a distinct London accent, was a\ntriumph which the world did not witness every day.\n\nThe train did not stop at the petty roadside station that lay nearest to\nStickleford, and the trio went on to Casterbridge.  Ned thought it a good\nopportunity to make a few preliminary inquiries for employment at\nworkshops in the borough where he had been known; and feeling cold from\nher journey, and it being dry underfoot and only dusk as yet, with a moon\non the point of rising, Car'line and her little girl walked on toward\nStickleford, leaving Ned to follow at a quicker pace, and pick her up at\na certain half-way house, widely known as an inn.\n\nThe woman and child pursued the well-remembered way comfortably enough,\nthough they were both becoming wearied.  In the course of three miles\nthey had passed Heedless-William's Pond, the familiar landmark by Bloom's\nEnd, and were drawing near the Quiet Woman Inn, a lone roadside hostel on\nthe lower verge of the Egdon Heath, since and for many years abolished.\nIn stepping up towards it Car'line heard more voices within than had\nformerly been customary at such an hour, and she learned that an auction\nof fat stock had been held near the spot that afternoon.  The child would\nbe the better for a rest as well as herself, she thought, and she\nentered.\n\nThe guests and customers overflowed into the passage, and Car'line had no\nsooner crossed the threshold than a man whom she remembered by sight came\nforward with glass and mug in his hands towards a friend leaning against\nthe wall; but, seeing her, very gallantly offered her a drink of the\nliquor, which was gin-and-beer hot, pouring her out a tumblerful and\nsaying, in a moment or two: 'Surely, 'tis little Car'line Aspent that\nwas--down at Stickleford?'\n\nShe assented, and, though she did not exactly want this beverage, she\ndrank it since it was offered, and her entertainer begged her to come in\nfarther and sit down.  Once within the room she found that all the\npersons present were seated close against the walls, and there being a\nchair vacant she did the same.  An explanation of their position occurred\nthe next moment.  In the opposite corner stood Mop, rosining his bow and\nlooking just the same as ever.  The company had cleared the middle of the\nroom for dancing, and they were about to dance again.  As she wore a veil\nto keep off the wind she did not think he had recognized her, or could\npossibly guess the identity of the child; and to her satisfied surprise\nshe found that she could confront him quite calmly--mistress of herself\nin the dignity her London life had given her.  Before she had quite\nemptied her glass the dance was called, the dancers formed in two lines,\nthe music sounded, and the figure began.\n\nThen matters changed for Car'line.  A tremor quickened itself to life in\nher, and her hand so shook that she could hardly set down her glass.  It\nwas not the dance nor the dancers, but the notes of that old violin which\nthrilled the London wife, these having still all the witchery that she\nhad so well known of yore, and under which she had used to lose her power\nof independent will.  How it all came back!  There was the fiddling\nfigure against the wall; the large, oily, mop-like head of him, and\nbeneath the mop the face with closed eyes.\n\nAfter the first moments of paralyzed reverie the familiar tune in the\nfamiliar rendering made her laugh and shed tears simultaneously.  Then a\nman at the bottom of the dance, whose partner had dropped away, stretched\nout his hand and beckoned to her to take the place.  She did not want to\ndance; she entreated by signs to be left where she was, but she was\nentreating of the tune and its player rather than of the dancing man.  The\nsaltatory tendency which the fiddler and his cunning instrument had ever\nbeen able to start in her was seizing Car'line just as it had done in\nearlier years, possibly assisted by the gin-and-beer hot.  Tired as she\nwas she grasped her little girl by the hand, and plunging in at the\nbottom of the figure, whirled about with the rest.  She found that her\ncompanions were mostly people of the neighbouring hamlets and\nfarms--Bloom's End, Mellstock, Lewgate, and elsewhere; and by degrees she\nwas recognized as she convulsively danced on, wishing that Mop would\ncease and let her heart rest from the aching he caused, and her feet\nalso.\n\nAfter long and many minutes the dance ended, when she was urged to\nfortify herself with more gin-and-beer; which she did, feeling very weak\nand overpowered with hysteric emotion.  She refrained from unveiling, to\nkeep Mop in ignorance of her presence, if possible.  Several of the\nguests having left, Car'line hastily wiped her lips and also turned to\ngo; but, according to the account of some who remained, at that very\nmoment a five-handed reel was proposed, in which two or three begged her\nto join.\n\nShe declined on the plea of being tired and having to walk to\nStickleford, when Mop began aggressively tweedling 'My Fancy-Lad,' in D\nmajor, as the air to which the reel was to be footed.  He must have\nrecognized her, though she did not know it, for it was the strain of all\nseductive strains which she was least able to resist--the one he had\nplayed when she was leaning over the bridge at the date of their first\nacquaintance.  Car'line stepped despairingly into the middle of the room\nwith the other four.\n\nReels were resorted to hereabouts at this time by the more robust\nspirits, for the reduction of superfluous energy which the ordinary\nfigure-dances were not powerful enough to exhaust.  As everybody knows,\nor does not know, the five reelers stood in the form of a cross, the reel\nbeing performed by each line of three alternately, the persons who\nsuccessively came to the middle place dancing in both directions.\nCar'line soon found herself in this place, the axis of the whole\nperformance, and could not get out of it, the tune turning into the first\npart without giving her opportunity.  And now she began to suspect that\nMop did know her, and was doing this on purpose, though whenever she\nstole a glance at him his closed eyes betokened obliviousness to\neverything outside his own brain.  She continued to wend her way through\nthe figure of 8 that was formed by her course, the fiddler introducing\ninto his notes the wild and agonizing sweetness of a living voice in one\ntoo highly wrought; its pathos running high and running low in endless\nvariation, projecting through her nerves excruciating spasms, a sort of\nblissful torture.  The room swam, the tune was endless; and in about a\nquarter of an hour the only other woman in the figure dropped out\nexhausted, and sank panting on a bench.\n\nThe reel instantly resolved itself into a four-handed one.  Car'line\nwould have given anything to leave off; but she had, or fancied she had,\nno power, while Mop played such tunes; and thus another ten minutes\nslipped by, a haze of dust now clouding the candles, the floor being of\nstone, sanded.  Then another dancer fell out--one of the men--and went\ninto the passage, in a frantic search for liquor.  To turn the figure\ninto a three-handed reel was the work of a second, Mop modulating at the\nsame time into 'The Fairy Dance,' as better suited to the contracted\nmovement, and no less one of those foods of love which, as manufactured\nby his bow, had always intoxicated her.\n\nIn a reel for three there was no rest whatever, and four or five minutes\nwere enough to make her remaining two partners, now thoroughly blown,\nstamp their last bar and, like their predecessors, limp off into the next\nroom to get something to drink.  Car'line, half-stifled inside her veil,\nwas left dancing alone, the apartment now being empty of everybody save\nherself, Mop, and their little girl.\n\nShe flung up the veil, and cast her eyes upon him, as if imploring him to\nwithdraw himself and his acoustic magnetism from the atmosphere.  Mop\nopened one of his own orbs, as though for the first time, fixed it\npeeringly upon her, and smiling dreamily, threw into his strains the\nreserve of expression which he could not afford to waste on a big and\nnoisy dance.  Crowds of little chromatic subtleties, capable of drawing\ntears from a statue, proceeded straightway from the ancient fiddle, as if\nit were dying of the emotion which had been pent up within it ever since\nits banishment from some Italian city where it first took shape and\nsound.  There was that in the look of Mop's one dark eye which said: 'You\ncannot leave off, dear, whether you would or no!' and it bred in her a\nparoxysm of desperation that defied him to tire her down.\n\nShe thus continued to dance alone, defiantly as she thought, but in truth\nslavishly and abjectly, subject to every wave of the melody, and probed\nby the gimlet-like gaze of her fascinator's open eye; keeping up at the\nsame time a feeble smile in his face, as a feint to signify it was still\nher own pleasure which led her on.  A terrified embarrassment as to what\nshe could say to him if she were to leave off, had its unrecognized share\nin keeping her going.  The child, who was beginning to be distressed by\nthe strange situation, came up and said: 'Stop, mother, stop, and let's\ngo home!' as she seized Car'line's hand.\n\nSuddenly Car'line sank staggering to the floor; and rolling over on her\nface, prone she remained.  Mop's fiddle thereupon emitted an elfin shriek\nof finality; stepping quickly down from the nine-gallon beer-cask which\nhad formed his rostrum, he went to the little girl, who disconsolately\nbent over her mother.\n\nThe guests who had gone into the back-room for liquor and change of air,\nhearing something unusual, trooped back hitherward, where they\nendeavoured to revive poor, weak Car'line by blowing her with the bellows\nand opening the window.  Ned, her husband, who had been detained in\nCasterbridge, as aforesaid, came along the road at this juncture, and\nhearing excited voices through the open casement, and to his great\nsurprise, the mention of his wife's name, he entered amid the rest upon\nthe scene.  Car'line was now in convulsions, weeping violently, and for a\nlong time nothing could be done with her.  While he was sending for a\ncart to take her onward to Stickleford Hipcroft anxiously inquired how it\nhad all happened; and then the assembly explained that a fiddler formerly\nknown in the locality had lately revisited his old haunts, and had taken\nupon himself without invitation to play that evening at the inn.\n\nNed demanded the fiddler's name, and they said Ollamoor.\n\n'Ah!' exclaimed Ned, looking round him.  'Where is he, and where--where's\nmy little girl?'\n\nOllamoor had disappeared, and so had the child.  Hipcroft was in ordinary\na quiet and tractable fellow, but a determination which was to be feared\nsettled in his face now.  'Blast him!' he cried.  'I'll beat his skull in\nfor'n, if I swing for it to-morrow!'\n\nHe had rushed to the poker which lay on the hearth, and hastened down the\npassage, the people following.  Outside the house, on the other side of\nthe highway, a mass of dark heath-land rose sullenly upward to its not\neasily accessible interior, a ravined plateau, whereon jutted into the\nsky, at the distance of a couple of miles, the fir-woods of Mistover\nbacked by the Yalbury coppices--a place of Dantesque gloom at this hour,\nwhich would have afforded secure hiding for a battery of artillery, much\nless a man and a child.\n\nSome other men plunged thitherward with him, and more went along the\nroad.  They were gone about twenty minutes altogether, returning without\nresult to the inn.  Ned sat down in the settle, and clasped his forehead\nwith his hands.\n\n'Well--what a fool the man is, and hev been all these years, if he thinks\nthe child his, as a' do seem to!' they whispered.  'And everybody else\nknowing otherwise!'\n\n'No, I don't think 'tis mine!' cried Ned hoarsely, as he looked up from\nhis hands.  'But she is mine, all the same!  Ha'n't I nussed her?  Ha'n't\nI fed her and teached her?  Ha'n't I played wi' her?  O, little\nCarry--gone with that rogue--gone!'\n\n'You ha'n't lost your mis'ess, anyhow,' they said to console him.  'She's\nthrowed up the sperrits, and she is feeling better, and she's more to 'ee\nthan a child that isn't yours.'\n\n'She isn't!  She's not so particular much to me, especially now she's\nlost the little maid!  But Carry's everything!'\n\n'Well, ver' like you'll find her to-morrow.'\n\n'Ah--but shall I?  Yet he _can't_ hurt her--surely he can't!  Well--how's\nCar'line now?  I am ready.  Is the cart here?'\n\nShe was lifted into the vehicle, and they sadly lumbered on toward\nStickleford.  Next day she was calmer; but the fits were still upon her;\nand her will seemed shattered.  For the child she appeared to show\nsingularly little anxiety, though Ned was nearly distracted.  It was\nnevertheless quite expected that the impish Mop would restore the lost\none after a freak of a day or two; but time went on, and neither he nor\nshe could be heard of, and Hipcroft murmured that perhaps he was\nexercising upon her some unholy musical charm, as he had done upon\nCar'line herself.  Weeks passed, and still they could obtain no clue\neither to the fiddler's whereabouts or the girl's; and how he could have\ninduced her to go with him remained a mystery.\n\nThen Ned, who had obtained only temporary employment in the\nneighbourhood, took a sudden hatred toward his native district, and a\nrumour reaching his ears through the police that a somewhat similar man\nand child had been seen at a fair near London, he playing a violin, she\ndancing on stilts, a new interest in the capital took possession of\nHipcroft with an intensity which would scarcely allow him time to pack\nbefore returning thither.\n\nHe did not, however, find the lost one, though he made it the entire\nbusiness of his over-hours to stand about in by-streets in the hope of\ndiscovering her, and would start up in the night, saying, 'That rascal's\ntorturing her to maintain him!'  To which his wife would answer\npeevishly, 'Don't 'ee raft yourself so, Ned!  You prevent my getting a\nbit o' rest!  He won't hurt her!' and fall asleep again.\n\nThat Carry and her father had emigrated to America was the general\nopinion; Mop, no doubt, finding the girl a highly desirable companion\nwhen he had trained her to keep him by her earnings as a dancer.  There,\nfor that matter, they may be performing in some capacity now, though he\nmust be an old scamp verging on threescore-and-ten, and she a woman of\nfour-and-forty.\n\n","“SHE said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,” cried\nthe young Student; “but in all my garden there is no red rose.”\n\nFrom her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she\nlooked out through the leaves, and wondered.\n\n“No red rose in all my garden!” he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled\nwith tears.  “Ah, on what little things does happiness depend!  I have\nread all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of\nphilosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made\nwretched.”\n\n“Here at last is a true lover,” said the Nightingale.  “Night after night\nhave I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told\nhis story to the stars, and now I see him.  His hair is dark as the\nhyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but\npassion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal\nupon his brow.”\n\n“The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,” murmured the young Student,\n“and my love will be of the company.  If I bring her a red rose she will\ndance with me till dawn.  If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in\nmy arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will\nbe clasped in mine.  But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall\nsit lonely, and she will pass me by.  She will have no heed of me, and my\nheart will break.”\n\n“Here indeed is the true lover,” said the Nightingale.  “What I sing of,\nhe suffers—what is joy to me, to him is pain.  Surely Love is a wonderful\nthing.  It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.\nPearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the\nmarketplace.  It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be\nweighed out in the balance for gold.”\n\n“The musicians will sit in their gallery,” said the young Student, “and\nplay upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound\nof the harp and the violin.  She will dance so lightly that her feet will\nnot touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng\nround her.  But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to\ngive her”; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in\nhis hands, and wept.\n\n“Why is he weeping?” asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with\nhis tail in the air.\n\n“Why, indeed?” said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a\nsunbeam.\n\n“Why, indeed?” whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.\n\n“He is weeping for a red rose,” said the Nightingale.\n\n“For a red rose?” they cried; “how very ridiculous!” and the little\nLizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.\n\nBut the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student’s sorrow, and\nshe sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.\n\nSuddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.\nShe passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed\nacross the garden.\n\nIn the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and\nwhen she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.\n\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\n\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\n“My roses are white,” it answered; “as white as the foam of the sea, and\nwhiter than the snow upon the mountain.  But go to my brother who grows\nround the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.”\n\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the\nold sun-dial.\n\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\n\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\n“My roses are yellow,” it answered; “as yellow as the hair of the\nmermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil\nthat blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.  But go\nto my brother who grows beneath the Student’s window, and perhaps he will\ngive you what you want.”\n\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath\nthe Student’s window.\n\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\n\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\n“My roses are red,” it answered, “as red as the feet of the dove, and\nredder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the\nocean-cavern.  But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has\nnipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no\nroses at all this year.”\n\n“One red rose is all I want,” cried the Nightingale, “only one red rose!\nIs there no way by which I can get it?”\n\n“There is a way,” answered the Tree; “but it is so terrible that I dare\nnot tell it to you.”\n\n“Tell it to me,” said the Nightingale, “I am not afraid.”\n\n“If you want a red rose,” said the Tree, “you must build it out of music\nby moonlight, and stain it with your own heart’s-blood.  You must sing to\nme with your breast against a thorn.  All night long you must sing to me,\nand the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into\nmy veins, and become mine.”\n\n“Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,” cried the Nightingale,\n“and Life is very dear to all.  It is pleasant to sit in the green wood,\nand to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot\nof pearl.  Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the\nbluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the\nhill.  Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird\ncompared to the heart of a man?”\n\nSo she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.  She\nswept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through\nthe grove.\n\nThe young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him,\nand the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.\n\n“Be happy,” cried the Nightingale, “be happy; you shall have your red\nrose.  I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my\nown heart’s-blood.  All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a\ntrue lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and\nmightier than Power, though he is mighty.  Flame-coloured are his wings,\nand coloured like flame is his body.  His lips are sweet as honey, and\nhis breath is like frankincense.”\n\nThe Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not\nunderstand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the\nthings that are written down in books.\n\nBut the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the\nlittle Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.\n\n“Sing me one last song,” he whispered; “I shall feel very lonely when you\nare gone.”\n\nSo the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water\nbubbling from a silver jar.\n\nWhen she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book\nand a lead-pencil out of his pocket.\n\n“She has form,” he said to himself, as he walked away through the\ngrove—“that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?  I am\nafraid not.  In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without\nany sincerity.  She would not sacrifice herself for others.  She thinks\nmerely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.  Still,\nit must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.  What\na pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.”\nAnd he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and\nbegan to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.\n\nAnd when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the\nRose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.  All night long she sang\nwith her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down\nand listened.  All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and\ndeeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.\n\nShe sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.\nAnd on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous\nrose, petal following petal, as song followed song.  Pale was it, at\nfirst, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the\nmorning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.  As the shadow of a rose in\na mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the\nrose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.\n\nBut the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.\n“Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day will come\nbefore the rose is finished.”\n\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and\nlouder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of\na man and a maid.\n\nAnd a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the\nflush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.\nBut the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose’s heart remained\nwhite, for only a Nightingale’s heart’s-blood can crimson the heart of a\nrose.\n\nAnd the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.\n“Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day will come\nbefore the rose is finished.”\n\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn\ntouched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.  Bitter,\nbitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of\nthe Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the\ntomb.\n\nAnd the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.\nCrimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.\n\nBut the Nightingale’s voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to\nbeat, and a film came over her eyes.  Fainter and fainter grew her song,\nand she felt something choking her in her throat.\n\nThen she gave one last burst of music.  The white Moon heard it, and she\nforgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.  The red rose heard it, and\nit trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold\nmorning air.  Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke\nthe sleeping shepherds from their dreams.  It floated through the reeds\nof the river, and they carried its message to the sea.\n\n“Look, look!” cried the Tree, “the rose is finished now”; but the\nNightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass,\nwith the thorn in her heart.\n\nAnd at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.\n\n“Why, what a wonderful piece of luck!” he cried; “here is a red rose!  I\nhave never seen any rose like it in all my life.  It is so beautiful that\nI am sure it has a long Latin name”; and he leaned down and plucked it.\n\nThen he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor’s house with the rose\nin his hand.\n\nThe daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue\nsilk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.\n\n“You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,”\ncried the Student.  “Here is the reddest rose in all the world.  You will\nwear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell\nyou how I love you.”\n\nBut the girl frowned.\n\n“I am afraid it will not go with my dress,” she answered; “and, besides,\nthe Chamberlain’s nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody\nknows that jewels cost far more than flowers.”\n\n“Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,” said the Student angrily;\nand he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and\na cart-wheel went over it.\n\n“Ungrateful!” said the girl.  “I tell you what, you are very rude; and,\nafter all, who are you?  Only a Student.  Why, I don’t believe you have\neven got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain’s nephew has”;\nand she got up from her chair and went into the house.\n\n“What a silly thing Love is,” said the Student as he walked away.  “It\nis not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is\nalways telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one\nbelieve things that are not true.  In fact, it is quite unpractical, and,\nas in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to\nPhilosophy and study Metaphysics.”\n\nSo he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began\nto read.\n\n","Article 1601: General Principles\nFurther to Article 102 (Objectives), this Chapter reflects the preferential trading relationship between the Parties, the desirability of facilitating temporary entry on a reciprocal basis and of establishing transparent criteria and procedures for temporary entry, and the need to ensure border security and to protect the domestic labor force and permanent employment in their respective territories.\nArticle 1602: General Obligations\n1.

He had\nbright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long\nbit of black india-rubber.  The little ducks were swimming about in the\npond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who\nwas pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand\non their heads in the water.\n\n“You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your\nheads,” she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them\nhow it was done.  But the little ducks paid no attention to her.  They\nwere so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in\nsociety at all.\n\n“What disobedient children!” cried the old Water-rat; “they really\ndeserve to be drowned.”\n\n“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, “every one must make a\nbeginning, and parents cannot be too patient.”\n\n“Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,” said the Water-rat;\n“I am not a family man.  In fact, I have never been married, and I never\nintend to be.  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much\nhigher.  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or\nrarer than a devoted friendship.”\n\n“And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?” asked a\nGreen Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard\nthe conversation.\n\n“Yes, that is just what I want to know,” said the Duck; and she swam away\nto the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her\nchildren a good example.\n\n“What a silly question!” cried the Water-rat.  “I should expect my\ndevoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.”\n\n“And what would you do in return?” said the little bird, swinging upon a\nsilver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.\n\n“I don’t understand you,” answered the Water-rat.\n\n“Let me tell you a story on the subject,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Is the story about me?” asked the Water-rat.  “If so, I will listen to\nit, for I am extremely fond of fiction.”\n\n“It is applicable to you,” answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and\nalighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.\n\n“Once upon a time,” said the Linnet, “there was an honest little fellow\nnamed Hans.”\n\n“Was he very distinguished?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“No,” answered the Linnet, “I don’t think he was distinguished at all,\nexcept for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.  He\nlived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his\ngarden.  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.\nSweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds’-purses, and\nFair-maids of France.  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac\nCrocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white.  Columbine and Ladysmock,\nMarjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil\nand the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the\nmonths went by, one flower taking another flower’s place, so that there\nwere always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.\n\n“Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all\nwas big Hugh the Miller.  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to\nlittle Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over\nthe wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or\nfilling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.\n\n“‘Real friends should have everything in common,’ the Miller used to say,\nand little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend\nwith such noble ideas.\n\n“Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich\nMiller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred\nsacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large\nflock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these\nthings, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the\nwonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true\nfriendship.\n\n“So little Hans worked away in his garden.  During the spring, the\nsummer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and\nhe had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good\ndeal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper\nbut a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  In the winter, also, he was\nextremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.\n\n“‘There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow\nlasts,’ the Miller used to say to his wife, ‘for when people are in\ntrouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.  That\nat least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.  So I\nshall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and\nhe will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make\nhim so happy.’\n\n“‘You are certainly very thoughtful about others,’ answered the Wife, as\nshe sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; ‘very\nthoughtful indeed.  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about\nfriendship.  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful\nthings as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear\na gold ring on his little finger.’\n\n“‘But could we not ask little Hans up here?’ said the Miller’s youngest\nson.  ‘If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and\nshow him my white rabbits.’\n\n“‘What a silly boy you are!’ cried the Miller; ‘I really don’t know what\nis the use of sending you to school.  You seem not to learn anything.\nWhy, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good\nsupper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is\na most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody’s nature.  I certainly\nwill not allow Hans’ nature to be spoiled.  I am his best friend, and I\nwill always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any\ntemptations.  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have\nsome flour on credit, and that I could not do.  Flour is one thing, and\nfriendship is another, and they should not be confused.  Why, the words\nare spelt differently, and mean quite different things.  Everybody can\nsee that.’\n\n“‘How well you talk!’ said the Miller’s Wife, pouring herself out a large\nglass of warm ale; ‘really I feel quite drowsy.  It is just like being in\nchurch.’\n\n“‘Lots of people act well,’ answered the Miller; ‘but very few people\ntalk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of\nthe two, and much the finer thing also’; and he looked sternly across the\ntable at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his\nhead down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.\nHowever, he was so young that you must excuse him.”\n\n“Is that the end of the story?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Certainly not,” answered the Linnet, “that is the beginning.”\n\n“Then you are quite behind the age,” said the Water-rat.  “Every good\nstory-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the\nbeginning, and concludes with the middle.  That is the new method.  I\nheard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the\npond with a young man.  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am\nsure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head,\nand whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered ‘Pooh!’\nBut pray go on with your story.  I like the Miller immensely.  I have all\nkinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy\nbetween us.”\n\n“Well,” said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, “as\nsoon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale\nyellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see\nlittle Hans.\n\n“‘Why, what a good heart you have!’ cried his Wife; ‘you are always\nthinking of others.  And mind you take the big basket with you for the\nflowers.’\n\n“So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron\nchain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.\n\n“‘Good morning, little Hans,’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Good morning,’ said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to\near.\n\n“‘And how have you been all the winter?’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ cried Hans, ‘it is very good of you to ask, very good\nindeed.  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring\nhas come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.’\n\n“‘We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘and\nwondered how you were getting on.’\n\n“‘That was kind of you,’ said Hans; ‘I was half afraid you had forgotten\nme.’\n\n“‘Hans, I am surprised at you,’ said the Miller; ‘friendship never\nforgets.  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don’t\nunderstand the poetry of life.  How lovely your primroses are looking,\nby-the-bye!”\n\n“‘They are certainly very lovely,’ said Hans, ‘and it is a most lucky\nthing for me that I have so many.  I am going to bring them into the\nmarket and sell them to the Burgomaster’s daughter, and buy back my\nwheelbarrow with the money.’\n\n“‘Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don’t mean to say you have sold it?\nWhat a very stupid thing to do!’\n\n“‘Well, the fact is,’ said Hans, ‘that I was obliged to.  You see the\nwinter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to\nbuy bread with.  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat,\nand then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last\nI sold my wheelbarrow.  But I am going to buy them all back again now.’\n\n“‘Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘I will give you my wheelbarrow.  It is not in\nvery good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong\nwith the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.  I\nknow it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me\nextremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the\nworld.  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and,\nbesides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.  Yes, you may set your\nmind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.’\n\n“‘Well, really, that is generous of you,’ said little Hans, and his funny\nround face glowed all over with pleasure.  ‘I can easily put it in\nrepair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.’\n\n“‘A plank of wood!’ said the Miller; ‘why, that is just what I want for\nthe roof of my barn.  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will\nall get damp if I don’t stop it up.  How lucky you mentioned it!  It is\nquite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.  I have given\nyou my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.  Of\ncourse, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true,\nfriendship never notices things like that.  Pray get it at once, and I\nwill set to work at my barn this very day.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the\nplank out.\n\n“‘It is not a very big plank,’ said the Miller, looking at it, ‘and I am\nafraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won’t be any left for\nyou to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault.\nAnd now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to\ngive me some flowers in return.  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it\nquite full.’\n\n“‘Quite full?’ said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a\nvery big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no\nflowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver\nbuttons back.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘as I have given you my\nwheelbarrow, I don’t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.\nI may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true\nfriendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.’\n\n“‘My dear friend, my best friend,’ cried little Hans, ‘you are welcome to\nall the flowers in my garden.  I would much sooner have your good opinion\nthan my silver buttons, any day’; and he ran and plucked all his pretty\nprimroses, and filled the Miller’s basket.\n\n“‘Good-bye, little Hans,’ said the Miller, as he went up the hill with\nthe plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.\n\n“‘Good-bye,’ said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he\nwas so pleased about the wheelbarrow.\n\n“The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when\nhe heard the Miller’s voice calling to him from the road.  So he jumped\noff the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.\n\n“There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘would you mind carrying this sack\nof flour for me to market?’\n\n“‘Oh, I am so sorry,’ said Hans, ‘but I am really very busy to-day.  I\nhave got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all\nmy grass to roll.’\n\n“‘Well, really,’ said the Miller, ‘I think that, considering that I am\ngoing to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to\nrefuse.’\n\n“‘Oh, don’t say that,’ cried little Hans, ‘I wouldn’t be unfriendly for\nthe whole world’; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big\nsack on his shoulders.\n\n“It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans\nhad reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down\nand rest.  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the\nmarket.  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour\nfor a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was\nafraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.\n\n“‘It has certainly been a hard day,’ said little Hans to himself as he\nwas going to bed, ‘but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is\nmy best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.’\n\n“Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his\nsack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.\n\n“‘Upon my word,’ said the Miller, ‘you are very lazy.  Really,\nconsidering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might\nwork harder.  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don’t like any of\nmy friends to be idle or sluggish.  You must not mind my speaking quite\nplainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not\nyour friend.  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say\nexactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to\nplease and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things,\nand does not mind giving pain.  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he\nprefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off\nhis night-cap, ‘but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for\na little time, and listen to the birds singing.  Do you know that I\nalways work better after hearing the birds sing?’\n\n“‘Well, I am glad of that,’ said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the\nback, ‘for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed,\nand mend my barn-roof for me.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his\nflowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse\nthe Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.\n\n“‘Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?’ he\ninquired in a shy and timid voice.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘I do not think it is much to ask\nof you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of\ncourse if you refuse I will go and do it myself.’\n\n“‘Oh! on no account,’ cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and\ndressed himself, and went up to the barn.\n\n“He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came\nto see how he was getting on.\n\n“‘Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?’ cried the\nMiller in a cheery voice.\n\n“‘It is quite mended,’ answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.\n\n“‘Ah!’ said the Miller, ‘there is no work so delightful as the work one\ndoes for others.’\n\n“‘It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,’ answered little\nHans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, ‘a very great privilege.\nBut I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.’\n\n“‘Oh! they will come to you,’ said the Miller, ‘but you must take more\npains.  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you\nwill have the theory also.’\n\n“‘Do you really think I shall?’ asked little Hans.\n\n“‘I have no doubt of it,’ answered the Miller, ‘but now that you have\nmended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive\nmy sheep to the mountain to-morrow.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next\nmorning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans\nstarted off with them to the mountain.  It took him the whole day to get\nthere and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to\nsleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.\n\n“‘What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,’ he said, and he went\nto work at once.\n\n“But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his\nfriend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long\nerrands, or getting him to help at the mill.  Little Hans was very much\ndistressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had\nforgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller\nwas his best friend.  ‘Besides,’ he used to say, ‘he is going to give me\nhis wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.’\n\n“So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds\nof beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a\nnote-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good\nscholar.\n\n“Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside\nwhen a loud rap came at the door.  It was a very wild night, and the wind\nwas blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he\nthought it was merely the storm.  But a second rap came, and then a\nthird, louder than any of the others.\n\n“‘It is some poor traveller,’ said little Hans to himself, and he ran to\nthe door.\n\n“There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the\nother.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ cried the Miller, ‘I am in great trouble.  My little\nboy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the\nDoctor.  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it\nhas just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead\nof me.  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is\nonly fair that you should do something for me in return.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, ‘I take it quite as a compliment your\ncoming to me, and I will start off at once.  But you must lend me your\nlantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the\nditch.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ answered the Miller, ‘but it is my new lantern, and\nit would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.’\n\n“‘Well, never mind, I will do without it,’ cried little Hans, and he took\ndown his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler\nround his throat, and started off.\n\n“What a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans\ncould hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely\nstand.  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking\nabout three hours, he arrived at the Doctor’s house, and knocked at the\ndoor.\n\n“‘Who is there?’ cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom\nwindow.\n\n“‘Little Hans, Doctor.’\n\n“’What do you want, little Hans?’\n\n“‘The Miller’s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and\nthe Miller wants you to come at once.’\n\n“‘All right!’ said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big\nboots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the\ndirection of the Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him.\n\n“But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and\nlittle Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.\nAt last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very\ndangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans\nwas drowned.  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating\nin a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.\n\n“Everybody went to little Hans’ funeral, as he was so popular, and the\nMiller was the chief mourner.\n\n“‘As I was his best friend,’ said the Miller, ‘it is only fair that I\nshould have the best place’; so he walked at the head of the procession\nin a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a\nbig pocket-handkerchief.\n\n“‘Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,’ said the\nBlacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated\ncomfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.\n\n“‘A great loss to me at any rate,’ answered the Miller; ‘why, I had as\ngood as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don’t know what to do\nwith it.  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair\nthat I could not get anything for it if I sold it.  I will certainly take\ncare not to give away anything again.  One always suffers for being\ngenerous.’”\n\n“Well?” said the Water-rat, after a long pause.\n\n“Well, that is the end,” said the Linnet.\n\n“But what became of the Miller?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Oh!  I really don’t know,” replied the Linnet; “and I am sure that I\ndon’t care.”\n\n“It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,” said\nthe Water-rat.\n\n“I am afraid you don’t quite see the moral of the story,” remarked the\nLinnet.\n\n“The what?” screamed the Water-rat.\n\n“The moral.”\n\n“Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?”\n\n“Certainly,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Well, really,” said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, “I think you\nshould have told me that before you began.  If you had done so, I\ncertainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said\n‘Pooh,’ like the critic.  However, I can say it now”; so he shouted out\n“Pooh” at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back\ninto his hole.\n\n“And how do you like the Water-rat?” asked the Duck, who came paddling up\nsome minutes afterwards.  “He has a great many good points, but for my\nown part I have a mother’s feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed\nbachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.”\n\n“I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,” answered the Linnet.  “The\nfact is, that I told him a story with a moral.”\n\n“Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,” said the Duck.\n\nAnd I quite agree with her.\n\n","Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the 104th Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans all across our land: Let me begin tonight by saying to our men and women in uniform around the world, and especially those helping peace take root in Bosnia and to their families, I thank you. America is very, very proud of you.\nMy duty tonight is to report on the state of the Union, not the state of our Government but of our American community, and to set forth our responsibilities, in the words of our Founders, to form a more perfect Union.\nThe state of the Union is strong. Our economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades. We have the lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years. We have completed—created nearly 8 million new jobs, over a million of them in basic industries like construction and automobiles. America is selling more cars than Japan for the first time since the 1970's. And for 3 years in a row, we have had a record number of new businesses started in our country.\nOur leadership in the world is also strong, bringing hope for new peace. And perhaps most important, we are gaining ground in restoring our fundamental values. The crime rate, the welfare and food stamp rolls, the poverty rate, and the teen pregnancy rate are all down. And as they go down, prospects for America's future go up.\nWe live in an age of possibility. A hundred years ago we moved from farm to factory. Now we move to an age of technology, information, and global competition. These changes have opened vast new opportunities for our people, but they have also presented them with stiff challenges. While more Americans are living better, too many of our fellow citizens are working harder just to keep up, and they are rightly concerned about the security of their families.\nWe must answer here three fundamental questions: First, how do we make the American dream of opportunity for all a reality for all Americans who are willing to work for it? Second, how do we preserve our old and enduring values as we move into the future? And third, how do we meet these challenges together, as one America?\nWe know big Government does not have all the answers. We know there's not a program for every problem. We know, and we have worked to give the American people a smaller, less bureaucratic Government in Washington. And we have to give the American people one that lives within its means. The era of big Government is over. But we cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves.\nInstead, we must go forward as one America, one nation working together to meet the challenges we face together. Self-reliance and teamwork are not opposing virtues; we must have both. I believe our new, smaller Government must work in an old-fashioned American way, together with all of our citizens through State and local governments, in the workplace, in religious, charitable, and civic associations. Our goal must be to enable all our people to make the most of their own lives, with stronger families, more educational opportunity, economic security, safer streets, a cleaner environment in a safer world.\nTo improve the state of our Union, we must ask more of ourselves, we must expect more of each other, and we must face our challenges together.\nHere, in this place, our responsibility begins with balancing the budget in a way that is fair to all Americans. There is now broad bipartisan agreement that permanent deficit spending must come to an end.\nI compliment the Republican leadership and the membership for the energy and determination you have brought to this task of balancing the budget. And I thank the Democrats for passing the largest deficit reduction plan in history in 1993, which has already cut the deficit nearly in half in 3 years.\nSince 1993, we have all begun to see the benefits of deficit reduction. Lower interest rates have made it easier for businesses to borrow and to invest and to create new jobs. Lower interest rates have brought down the cost of home mortgages, car payments, and credit card rates to ordinary citizens. Now, it is time to finish the job and balance the budget.\nThough differences remain among us which are significant, the combined total of the proposed savings that are common to both plans is more than enough, using the numbers from your Congressional Budget Office to balance the budget in 7 years and to provide a modest tax cut.\nThese cuts are real. They will require sacrifice from everyone. But these cuts do not undermine our fundamental obligations to our parents, our children, and our future, by endangering Medicare or Medicaid or education or the environment or by raising taxes on working families.\nI have said before, and let me say again, many good ideas have come out of our negotiations. I have learned a lot about the way both Republicans and Democrats view the debate before us. I have learned a lot about the good ideas that each side has that we could all embrace.\nWe ought to resolve our remaining differences. I am willing to work to resolve them. I am ready to meet tomorrow. But I ask you to consider that we should at least enact these savings that both plans have in common and give the American people their balanced budget, a tax cut, lower interest rates, and a brighter future. We should do that now and make permanent deficits yesterday's legacy.\nNow it is time for us to look also to the challenges of today and tomorrow, beyond the burdens of yesterday. The challenges are significant. But our Nation was built on challenges. America was built on challenges, not promises. And when we work together to meet them, we never fail. That is the key to a more perfect Union. Our individual dreams must be realized by our common efforts.\nTonight I want to speak to you about the challenges we all face as a people. Our first challenge is to cherish our children and strengthen America's families. Family is the foundation of American life. If we have stronger families, we will have a stronger America.\nBefore I go on, I'd like to take just a moment to thank my own family, and to thank the person who has taught me more than anyone else over 25 years about the importance of families and children, a wonderful wife, a magnificent mother, and a great First Lady. Thank you, Hillary.\nAll strong families begin with taking more responsibility for our children. I've heard Mrs. Gore say that it's hard to be a parent today, but it's even harder to be a child. So all of us, not just as parents but all of us in our other roles—our media, our schools, our teachers, our communities, our churches and synagogues, our businesses, our governments—all of us have a responsibility to help our children to make it and to make the most of their lives and their God-given capacities.\nTo the media, I say you should create movies and CD's and television shows you'd want your own children and grandchildren to enjoy.\nI call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V-chip in TV sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for their children. When parents control what their young children see, that is not censorship; that is enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their children's upbringing. And I urge them to do it. The V-chip requirement is part of the important telecommunications bill now pending in this Congress. It has bipartisan support, and I urge you to pass it now.\nTo make the V-chip work, I challenge the broadcast industry to do what movies have done, to identify your program in ways that help parents to protect their children. And I invite the leaders of major media corporations in the entertainment industry to come to the White House next month to work with us in a positive way on concrete ways to improve what our children see on television. I am ready to work with you.\nI say to those who make and market cigarettes, every year a million children take up smoking, even though it's against the law. Three hundred thousand of them will have their lives shortened as a result. Our administration has taken steps to stop the massive marketing campaigns that appeal to our children. We are simply saying: Market your products to adults, if you wish, but draw the line on children.\nI say to those who are on welfare, and especially to those who have been trapped on welfare for a long time: For too long our welfare system has undermined the values of family and work, instead of supporting them. The Congress and I are near agreement on sweeping welfare reform. We agree on time limits, tough work requirements, and the toughest possible child support enforcement. But I believe we must also provide child care so that mothers who are required to go to work can do so without worrying about what is happening to their children.\nI challenge this Congress to send me a bipartisan welfare reform bill that will really move people from welfare to work and do the right thing by our children. I will sign it immediately.\nLet us be candid about this difficult problem. Passing a law, even the best possible law, is only a first step. The next step is to make it work. I challenge people on welfare to make the most of this opportunity for independence. I challenge American businesses to give people on welfare the chance to move into the work force. I applaud the work of religious groups and others who care for the poor. More than anyone else in our society, they know the true difficulty of the task before us, and they are in a position to help.\nEvery one of us should join them. That is the only way we can make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the American people.\nTo strengthen the family we must do everything we can to keep the teen pregnancy rate going down. I am gratified, as I'm sure all Americans are, that it has dropped for 2 years in a row. But we all know it is still far too high.\nTonight I am pleased to announce that a group of prominent Americans is responding to that challenge by forming an organization that will support grassroots community efforts all across our country in a national campaign against teen pregnancy. And I challenge all of us and every American to join their efforts.\nI call on American men and women in families to give greater respect to one another. We must end the deadly scourge of domestic violence in our country. And I challenge America's families to work harder to stay together. For families who stay together not only do better economically, their children do better as well.\nIn particular, I challenge the fathers of this country to love and care for their children. If your family has separated, you must pay your child support. We're doing more than ever to make sure you do, and we're going to do more. But let's all admit something about that, too: A check will not substitute for a parent's love and guidance. And only you—only you can make the decision to help raise your children. No matter who you are, how low or high your station in life, it is the most basic human duty of every American to do that job to the best of his or her ability.\nOur second challenge is to provide Americans with the educational opportunities we'll all need for this new century. In our schools, every classroom in America must be connected to the information superhighway, with computers and good software and well-trained teachers. We are working with the telecommunications industry, educators, and parents to connect 20 percent of California's classrooms by this spring, and every classroom and every library in the entire United States by the year 2000. I ask Congress to support this education technology initiative so that we can make sure this national partnership succeeds.\nEvery diploma ought to mean something. I challenge every community, every school, and every State to adopt national standards of excellence, to measure whether schools are meeting those standards, to cut bureaucratic redtape so that schools and teachers have more flexibility for grassroots reform, and to hold them accountable for results. That's what our Goals 2000 initiative is all about. I challenge every State to give all parents the right to choose which public school their children will attend, and to let teachers form new schools with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job.\nI challenge all our schools to teach character education, to teach good values and good citizenship. And if it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms.\nI challenge our parents to become their children's first teachers. Turn off the TV. See that the homework is done. And visit your children's classroom. No program, no teacher, no one else can do that for you.\nMy fellow Americans, higher education is more important today than ever before. We've created a new student loan program that's made it easier to borrow and repay those loans, and we have dramatically cut the student loan default rate. That's something we should all be proud of because it was unconscionably high just a few years ago.\nThrough AmeriCorps, our national service program, this year 25,000 young people will earn college money by serving their local communities to improve the lives of their friends and neighbors.\nThese initiatives are right for America, and we should keep them going. And we should also work hard to open the doors of college even wider. I challenge Congress to expand work-study and help one million young Americans work their way through college by the year 2000, to provide a $1,000 merit scholarship for the top 5 percent of graduates in every high school in the United States, to expand Pell Grant scholarships for deserving and needy students, and to make up to $10,000 a year of college tuition tax deductible. It's a good idea for America.\nOur third challenge is to help every American who is willing to work for it, achieve economic security in this new age. People who work hard still need support to get ahead in the new economy. They need education and training for a lifetime. They need more support for families raising children. They need retirement security. They need access to health care. More and more Americans are finding that the education of their childhood simply doesn't last a lifetime.\nSo I challenge Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping, antiquated job-training programs into a simple voucher worth $2,600 for unemployed or underemployed workers to use as they please for community college tuition or other training. This is a \"GI bill\" for America's workers we should all be able to agree on.\nMore and more Americans are working hard without a raise. Congress sets the minimum wage. Within a year, the minimum wage will fall to a 40-year low in purchasing power. Four dollars and 25 cents an hour is no longer a minimum wage, but millions of Americans and their children are trying to live on it. I challenge you to raise their minimum wage.\nIn 1993, Congress cut the taxes of 15 million hard-pressed working families to make sure that no parents who work full-time would have to raise their children in poverty and to encourage people to move from welfare to work. This expanded earned-income tax credit is now worth about $1,800 a year to a family of four living on $20,000. The budget bill I vetoed would have reversed this achievement and raised taxes on nearly 8 million of these people. We should not do that. We should not do that.\nI also agree that the people who are helped under this initiative are not all those in our country who are working hard to do a good job raising their children and at work. I agree that we need a tax credit for working families with children. That's one of the things most of us in this Chamber, I hope, can agree on. I know it is strongly supported by the Republican majority. And it should be part of any final budget agreement.\nI want to challenge every business that can possibly afford it to provide pensions for your employees. And I challenge Congress to pass a proposal recommended by the White House Conference on Small Business that would make it easier for small businesses and farmers to establish their own pension plans. That is something we should all agree on.\nWe should also protect existing pension plans. Two years ago, with bipartisan support that was almost unanimous on both sides of the aisle, we moved to protect the pensions of 8 million working people and to stabilize the pensions of 32 million more. Congress should not now let companies endanger those workers' pension funds.\nI know the proposal to liberalize the ability of employers to take money out of pension funds for other purposes would raise money for the Treasury. But I believe it is false economy. I vetoed that proposal last year, and I would have to do so again.\nFinally, if our working families are going to succeed in the new economy, they must be able to buy health insurance policies that they do not lose when they change jobs or when someone in their family gets sick. Over the past 2 years, over one million Americans in working families have lost their health insurance. We have to do more to make health care available to every American. And Congress should start by passing the bipartisan bill sponsored by Senator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum that would require insurance companies to stop dropping people when they switch jobs and stop denying coverage for preexisting conditions. Let's all do that.\nAnd even as we enact savings in these programs, we must have a common commitment to preserve the basic protections of Medicare and Medicaid, not just to the poor but to people in working families, including children, people with disabilities, people with AIDS, senior citizens in nursing homes.\nIn the past 3 years, we've saved $15 billion just by fighting health care fraud and abuse. We have all agreed to save much more. We have all agreed to stabilize the Medicare Trust Fund. But we must not abandon our fundamental obligations to the people who need Medicare and Medicaid. America cannot become stronger if they become weaker.\nThe \"GI bill\" for workers, tax relief for education and child rearing, pension availability and protection, access to health care, preservation of Medicare and Medicaid, these things, along with the Family and Medical Leave Act passed in 1993, these things will help responsible, hard-working American families to make the most of their own lives.\nBut employers and employees must do their part, as well, as they are doing in so many of our finest companies, working together, putting the long-term prosperity ahead of the short-term gain. As workers increase their hours and their productivity, employers should make sure they get the skills they need and share the benefits of the good years, as well as the burdens of the bad ones. When companies and workers work as a team they do better, and so does America.\nOur fourth great challenge is to take our streets back from crime and gangs and drugs. At last we have begun to find a way to reduce crime, forming community partnerships with local police forces to catch criminals and prevent crime. This strategy, called community policing, is clearly working. Violent crime is coming down all across America. In New York City murders are down 25 percent, in St. Louis, 18 percent, in Seattle, 32 percent. But we still have a long way to go before our streets are safe and our people are free from fear.\nThe crime bill of 1994 is critical to the success of community policing. It provides funds for 100,000 new police in communities of all sizes. We're already a third of the way there. And I challenge the Congress to finish the job. Let us stick with a strategy that's working and keep the crime rate coming down.\nCommunity policing also requires bonds of trust between citizens and police. I ask all Americans to respect and support our law enforcement officers. And to our police, I say, our children need you as role models and heroes. Don't let them down.\nThe Brady bill has already stopped 44,000 people with criminal records from buying guns. The assault weapons ban is keeping 19 kinds of assault weapons out of the hands of violent gangs. I challenge the Congress to keep those laws on the books.\nOur next step in the fight against crime is to take on gangs the way we once took on the mob. I'm directing the FBI and other investigative agencies to target gangs that involve juveniles and violent crime, and to seek authority to prosecute as adults teenagers who maim and kill like adults.\nAnd I challenge local housing authorities and tenant associations: Criminal gang members and drug dealers are destroying the lives of decent tenants. From now on, the rule for residents who commit crime and pedal drugs should be one strike and you're out.\nI challenge every State to match Federal policy to assure that serious violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentence.\nMore police and punishment are important, but they're not enough. We have got to keep more of our young people out of trouble, with prevention strategies not dictated by Washington but developed in communities. I challenge all of our communities, all of our adults, to give our children futures to say yes to. And I challenge Congress not to abandon the crime bill's support of these grassroots prevention efforts.\nFinally, to reduce crime and violence we have to reduce the drug problem. The challenge begins in our homes, with parents talking to their children openly and firmly. It embraces our churches and synagogues, our youth groups and our schools.\nI challenge Congress not to cut our support for drug-free schools. People like the D.A.R.E. officers are making a real impression on grade schoolchildren that will give them the strength to say no when the time comes.\nMeanwhile, we continue our efforts to cut the flow of drugs into America. For the last 2 years, one man in particular has been on the front lines of that effort. Tonight I am nominating him, a hero of the Persian Gulf War and the Commander in Chief of the United States Military Southern Command, General Barry McCaffrey, as America's new drug czar.\nGeneral McCaffrey has earned three Purple Hearts and two Silver Stars fighting for this country. Tonight I ask that he lead our Nation's battle against drugs at home and abroad. To succeed, he needs a force far larger than he has ever commanded before. He needs all of us. Every one of us has a role to play on this team.\nThank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your country one more time.\nOur fifth challenge: to leave our environment safe and clean for the next generation. Because of a generation of bipartisan effort we do have cleaner water and air, lead levels in children's blood has been cut by 70 percent, toxic emissions from factories cut in half. Lake Erie was dead, and now it's a thriving resource. But 10 million children under 12 still live within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. A third of us breathe air that endangers our health. And in too many communities the water is not safe to drink. We still have much to do.\nYet Congress has voted to cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent. That means more toxic chemicals in our water, more smog in our air, more pesticides in our food. Lobbyists for polluters have been allowed to write their own loopholes into bills to weaken laws that protect the health and safety of our children. Some say that the taxpayer should pick up the tab for toxic waste and let polluters who can afford to fix it off the hook. I challenge Congress to reexamine those policies and to reverse them.\nThis issue has not been a partisan issue. The most significant environmental gains in the last 30 years were made under a Democratic Congress and President Richard Nixon. We can work together. We have to believe some basic things. Do you believe we can expand the economy without hurting the environment? I do. Do you believe we can create more jobs over the long run by cleaning the environment up? I know we can. That should be our commitment.\nWe must challenge businesses and communities to take more initiative in protecting the environment, and we have to make it easier for them to do it. To businesses this administration is saying: If you can find a cheaper, more efficient way than Government regulations require to meet tough pollution standards, do it, as long as you do it right. To communities we say: We must strengthen community right-to-know laws requiring polluters to disclose their emissions, but you have to use the information to work with business to cut pollution. People do have a right to know that their air and their water are safe.\nOur sixth challenge is to maintain America's leadership in the fight for freedom and peace throughout the world. Because of American leadership, more people than ever before live free and at peace. And Americans have known 50 years of prosperity and security.\nWe owe thanks especially to our veterans of World War II. I would like to say to Senator Bob Dole and to all others in this Chamber who fought in World War II, and to all others on both sides of the aisle who have fought bravely in all our conflicts since: I salute your service and so do the American people.\nAll over the world, even after the cold war, people still look to us and trust us to help them seek the blessings of peace and freedom. But as the cold war fades into memory, voices of isolation say America should retreat from its responsibilities. I say they are wrong.\nThe threats we face today as Americans respect no Nation's borders. Think of them: terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, drug trafficking, ethnic and religious hatred, aggression by rogue states, environmental degradation. If we fail to address these threats today, we will suffer the consequences in all our tomorrows.\nOf course, we can't be everywhere. Of course, we can't do everything. But where our interests and our values are at stake, and where we can make a difference, America must lead. We must not be isolationist. We must not be the world's policeman. But we can and should be the world's very best peacemaker.\nBy keeping our military strong, by using diplomacy where we can and force where we must, by working with others to share the risk and the cost of our efforts, America is making a difference for people here and around the world. For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age—for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age—there is not a single Russian missile pointed at America's children.\nNorth Korea has now frozen its dangerous nuclear weapons program. In Haiti, the dictators are gone, democracy has a new day, the flow of desperate refugees to our shores has subsided. Through tougher trade deals for America, over 80 of them, we have opened markets abroad, and now exports are at an all-time high, growing faster than imports and creating good American jobs.\nWe stood with those taking risks for peace: in Northern Ireland, where Catholic and Protestant children now tell their parents, violence must never return; in the Middle East, where Arabs and Jews who once seemed destined to fight forever now share knowledge and resources and even dreams.\nAnd we stood up for peace in Bosnia. Remember the skeletal prisoners, the mass graves, the campaign to rape and torture, the endless lines of refugees, the threat of a spreading war. All these threats, all these horrors have now begun to give way to the promise of peace. Now our troops and a strong NATO, together with our new partners from central Europe and elsewhere, are helping that peace to take hold.\nAs all of you know, I was just there with a bipartisan congressional group, and I was so proud not only of what our troops were doing but of the pride they evidenced in what they were doing. They knew what America's mission in this world is, and they were proud to be carrying it out.\nThrough these efforts, we have enhanced the security of the American people, but make no mistake about it: Important challenges remain.\nThe START II treaty with Russia will cut our nuclear stockpiles by another 25 percent. I urge the Senate to ratify it now. We must end the race to create new nuclear weapons by signing a truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty this year.\nAs we remember what happened in the Japanese subway, we can outlaw poison gas forever if the Senate ratifies the Chemical Weapons Convention this year. We can intensify the fight against terrorists and organized criminals at home and abroad if Congress passes the antiterrorism legislation I proposed after the Oklahoma City bombing, now. We can help more people move from hatred to hope all across the world in our own interest if Congress gives us the means to remain the world's leader for peace.\nMy fellow Americans, the six challenges I have just discussed are for all of us. Our seventh challenge is really America's challenge to those of us in this hallowed Hall tonight: to reinvent our Government and make our democracy work for them.\nLast year this Congress applied to itself the laws it applies to everyone else. This Congress banned gifts and meals from lobbyists. This Congress forced lobbyists to disclose who pays them and what legislation they are trying to pass or kill. This Congress did that, and I applaud you for it.\nNow I challenge Congress to go further, to curb special interest influence in politics by passing the first truly bipartisan campaign finance reform bill in a generation. You, Republicans and Democrats alike, can show the American people that we can limit spending and we can open the airwaves to all candidates.\nI also appeal to Congress to pass the line-item veto you promised the American people.\nOur administration is working hard to give the American people a Government that works better and costs less. Thanks to the work of Vice President Gore, we are eliminating 16,000 pages of unnecessary rules and regulations, shifting more decisionmaking out of Washington, back to States and local communities.\nAs we move into the era of balanced budgets and smaller Government, we must work in new ways to enable people to make the most of their own lives. We are helping America's communities, not with more bureaucracy but with more opportunities. Through our successful empowerment zones and community development banks, we're helping people to find jobs, to start businesses. And with tax incentives for companies that clean up abandoned industrial property, we can bring jobs back to places that desperately, desperately need them.\nBut there are some areas that the Federal Government should not leave and should address and address strongly. One of these areas is the problem of illegal immigration. After years of neglect, this administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders. We are increasing border controls by 50 percent. We are increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants. And tonight, I announce I will sign an Executive order to deny Federal contracts to businesses that hire illegal immigrants.\nLet me be very clear about this: We are still a nation of immigrants; we should be proud of it. We should honor every legal immigrant here, working hard to be a good citizen, working hard to become a new citizen. But we are also a nation of laws.\nI want to say a special word now to those who work for our Federal Government. Today the Federal work force is 200,000 employees smaller than it was the day I took office as President. Our Federal Government today is the smallest it has been in 30 years, and it's getting smaller every day. Most of our fellow Americans probably don't know that. And there's a good reason—a good reason: The remaining Federal work force is composed of hard-working Americans who are now working harder and working smarter than ever before to make sure the quality of our services does not decline.\nI'd like to give you one example. His name is Richard Dean. He's a 49-year-old Vietnam veteran who's worked for the Social Security Administration for 22 years now. Last year he was hard at work in the Federal Building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 169 people and brought the rubble down all around him. He reentered that building four times. He saved the lives of three women. He's here with us this evening, and I want to recognize Richard and applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal heroism. But Richard Dean's story doesn't end there. This last November, he was forced out of his office when the Government shut down. And the second time the Government shut down he continued helping Social Security recipients, but he was working without pay.\nOn behalf of Richard Dean and his family, and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the American people, I challenge all of you in this Chamber: Let's never, ever shut the Federal Government down again.\nOn behalf of all Americans, especially those who need their Social Security payments at the beginning of March, I also challenge the Congress to preserve the full faith and credit of the United States, to honor the obligations of this great Nation as we have for 220 years, to rise above partisanship and pass a straightforward extension of the debt limit and show people America keeps its word.\nI know that this evening I have asked a lot of Congress and even more from America. But I am confident: When Americans work together in their homes, their schools, their churches, their synagogues, their civic groups, their workplace, they can meet any challenge.\nI say again, the era of big Government is over. But we can't go back to the era of fending for yourself. We have to go forward to the era of working together as a community, as a team, as one America, with all of us reaching across these lines that divide us— the division, the discrimination, the rancor—we have to reach across it to find common ground. We have got to work together if we want America to work.\nI want you to meet two more people tonight who do just that. Lucius Wright is a teacher in the Jackson, Mississippi, public school system. A Vietnam veteran, he has created groups to help inner-city children turn away from gangs and build futures they can believe in. Sergeant Jennifer Rodgers is a police officer in Oklahoma City. Like Richard Dean, she helped to pull her fellow citizens out of the rubble and deal with that awful tragedy. She reminds us that in their response to that atrocity the people of Oklahoma City lifted all of us with their basic sense of decency and community.\nLucius Wright and Jennifer Rodgers are special Americans. And I have the honor to announce tonight that they are the very first of several thousand Americans who will be chosen to carry the Olympic torch on its long journey from Los Angeles to the centennial of the modern Olympics in Atlanta this summer, not because they are star athletes but because they are star citizens, community heroes meeting America's challenges. They are our real champions.\nPlease stand up.\nNow each of us must hold high the torch of citizenship in our own lives. None of us can finish the race alone. We can only achieve our destiny together, one hand, one generation, one American connecting to another.\nThere have always been things we could do together, dreams we could make real which we could never have done on our own. We Americans have forged our identity, our very Union, from the very point of view that we can accommodate every point on the planet, every different opinion. But we must be bound together by a faith more powerful than any doctrine that divides us, by our belief in progress, our love of liberty, and our relentless search for common ground.\nAmerica has always sought and always risen to every challenge. Who would say that having come so far together, we will not go forward from here? Who would say that this age of possibility is not for all Americans?\nOur country is and always has been a great and good nation. But the best is yet to come if we all do our parts.\nThank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\n","Somebody's Heine' is crowdin' my icebox.\nSomebody's cold one is givin' me chills.\nGuess I'll just close my eyes.\n\nFlip on the tele, wrestle with Jimmy.\nSomething is bubbling behind my back.\nThe bottle is ready to blow.\n\nSay it ain't so.\nYour drug is a heartbreaker\nSay it ain't so.\nMy love is a life taker.\n\nI can't confront you, I never could do.\nThat which might hurt you, so try and be cool.\nWhen I say this way is a waterslide away from me.\nThat takes you further every day, so be cool.\n\nDear Daddy, I write you in spite of years of silence.\nYou've cleaned up, found Jesus, things are good or so I hear.\nThis bottle of Steven's awakens ancient feelings.\nLike father, stepfather, the son is drowning in the flood.\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n","Tonight, I come not to speak about the \"State of the Government\", not to detail every new initiative we plan for the coming year, nor describe every line in the budget. I'm here to speak to you and to the American people about the State of the Union about our world, the changes we've seen, the challenges we face. And what that means for America.\nThere are singular moments in history, dates that divide all that goes before from all that comes after. And many of us in this chamber have lived much of our lives in a world whose fundamental features were defined in 1945. And the events of that year decreed the shape of nations, the pace of progress, freedom or oppression for millions of people around the world.\nNineteen Forty-Five provided the common frame of reference the compass points of the postwar era we've relied upon to understand ourselves. And that was our world until now. The events of the year just ended, the Revolution of '89, have been a chain reaction, changes so striking that it marks the beginning of a new era in the world's affairs.\nThink back think back just twelve short months ago to the world we knew as 1989 began.\nOne year, one year ago the people of Panama lived in fear under the thumb of a dictator. Today democracy is restored. Panama is free.\n\"Operation Just Cause\" has achieved its objective. And the number of military personell in Panama is now very close to what it was before the operation began. And tonight I am announcing that before the end of February the additional numbers of American troops, the brave men and women of our armed forces who made this mission a success, will be back home.\nA year ago in Poland, Lech Walesa declared he was ready to open a dialogue with the Communist rulers of that country. And today, with the future of a free Poland in their own hands, members of Solidarity lead the Polish government.\nAnd a year ago, freedom's playwright, Vaclav Havel, languished as a prisoner in Prague. And today it's Vaclav Havel, President of Czechoslovakia.\nAnd one year ago Erich Honecker of East Germany claimed history as his guide. He predicted the Berlin Wall would last another hundred years. And today, less than one year later, it's the wall that's history.\nRemarkable events, remarkable events, events that fulfill the long-held hopes of the American people. Events that validate the longstanding goals of American policy, a policy based upon a single shining principle: the cause of freedom.\nAmerica, not just the nation, but an idea alive in the minds of the people, everywhere. As this new world takes shape, America stands at the center of a widening circle of freedom, today, tomorrow and into the next century.\nOur nation is the enduring dream of every immigrant who ever set foot on these shores, and the millions still struggling to be free. This nation, this idea callled America was and always will be a new world, our new world.\nAt a workers' rally in a place called Branik on the outskirts of Prague the idea called America is alive. A worker, dressed in grimy overalls, rises to speak at the factory gates. And he begins his speech to his fellow citizens with these words, words of a distant revolution: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"\nIt's no secret here at home freedom's door opened long ago. The cornerstones of this free society have already been set in place: democracy, competition, opportunity, private investment, stewardship, and of course, leadership.\nAnd our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours, a system second to none, and make it better:\nA better America where there's a job for whoever wants one;\nWhere women working outside the home can be confident their childeren are in safe and loving care, and where Government works to expand child alternatives for parents. Where we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong economy. Where \"Made in the USA\" is recognized around the world as the symbol of quality and progress, And where every one of us enjoys the same opportunities to live, to work and to contribute to society. And where, for the first time, the American mainstream includes all of our disabled citizens. Where everyone has a roof over his head, and where the homeless get the help they need to live in dignity. Where our schools challenge and support our kids and our teachers, and every one of them makes the grade, Where every street, every city, every school and every child is drug-free. And finally, and finally, where no American is forgotten. Our hearts go out to our hostages, our hostages who are ceaselessly in our minds and in our efforts.\nThat's part of the future we want to see, the future we can make for ourselves. But dreams alone won't get us there. We need to extend our horizon, to commit to the long view. And our mission for the future starts today.\nIn the tough competitive markets around the world, America faces the great challenges and great opportunities. And we know that we can succeed in the global economic arena of the 90's. But to meet that challenge we must make some fundamental changes, some crucial investments in ourselves.\nYes, we are going to invest in America. This Administration is determined to encourage the creation of capital, capital of all kinds. Physical capital: everything from our farms and factories to our workshops and production lines, all that is needed to produce and deliver quality goods and quality services. Intellectual, intellectual capital: the source of ideas that spark tomorrow's products. And of course human capital: the talented work force that we'll need to compete in the global market.\nAnd let me tell you, if we ignore human capital, if we lose the spirit of American ingenuity, the sprit that is the hallmark of the AMERICAN worker, that would be bad. The American worker is the most productive worker in the world.\nWe need to save more. We need to expand the pool of capital for new investments that mean more jobs and more growth. And that's the idea behind the new initiative I call the Family Savings Plan, which I will send to Congress tomorrow.\nWe need to cut the tax on capital gains, encourage, encourage risk-takers, especially those in small businesses, to take those steps that translate into economic reward, jobs, and a better life for all of us.\nWe'll do what it takes to invest in America's future. The budget commitment is there. The money is there. It's there for research and development, R and D, a record high. It's there for our housing initiative, hope, H-O-P-E, to help everyone from first-time homebuyers to the homeless. The money's there to keep our kids drug-free, 70 percent more than when I took office in 1989. It's there for space exploration, and its there for education, another record high.\nAnd one more, and one more thing. Last fall at the education summit, the governors and I agreed to look for ways to help make sure that our kids are ready to learn the very first day they walk into the classroom. And I've made good on that commitment by proposing a record increase in funds, an extra half billion dollars, for something near and dear to all of us: Head Start.\nEducation is the one investment that means more for our future, because it means the most for our children. Real improvement in our schools is not simply a matter of spending more. It's a matter of asking more, expecting more, of our schools, our teachers, of our kids, of our parents and of ourselves. And that's why tonight, and that's why tonight, I am announcing America's education goals, goals developed with enormous cooperation from the nation's governors. And if I might I'd like to say I'm very pleased that Governor Gardner and Governor Clinton, Governor Branstad, Governor Campbell, all of whom were very key in these discussion, these deliberations, are with us here tonight.\nBy the, by the year 2000, every child must start school ready to learn. The United States must increase the high school graduation rate to no less than 90 percent. And we are going to make sure our schools' diplomas mean something. In critical subjects, at the fourth, eighth, and 12th grades, we must assess our students' performance.\nBy the, by the year 2000 U.S. students must be the first in the world in math and science achievement. Every American adult must be a skilled, literate worker and citizen. Every school must offer the kind of disciplined envorionment that makes it possible for our kids to learn. And every school in America must be drug-free.\nAmbitious aims? Of course. Easy to do? Far from it. But the future's at stake. The nation will not accept anything less than excellence in education.\nThese investments will help keep America competitive. And I know this about the American people: we welcome competition. We'll match our ingenuity, our energy, our experience, and technology our spirit and enterprise against anyone. But let the competition be free, but let it also be fair. America is ready.\nSince we really mean it, and since we're serious about being ready to meet our challenge, we're getting our own house in order. We have made real progress. Seven years ago, the Federal deficit was 6 percent of our gross national product, 6 percent. In the new budget I sent up two days ago the deficit is down to 1 percent of GNP.\nThat budget brings Federal spending under control. It meets the Gramm-Rudman target. It brings the deficit down further. And balances the budget by 1993, with no new taxes.\nAnd let me tell you, there's still more than enough Federal spending. For most of us, $1.2 trillion is still a lot of money.\nAnd once the budget is balanced, we can operate the way every family must when it has bills to pay. We won't leave it to our children and grandchildren. Once it's balanced, we will start paying off the national debt.\nAnd there's something more, and there's something more we owe the generations of the future: stewardship, the safekeeping of America's precious environmental inheritance.\nAs just one sign of how serious we are, we will elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet rank. Not, not more bureaucracy, not more red tape, but the certainty that here at home, and especially in our dealings with other nations, environmental issues have the status they deserve.\nThis year's budget provides over $2 billion in new spending to protect our environment, with over $1 billion for global change research, and a new intiative I call America the Beautiful to expand our national parks and wildlife preserves and improve recreational facilities on public lands.\nAnd something else, something that will help keep this country clean, from our forest land to the inner cities, and keep America beautiful for generations to come, the money to plant a billion trees a year.\nAnd tonight, and tonight let me say again to all the members of the Congress, the American people did not send us here to bicker. There is work to do, and they sent us here to get it done. And once again, in the spirit of cooperation I offer my hand to all of you. And let's work together to do the will of the people---clean air, child care, the educational excellence act, crime and drugs. It's time to act. The farm bill, transportation policy, product liability reform, enterprise zones. It's time to act together.\nAnd there's one thing I hope we can agree on. It's about our commitments. And I'm talking about Social Security.\nTo every American out there on Social Security, to every, every American supporting that system today, and to everyone counting on it when they retire, we made a promise to you, and we are going to keep it.\nWe, we rescued the system in 1983 and it's sound again, bipartisan arrangement. Our budget fully funds today's benefits and it asssures that future benefits will be funded as well. And the last thing we need to do is mess around with Social Security.\nThere's one more problem we need to address. We must give careful consideration to the recommendations of the health care studies under way now. And that's why tonight, I am asking Dr. Sullivan, Lou Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, to lead a Domestic Policy Council review of recommendations on the quality, accessibility and cost of our nation's health care system. I am committed to bring the staggering costs of health care under control.\nThe State of the Government does indeed depend on many of us in this very chamber. But the State of the Union depends on all Americans. We must maintain the democratic decency that makes a nation out of millions of individuals. And I've been appalled at the recent mail bombings across this country. Every one of us must confront and condemn racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry and hate. Not next week, not tomorrow, but right now. Every single one of us.\nThe State of the Union depends on whether we help our neighbor, claim the problems of our community as our own. We've got to step forward when there's trouble, lend a hand, be what I call a point of light to a stranger in need. We've got to take the time after a busy day to sit down and read with our kids, help them with their homework, pass along the values we had as children. And that's how we sustain the State of the Union.\nEvery effort is important. It all adds up. It's doing the things that give democracy meaning. It all adds up to who we are and who we will be.\nAnd let me say, that so long as we remember the American idea, so long as we live up to the American ideal, the State of the Union will remain sound and strong.\nAnd to those who worry that we've lost our way, well, I want you to listen to parts of a letter written by James Markwell, Pvt. 1st Class James Markwell, a 20-year-old Army medic to the First Battalion, 75th Rangers. It's dated Dec. 18, the day before our armed forces went into action in Panama. It's a letter servicemen write—and hope will never, ever be sent. And sadly, Private Markwell's mother did receive this letter. She passed it on to me out there in Cincinnati. And here is some of what he wrote: \"I've never been afraid of death, but I know he is waiting at the corner...I've been trained to kill and to save, and so has everyone else. I am frightened of what lays beyond the fog, and yet... do not mourn for me. Revel in the life that I have died to give you... But most of all, don't forget that the Army was my choice. Something that I wanted to do. Remember I joined the Army to serve my country and inure that you are free to do what you want and to live your lives freely.\"\nLet me add that Private Markwell was among the first to see battle in Panama, and among the first to fall. But he knew what he believed in. He carried the idea we call America in his heart.\nI began tonight speaking about the changes we've seen this past year. There is a new world of challenges and opportunities before us. And there is a need for leadership that only America can provide.\nNearly 40 years ago, in his last address to the Congress, President Harry Truman predicted such a time would come. He said, \"As our world grows stronger, more united, more attractive to men on both sides of the Iron Curtain, then inevitably there will come a time of change within the Communist world.\"\nToday, that change is taking place.\nFor more than 40 years, America and its allies held Communism in check and insured that democracy would continue to exist. And today, with Communism crumbling, our aim must be to insure democracy's advance, to take the lead in forging peace and freedom's best hope, a great and growing commonwealth of free nations.\nAnd to the Congres and to all Americans, I say it is time to acclaim a new consensus at home and abroad, a common vision of the peaceful world we want to see.\nHere in our own hemisphere it is time for all the people of the Americas, North and South, to live in freedom.\nIn the Far East and Africa, it's time for the full flowering of free governments and free markets that have served the engine of progress.\nIt is time to offer our hand to the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe so that continent, for too long a continent divided, can see a future whole and free.\nIt's time to build on our new relationship with the Soviet Union, to endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward democracy and economic opportunity.\nWe are in a period of great transition, great hope, and yet great uncertainty. We recognize that the Soviet military threat in Europe is diminishing, but we see little change in Soviet strategic modernization. And, therefore, we must sustain our own strategic offense modernization and the Strategic Defense Initiative.\nBut the time is right to move forward on a conventional arms control agreement to move us to more appropriate levels of military forces in Europe, a coherent defense program that insures the U.S. will continue to be a catalyst for peaceful change in Europe. And I've consulted with leaders of NATO. In fact I spoke by phone with President Gorbachev just today.\nAnd I agree with our European allies that an American military presence in Europe is essential and that it should not be solely tied to the Soviet military presence in Eastern Europe.\nBut our troop levels can still be lower. And so tonight I am announcing a major new step for a further reduction in U.S. and Soviet manpower in Central and Eastern Europe to 195,000 on each side.\nThis number, this number, this level, reflects the advice of our senior military advisers. It's designed to protect American and European interests and sustain NATO's defense strategy. A swift conclusion to our arms control talks—conventional, chemical and strategic--- must now be our goal. And that time has come.\nStill, we must recognize an unfortunate fact: in many regions of the world tonight the reality is conflict, not peace. Enduring animosities and opposing interests remain. And thus the cause of peace must be served by an America strong enough and sure enough to defend our interests and our ideals. It's this American idea that for the past four decades helped inspire the Revolution of '89.\nAnd here at home, and in the world, there is history in the making, and history to be made. Six months ago, early in this season of change, I stood at the gates of the Gdansk shipyard in Poland at the monument to the fallen workers of Solidarity. It's a monument of simple majesty. Three tall crosses rise up from the stones, and atop each cross, an anchor, an ancient symbol of hope.\nThe anchor in our world today is freedom. Holding us steady in times of change, a symbol of hope to all the world. And freedom is at the very heart of the idea that is America. Giving life to the idea depends on every one of us. Our anchor has always been faith and family.\nIn the last few days of this past monumentous year, our family was blessed once more, celebrating the joy of life when a little boy became our 12th grandchild. When I held the little guy fo the first time, the troubles at home and abroad seemed manageable, and totally in perspective.\nAnd now I know, I know you're probably thinking, Well, that's just a grandfather talking.\nWell, maybe you're right. But I've met a lot of children this past year across this country, as all of you have. Everywhere from the Far East to Eastern Europe. All kids are unique. Yet, all kids are alike. The budding young environmentalist I met this month, who joined me in exploring the Florida Everglades. The Little Leaguers I played catch with in Poland, ready to go from Warsaw to the World Series. And even the kids who are ill or alone— and God bless those boarder babies, born addicted to drugs and AIDS — coping with problems no child should have to face. But, you know, when it comes to hope and the future, every kid is the same: full of dreams, ready to take on the world, all special because they are the very future of freedom. And to them belongs this new world I've been speaking about.\nAnd so tonight, I'm going to ask something of every one of you. Now let me start with my generation, with the grandparents out there. You are our living link with the past. Tell your grandchildren the story of struggles waged at home and abroad, of sacrifices freely made for freedom's sake. And tell them your own story as well, because every American has a story to tell.\nAnd parents, your children look to you for direction and guidance. Tell them of faith and family. Tell them we are one nation under God. Teach them that of all the many gifts they can receive, liberty is their most precious legacy. And of all the gifts they can give, the greatest, the greatest is helping others.\nAnd to the children and young people out there tonight, with you rests our hope, all that America will mean in the years and decades ahead. Fix your vision on a new century, your century, on dreams we cannot see, on the destiny that is yours and yours alone.\nAnd finally, let all Americans, all of us here in this chamber, the symbolic center of democracy, affirm our allegience to this idea we call America. And let us remember that the State of the Union depends upon each and every one of us.\nGod bless all of you. And may God bless this great nation, the United States of America\n","\nWell, I have received much encouragement to relate my experiences on Ecstasy, so here is an attempt...\n\nI was told almost a week in advance that I might have the opportunity to try Ecstasy with the young lady who acted as a guide for my first LSD trip. We were to meet at a given tube station not far from the nightclub where the experimentation would take place.\n\nI was not easy about trying a new psychedelic in a crowded place, realizing this could have been difficult to handle with LSD. But there lay the opportunity and I just hoped to have enough mental control (practice of Yoga helping) if things got tight.\n\nI had read about MDMA in Peter Stafford's Psychedelics Encyclopaedia, but was aware E's are not very often pure MDMA. In addition, the book had stayed at home and my memory of its contents had faded somewhat. So I scanned the net for an Ecstasy FAQ and read that, also reading whatever current reports of the experience were posted on alt.drugs.\n\nQuite strangely, that was also the week my father decided to give me a hysterical account of some absurd and manipulatively badly written article in a Swiss newspaper depicting the dreadful and possessive evils of the Love Pill. He knows I have profound interest in altered consciousness and its chemical gateways, but not what I'm up to in my spare time...\n\nAnyway, I psyched myself up all week for the event, and when the Saturday evening came, I left a little note on my desk explaining that if I was unlucky that night, the Quest had been worth it.\n\nAs soon as we entered the nightclub, we went upstairs to the dance floor. An immense room with drapes hanging off all walls, a screen with a permanent slide of Planet Earth on it and countless balloons floating all around.\n\nSitting in a corner of the stage, I was handed my 2/3 of a White Dove pill. I insisted on chewing it to taste it - I wanted some intimate contact with the substance I was about to share my mind with. Tasted awful. Very chemical. That made me laugh, especially looking at the face of my companion who had agreed to bite into it too. We washed the taste down with gulps from the traditional raver's water bottle, as our supplier explained to us a few of the basics and possible initial effects.\n\n'If you feel funny, get up and dance.' she had said.\n\nSure enough, about 25 minutes later, I was feeling slightly uncomfortable. Stomach ? Mind ? I wasn't sure. From feeling quite talkative I went to being rather silent and reserved. So I got up and began to jiggle about. That felt a whole lot better.\n\nI was soon joined by the other Ecstasy-newbie who commented that nothing was happening to her.\n\n'I feel weird', I said.\n\n'Keep dancing' our supplier repeated, she too waiting for her E to kick in.\n\nMinutes later I experienced a rush to the head - I felt for a few seconds that I was really going to lose it, and had a vision of myself huddled in a corner, crying for hours. Damn, just my luck I thought, a bad trip on the first one. I literally felt as if my mind was going to black out. No way, I thought, no way. My dad talks WOsD propaganda and I'm not having a bad trip. I quickly searched for my companions on the stage and got closer to them. I danced more energetically, trying to get into the music.\n\nSeconds later a most unbelievable surge of energy and gentle warmth rushed through my body. It was so brutally intense, all I could do for several minutes was inhale and let the breath come out as one long howl of indescriptible joy. Many around me joined in. It seemed as though half the stage was just hollering in joint ecstasy.\n\nEcstasy. The perfect word. No other could have described what I was experiencing right then and there. Beyond words. The entire message was contained in a scream and the most intense smile my face had displayed in ages.\n\nOur supplier bounded up to us asking 'are you OK ? Have you eased up both of you ? You were rather tense'. I just grinned my face off.\n\n'I feel like hugging everybody' I shouted.\n\n'Then DO !' she yelled, flinging herself around my neck. Geez, that felt so GOOD ! Hugging was the most rewarding, comforting and uplifting experience ! This, for a person such as myself, usually quite conscious of personal space and physical contact with strangers, was a truly fascinating discovery.\n\nThe music too was surrounding me in trance-like comfort. The sound spoke to every nerve in my body. This is the synergy between dance, mind and rythmic signatures Terrence McKenna was on about, I thought. Wow. I could enjoy the 'Here and Now' - any time a thought of something unpleasant from the world would arise, I could look at it without stress, then gently push it out of my mind. It didn't matter that I had a project and exams. This state was pure, free, uninhibited.\n\nSpeaking to people in the chill-out room was bliss. I wanted everybody to be OK, I wanted to know their names, how many times they came here, what they were on... They were all so friendly.\n\nOne of them asked me 'You're all loved up, right ?'. I answered with the ecstatic grin. 'It's their first E' he was told. He then got up, opened his arms wide, and gave me a big hug. There was something so pure and brotherly about the whole atmosphere, it was overwhelming.\n\nI noticed all the described effects : brighter lights and colours, increased physical energy yet great calm, strong empathy and forgiveness for agressive behaviour, merging with the music to a trance state...\n\n'Beware of inappropriate emotional bonding', I had read. Damn, that's what held me back from interacting more fully with an unusually pretty girl who seemed to want to dance with me. As I noticed she was looking into my eyes and half turning to face me, I felt my heartbeat pound away. Another amazing wave of warmth shot up through my stomach to the top of my head. I felt my entire body vibrating with pleasure. I was on E and I was being turned on.\n\nI just looked into her eyes. I was confused by the intensity of the attraction, and uncertain how much of this was real. I needed a nod from a friend to go ahead, or something like that.\n\nThe nod never came. But I learned something really valuable there. Several years ago I got screwed up by a strong bondage with a girl. She moved away, and sure enough some predator attracted by her beauty seduced her. Though she chucked him away fast, that was the end for us. I had never been able to start another relationship with a girl since. I would miss any cue girls would send out to me, or even turn away from them, frightened. That Saturday night, Ecstasy cleared me from this emotional hangup. On the way down, I became introspective and meditative, and figured out what had been inhibiting me from falling in love again. This made me feel a great weight had just left my conscience, and I shared this feeling with friends immediately. I was once more free to love.\n\nSounds dramatic, I know. But this realization was deep, complete and liberating. LSD had freed my mind from some of its shackles, Ecstasy was freeing my feelings.\n\nThere would be so much more to say. But if you've read this far, I won't abuse your patience.\n\nWhat remains from the first experience is this emotional freedom, this feeling for Compassion (I now have a much better notion of what Buddha or Christ seemed to be preaching), and an increased ability to tune in to the structures and messages of music. On a more subtle level, I find it easier to initiate conversation with people and can cope better with aimless talk about this or that. I can also pick out almost anybody in a nightclub who is on E ! A real sharing and compassionate bunch - if a complete stranger happily offers you water, a spliff or a Vicks inhaler, I give you one guess as to what he's swallowed. Check the intense smile on his face, too.\n\nI have had only two more experiences with Ecstasy since.\n\nOn one occasion I met a really interesting group on the dance floor, winding up back at their place smoking spliff and playing video games, with a good bed for the night ! It also confirmed the return of my ability to interact with girls without hangups.\n\nOn the second occasion, I had twenty minutes of deeply mystical feeling ('I feel I'm talking to Jesus' I told my friend - this being from an agnostic). I also had a blinding moment in which I felt intensely how deeply important my friends are to me and how far beyond ordinary bonds our friendship goes.\n\nSo for whoever is going to try Ecstasy : aside from the usual drink-lots-of-water-and-wear-loose-clothing advice, prepare for times of howling beauty and buzzing interactions. Remember you can look at personal problems in a warm detached manner and maybe solve emotional history problems. And prepare for the ultimate experiences in dancing. \n\n","I never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. He seemed\nto live only for joking. To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to\ntell it well, was the surest road to his favor. Thus it happened that\nhis seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers.\nThey all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men,\nas well as inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or\nwhether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I\nhave never been quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean\njoker is a rara avis in terris.\n\nAbout the refinements, or, as he called them, the ‘ghost’ of wit, the\nking troubled himself very little. He had an especial admiration for\nbreadth in a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake\nof it. Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais’\n‘Gargantua’ to the ‘Zadig’ of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical\njokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones.\n\nAt the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone\nout of fashion at court. Several of the great continental ‘powers’ still\nretain their ‘fools,’ who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were\nexpected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment’s notice,\nin consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.\n\nOur king, as a matter of course, retained his ‘fool.’ The fact is, he\nrequired something in the way of folly--if only to counterbalance\nthe heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers--not to\nmention himself.\n\nHis fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His\nvalue was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also\na dwarf and a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days,\nas fools; and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through\ntheir days (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both\na jester to laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. But, as I have already\nobserved, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat,\nround, and unwieldy--so that it was no small source of self-gratulation\nwith our king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool’s name), he possessed\na triplicate treasure in one person.\n\nI believe the name ‘Hop-Frog’ was not that given to the dwarf by his\nsponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent\nof the several ministers, on account of his inability to walk as\nother men do. In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of\ninterjectional gait--something between a leap and a wriggle--a movement\nthat afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to\nthe king, for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a\nconstitutional swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was\naccounted a capital figure.\n\nBut although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could\nmove only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the\nprodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his\narms, by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled\nhim to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes\nwere in question, or any thing else to climb. At such exercises he\ncertainly much more resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a\nfrog.\n\nI am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog\noriginally came. It was from some barbarous region, however, that\nno person ever heard of--a vast distance from the court of our king.\nHop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself\n(although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been\nforcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces,\nand sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious\ngenerals.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close\nintimacy arose between the two little captives. Indeed, they soon became\nsworn friends. Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport,\nwas by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta\nmany services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty\n(although a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed\nmuch influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the\nbenefit of Hop-Frog.\n\nOn some grand state occasion--I forgot what--the king determined to\nhave a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind,\noccurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta\nwere sure to be called into play. Hop-Frog, in especial, was so\ninventive in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel\ncharacters, and arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could\nbe done, it seems, without his assistance.\n\nThe night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been\nfitted up, under Trippetta’s eye, with every kind of device which could\npossibly give eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of\nexpectation. As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed\nthat everybody had come to a decision on such points. Many had made\nup their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a\nmonth, in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision\nanywhere--except in the case of the king and his seven minsters. Why\nthey hesitated I never could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke.\nMore probably, they found it difficult, on account of being so fat, to\nmake up their minds. At all events, time flew; and, as a last resort\nthey sent for Trippetta and Hop-Frog.\n\nWhen the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found\nhim sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council;\nbut the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. He knew that\nHop-Frog was not fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to\nmadness; and madness is no comfortable feeling. But the king loved his\npractical jokes, and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as\nthe king called it) ‘to be merry.’\n\n“Come here, Hop-Frog,” said he, as the jester and his friend entered the\nroom; “swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here\nHop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention.\nWe want characters--characters, man--something novel--out of the way. We\nare wearied with this everlasting sameness. Come, drink! the wine will\nbrighten your wits.”\n\nHop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these\nadvances from the king; but the effort was too much. It happened to\nbe the poor dwarf’s birthday, and the command to drink to his ‘absent\nfriends’ forced the tears to his eyes. Many large, bitter drops fell\ninto the goblet as he took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant.\n\n“Ah! ha! ha!” roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly drained the\nbeaker.--“See what a glass of good wine can do! Why, your eyes are\nshining already!”\n\nPoor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect\nof wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous.\nHe placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the\ncompany with a half--insane stare. They all seemed highly amused at the\nsuccess of the king’s ‘joke.’\n\n“And now to business,” said the prime minister, a very fat man.\n\n“Yes,” said the King; “Come lend us your assistance. Characters, my fine\nfellow; we stand in need of characters--all of us--ha! ha! ha!” and\nas this was seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the\nseven.\n\nHop-Frog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly.\n\n“Come, come,” said the king, impatiently, “have you nothing to suggest?”\n\n“I am endeavoring to think of something novel,” replied the dwarf,\nabstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine.\n\n“Endeavoring!” cried the tyrant, fiercely; “what do you mean by that?\nAh, I perceive. You are Sulky, and want more wine. Here, drink this!”\n and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple, who\nmerely gazed at it, gasping for breath.\n\n“Drink, I say!” shouted the monster, “or by the fiends-”\n\nThe dwarf hesitated. The king grew purple with rage. The courtiers\nsmirked. Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch’s seat,\nand, falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.\n\nThe tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at\nher audacity. He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say--how most\nbecomingly to express his indignation. At last, without uttering a\nsyllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of\nthe brimming goblet in her face.\n\nThe poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh,\nresumed her position at the foot of the table.\n\nThere was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the\nfalling of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard. It was\ninterrupted by a low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which\nseemed to come at once from every corner of the room.\n\n“What--what--what are you making that noise for?” demanded the king,\nturning furiously to the dwarf.\n\nThe latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his\nintoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant’s face,\nmerely ejaculated:\n\n“I--I? How could it have been me?”\n\n“The sound appeared to come from without,” observed one of the\ncourtiers. “I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill\nupon his cage-wires.”\n\n“True,” replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion;\n“but, on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the\ngritting of this vagabond’s teeth.”\n\nHereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object\nto any one’s laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very\nrepulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow\nas much wine as desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained\nanother bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at\nonce, and with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade.\n\n“I cannot tell what was the association of idea,” observed he, very\ntranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, “but just\nafter your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her\nface--just after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was\nmaking that odd noise outside the window, there came into my mind a\ncapital diversion--one of my own country frolics--often enacted\namong us, at our masquerades: but here it will be new altogether.\nUnfortunately, however, it requires a company of eight persons and-”\n\n“Here we are!” cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the\ncoincidence; “eight to a fraction--I and my seven ministers. Come! what\nis the diversion?”\n\n“We call it,” replied the cripple, “the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs,\nand it really is excellent sport if well enacted.”\n\n“We will enact it,” remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering\nhis eyelids.\n\n“The beauty of the game,” continued Hop-Frog, “lies in the fright it\noccasions among the women.”\n\n“Capital!” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry.\n\n“I will equip you as ourang-outangs,” proceeded the dwarf; “leave all\nthat to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of\nmasqueraders will take you for real beasts--and of course, they will be\nas much terrified as astonished.”\n\n“Oh, this is exquisite!” exclaimed the king. “Hop-Frog! I will make a\nman of you.”\n\n“The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their\njangling. You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers.\nYour majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by\neight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the\ncompany; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately\nand gorgeously habited men and women. The contrast is inimitable!”\n\n“It must be,” said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was\ngrowing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog.\n\nHis mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but\neffective enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the\nepoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized\nworld; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently\nbeast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to\nnature was thus thought to be secured.\n\nThe king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet\nshirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage\nof the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the\nsuggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the\neight, by ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the\nourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by flu. A thick\ncoating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar.\nA long chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of\nthe king, and tied, then about another of the party, and also tied;\nthen about all successively, in the same manner. When this chaining\narrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each\nother as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear\nnatural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters,\nat right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the\npresent day, by those who capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in\nBorneo.\n\nThe grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a\ncircular room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only\nthrough a single window at top. At night (the season for which the\napartment was especially designed) it was illuminated principally by a\nlarge chandelier, depending by a chain from the centre of the sky-light,\nand lowered, or elevated, by means of a counter-balance as usual; but\n(in order not to look unsightly) this latter passed outside the cupola\nand over the roof.\n\nThe arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta’s\nsuperintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided\nby the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was\nthat, on this occasion, the chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings\n(which, in weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would\nhave been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who,\non account of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected\nto keep from out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier.\nAdditional sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the\nwar, and a flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand\nof each of the Caryaides [Caryatides] that stood against the wall--some\nfifty or sixty altogether.\n\nThe eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog’s advice, waited patiently\nuntil midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders)\nbefore making their appearance. No sooner had the clock ceased striking,\nhowever, than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together--for the\nimpediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to\nstumble as they entered.\n\nThe excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the\nheart of the king with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not\na few of the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be\nbeasts of some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many\nof the women swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the\nprecaution to exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon\nhave expiated their frolic in their blood. As it was, a general rush\nwas made for the doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked\nimmediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf’s suggestion, the keys\nhad been deposited with him.\n\nWhile the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only\nto his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the\npressure of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier\nordinarily hung, and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have\nbeen seen very gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came\nwithin three feet of the floor.\n\nSoon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the\nhall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and,\nof course, in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus\nsituated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels,\ninciting them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain\nat the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle\ndiametrically and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought,\nhe inserted the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend;\nand, in an instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was\ndrawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an\ninevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close\nconnection, and face to face.\n\nThe masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure,\nfrom their alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a\nwell-contrived pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the\npredicament of the apes.\n\n“Leave them to me!” now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making\nitself easily heard through all the din. “Leave them to me. I fancy I\nknow them. If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who\nthey are.”\n\nHere, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the\nwall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned,\nas he went, to the centre of the room-leaping, with the agility of a\nmonkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the\nchain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs,\nand still screaming: “I shall soon find out who they are!”\n\nAnd now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed\nwith laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the\nchain flew violently up for about thirty feet--dragging with it the\ndismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in\nmid-air between the sky-light and the floor. Hop-Frog, clinging to the\nchain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to\nthe eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued\nto thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover\nwho they were.\n\nSo thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a\ndead silence, of about a minute’s duration, ensued. It was broken by\njust such a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the\nattention of the king and his councillors when the former threw the wine\nin the face of Trippetta. But, on the present occasion, there could be\nno question as to whence the sound issued. It came from the fang--like\nteeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at\nthe mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the\nupturned countenances of the king and his seven companions.\n\n“Ah, ha!” said at length the infuriated jester. “Ah, ha! I begin to see\nwho these people are now!” Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more\nclosely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him,\nand which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than half\na minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the\nshrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken,\nand without the power to render them the slightest assistance.\n\nAt length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the\njester to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as\nhe made this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into\nsilence. The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke:\n\n“I now see distinctly.” he said, “what manner of people these maskers\nare. They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,--a king who\ndoes not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors\nwho abet him in the outrage. As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the\njester--and this is my last jest.”\n\nOwing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which\nit adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech\nbefore the work of vengeance was complete. The eight corpses swung in\ntheir chains, a fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable\nmass. The cripple hurled his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the\nceiling, and disappeared through the sky-light.\n\nIt is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon,\nhad been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that,\ntogether, they effected their escape to their own country: for neither\nwas seen again.\n\n","Article 2101: General Exceptions\n1.

He had\nbright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long\nbit of black india-rubber.  The little ducks were swimming about in the\npond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who\nwas pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand\non their heads in the water.\n\n“You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your\nheads,” she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them\nhow it was done.  But the little ducks paid no attention to her.  They\nwere so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in\nsociety at all.\n\n“What disobedient children!” cried the old Water-rat; “they really\ndeserve to be drowned.”\n\n“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, “every one must make a\nbeginning, and parents cannot be too patient.”\n\n“Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,” said the Water-rat;\n“I am not a family man.  In fact, I have never been married, and I never\nintend to be.  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much\nhigher.  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or\nrarer than a devoted friendship.”\n\n“And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?” asked a\nGreen Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard\nthe conversation.\n\n“Yes, that is just what I want to know,” said the Duck; and she swam away\nto the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her\nchildren a good example.\n\n“What a silly question!” cried the Water-rat.  “I should expect my\ndevoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.”\n\n“And what would you do in return?” said the little bird, swinging upon a\nsilver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.\n\n“I don’t understand you,” answered the Water-rat.\n\n“Let me tell you a story on the subject,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Is the story about me?” asked the Water-rat.  “If so, I will listen to\nit, for I am extremely fond of fiction.”\n\n“It is applicable to you,” answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and\nalighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.\n\n“Once upon a time,” said the Linnet, “there was an honest little fellow\nnamed Hans.”\n\n“Was he very distinguished?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“No,” answered the Linnet, “I don’t think he was distinguished at all,\nexcept for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.  He\nlived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his\ngarden.  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.\nSweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds’-purses, and\nFair-maids of France.  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac\nCrocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white.  Columbine and Ladysmock,\nMarjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil\nand the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the\nmonths went by, one flower taking another flower’s place, so that there\nwere always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.\n\n“Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all\nwas big Hugh the Miller.  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to\nlittle Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over\nthe wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or\nfilling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.\n\n“‘Real friends should have everything in common,’ the Miller used to say,\nand little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend\nwith such noble ideas.\n\n“Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich\nMiller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred\nsacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large\nflock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these\nthings, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the\nwonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true\nfriendship.\n\n“So little Hans worked away in his garden.  During the spring, the\nsummer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and\nhe had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good\ndeal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper\nbut a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  In the winter, also, he was\nextremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.\n\n“‘There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow\nlasts,’ the Miller used to say to his wife, ‘for when people are in\ntrouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.  That\nat least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.  So I\nshall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and\nhe will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make\nhim so happy.’\n\n“‘You are certainly very thoughtful about others,’ answered the Wife, as\nshe sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; ‘very\nthoughtful indeed.  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about\nfriendship.  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful\nthings as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear\na gold ring on his little finger.’\n\n“‘But could we not ask little Hans up here?’ said the Miller’s youngest\nson.  ‘If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and\nshow him my white rabbits.’\n\n“‘What a silly boy you are!’ cried the Miller; ‘I really don’t know what\nis the use of sending you to school.  You seem not to learn anything.\nWhy, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good\nsupper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is\na most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody’s nature.  I certainly\nwill not allow Hans’ nature to be spoiled.  I am his best friend, and I\nwill always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any\ntemptations.  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have\nsome flour on credit, and that I could not do.  Flour is one thing, and\nfriendship is another, and they should not be confused.  Why, the words\nare spelt differently, and mean quite different things.  Everybody can\nsee that.’\n\n“‘How well you talk!’ said the Miller’s Wife, pouring herself out a large\nglass of warm ale; ‘really I feel quite drowsy.  It is just like being in\nchurch.’\n\n“‘Lots of people act well,’ answered the Miller; ‘but very few people\ntalk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of\nthe two, and much the finer thing also’; and he looked sternly across the\ntable at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his\nhead down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.\nHowever, he was so young that you must excuse him.”\n\n“Is that the end of the story?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Certainly not,” answered the Linnet, “that is the beginning.”\n\n“Then you are quite behind the age,” said the Water-rat.  “Every good\nstory-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the\nbeginning, and concludes with the middle.  That is the new method.  I\nheard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the\npond with a young man.  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am\nsure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head,\nand whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered ‘Pooh!’\nBut pray go on with your story.  I like the Miller immensely.  I have all\nkinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy\nbetween us.”\n\n“Well,” said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, “as\nsoon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale\nyellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see\nlittle Hans.\n\n“‘Why, what a good heart you have!’ cried his Wife; ‘you are always\nthinking of others.  And mind you take the big basket with you for the\nflowers.’\n\n“So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron\nchain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.\n\n“‘Good morning, little Hans,’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Good morning,’ said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to\near.\n\n“‘And how have you been all the winter?’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ cried Hans, ‘it is very good of you to ask, very good\nindeed.  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring\nhas come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.’\n\n“‘We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘and\nwondered how you were getting on.’\n\n“‘That was kind of you,’ said Hans; ‘I was half afraid you had forgotten\nme.’\n\n“‘Hans, I am surprised at you,’ said the Miller; ‘friendship never\nforgets.  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don’t\nunderstand the poetry of life.  How lovely your primroses are looking,\nby-the-bye!”\n\n“‘They are certainly very lovely,’ said Hans, ‘and it is a most lucky\nthing for me that I have so many.  I am going to bring them into the\nmarket and sell them to the Burgomaster’s daughter, and buy back my\nwheelbarrow with the money.’\n\n“‘Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don’t mean to say you have sold it?\nWhat a very stupid thing to do!’\n\n“‘Well, the fact is,’ said Hans, ‘that I was obliged to.  You see the\nwinter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to\nbuy bread with.  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat,\nand then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last\nI sold my wheelbarrow.  But I am going to buy them all back again now.’\n\n“‘Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘I will give you my wheelbarrow.  It is not in\nvery good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong\nwith the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.  I\nknow it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me\nextremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the\nworld.  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and,\nbesides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.  Yes, you may set your\nmind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.’\n\n“‘Well, really, that is generous of you,’ said little Hans, and his funny\nround face glowed all over with pleasure.  ‘I can easily put it in\nrepair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.’\n\n“‘A plank of wood!’ said the Miller; ‘why, that is just what I want for\nthe roof of my barn.  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will\nall get damp if I don’t stop it up.  How lucky you mentioned it!  It is\nquite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.  I have given\nyou my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.  Of\ncourse, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true,\nfriendship never notices things like that.  Pray get it at once, and I\nwill set to work at my barn this very day.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the\nplank out.\n\n“‘It is not a very big plank,’ said the Miller, looking at it, ‘and I am\nafraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won’t be any left for\nyou to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault.\nAnd now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to\ngive me some flowers in return.  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it\nquite full.’\n\n“‘Quite full?’ said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a\nvery big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no\nflowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver\nbuttons back.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘as I have given you my\nwheelbarrow, I don’t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.\nI may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true\nfriendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.’\n\n“‘My dear friend, my best friend,’ cried little Hans, ‘you are welcome to\nall the flowers in my garden.  I would much sooner have your good opinion\nthan my silver buttons, any day’; and he ran and plucked all his pretty\nprimroses, and filled the Miller’s basket.\n\n“‘Good-bye, little Hans,’ said the Miller, as he went up the hill with\nthe plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.\n\n“‘Good-bye,’ said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he\nwas so pleased about the wheelbarrow.\n\n“The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when\nhe heard the Miller’s voice calling to him from the road.  So he jumped\noff the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.\n\n“There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘would you mind carrying this sack\nof flour for me to market?’\n\n“‘Oh, I am so sorry,’ said Hans, ‘but I am really very busy to-day.  I\nhave got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all\nmy grass to roll.’\n\n“‘Well, really,’ said the Miller, ‘I think that, considering that I am\ngoing to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to\nrefuse.’\n\n“‘Oh, don’t say that,’ cried little Hans, ‘I wouldn’t be unfriendly for\nthe whole world’; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big\nsack on his shoulders.\n\n“It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans\nhad reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down\nand rest.  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the\nmarket.  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour\nfor a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was\nafraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.\n\n“‘It has certainly been a hard day,’ said little Hans to himself as he\nwas going to bed, ‘but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is\nmy best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.’\n\n“Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his\nsack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.\n\n“‘Upon my word,’ said the Miller, ‘you are very lazy.  Really,\nconsidering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might\nwork harder.  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don’t like any of\nmy friends to be idle or sluggish.  You must not mind my speaking quite\nplainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not\nyour friend.  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say\nexactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to\nplease and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things,\nand does not mind giving pain.  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he\nprefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off\nhis night-cap, ‘but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for\na little time, and listen to the birds singing.  Do you know that I\nalways work better after hearing the birds sing?’\n\n“‘Well, I am glad of that,’ said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the\nback, ‘for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed,\nand mend my barn-roof for me.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his\nflowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse\nthe Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.\n\n“‘Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?’ he\ninquired in a shy and timid voice.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘I do not think it is much to ask\nof you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of\ncourse if you refuse I will go and do it myself.’\n\n“‘Oh! on no account,’ cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and\ndressed himself, and went up to the barn.\n\n“He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came\nto see how he was getting on.\n\n“‘Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?’ cried the\nMiller in a cheery voice.\n\n“‘It is quite mended,’ answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.\n\n“‘Ah!’ said the Miller, ‘there is no work so delightful as the work one\ndoes for others.’\n\n“‘It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,’ answered little\nHans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, ‘a very great privilege.\nBut I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.’\n\n“‘Oh! they will come to you,’ said the Miller, ‘but you must take more\npains.  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you\nwill have the theory also.’\n\n“‘Do you really think I shall?’ asked little Hans.\n\n“‘I have no doubt of it,’ answered the Miller, ‘but now that you have\nmended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive\nmy sheep to the mountain to-morrow.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next\nmorning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans\nstarted off with them to the mountain.  It took him the whole day to get\nthere and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to\nsleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.\n\n“‘What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,’ he said, and he went\nto work at once.\n\n“But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his\nfriend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long\nerrands, or getting him to help at the mill.  Little Hans was very much\ndistressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had\nforgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller\nwas his best friend.  ‘Besides,’ he used to say, ‘he is going to give me\nhis wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.’\n\n“So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds\nof beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a\nnote-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good\nscholar.\n\n“Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside\nwhen a loud rap came at the door.  It was a very wild night, and the wind\nwas blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he\nthought it was merely the storm.  But a second rap came, and then a\nthird, louder than any of the others.\n\n“‘It is some poor traveller,’ said little Hans to himself, and he ran to\nthe door.\n\n“There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the\nother.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ cried the Miller, ‘I am in great trouble.  My little\nboy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the\nDoctor.  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it\nhas just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead\nof me.  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is\nonly fair that you should do something for me in return.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, ‘I take it quite as a compliment your\ncoming to me, and I will start off at once.  But you must lend me your\nlantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the\nditch.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ answered the Miller, ‘but it is my new lantern, and\nit would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.’\n\n“‘Well, never mind, I will do without it,’ cried little Hans, and he took\ndown his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler\nround his throat, and started off.\n\n“What a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans\ncould hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely\nstand.  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking\nabout three hours, he arrived at the Doctor’s house, and knocked at the\ndoor.\n\n“‘Who is there?’ cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom\nwindow.\n\n“‘Little Hans, Doctor.’\n\n“’What do you want, little Hans?’\n\n“‘The Miller’s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and\nthe Miller wants you to come at once.’\n\n“‘All right!’ said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big\nboots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the\ndirection of the Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him.\n\n“But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and\nlittle Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.\nAt last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very\ndangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans\nwas drowned.  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating\nin a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.\n\n“Everybody went to little Hans’ funeral, as he was so popular, and the\nMiller was the chief mourner.\n\n“‘As I was his best friend,’ said the Miller, ‘it is only fair that I\nshould have the best place’; so he walked at the head of the procession\nin a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a\nbig pocket-handkerchief.\n\n“‘Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,’ said the\nBlacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated\ncomfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.\n\n“‘A great loss to me at any rate,’ answered the Miller; ‘why, I had as\ngood as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don’t know what to do\nwith it.  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair\nthat I could not get anything for it if I sold it.  I will certainly take\ncare not to give away anything again.  One always suffers for being\ngenerous.’”\n\n“Well?” said the Water-rat, after a long pause.\n\n“Well, that is the end,” said the Linnet.\n\n“But what became of the Miller?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Oh!  I really don’t know,” replied the Linnet; “and I am sure that I\ndon’t care.”\n\n“It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,” said\nthe Water-rat.\n\n“I am afraid you don’t quite see the moral of the story,” remarked the\nLinnet.\n\n“The what?” screamed the Water-rat.\n\n“The moral.”\n\n“Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?”\n\n“Certainly,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Well, really,” said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, “I think you\nshould have told me that before you began.  If you had done so, I\ncertainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said\n‘Pooh,’ like the critic.  However, I can say it now”; so he shouted out\n“Pooh” at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back\ninto his hole.\n\n“And how do you like the Water-rat?” asked the Duck, who came paddling up\nsome minutes afterwards.  “He has a great many good points, but for my\nown part I have a mother’s feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed\nbachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.”\n\n“I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,” answered the Linnet.  “The\nfact is, that I told him a story with a moral.”\n\n“Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,” said the Duck.\n\nAnd I quite agree with her.\n\n","I've got a Dungeon Master's Guide, I've got a 12-sided die.\nI've got Kitty Pryde, and Nightcrawler too, waiting there for me.\nYes I do, I do.\n\nI've got posters on the wall, my favorite rock group KISS.\nI've got Ace Frehley, and I've got Peter Criss waiting there for me.\nYes I do, I do\n\nI've got an electric guitar.\nI play my stupid songs.\nI write these stupid words, and I love every one waiting there for me.\nYes I do, I do\n\nIn the garage, I feel safe.\nNo one cares about my ways.\nIn the garage where I belong, no one hears me sing this song.\nIn the garage.\n\n","EVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go\nand play in the Giant’s garden.\n\nIt was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass.  Here and there over\nthe grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve\npeach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of\npink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit.  The birds sat on the\ntrees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in\norder to listen to them.  “How happy we are here!” they cried to each\nother.\n\n\nOne day the Giant came back.  He had been to visit his friend the Cornish\nogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.  After the seven years\nwere over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was\nlimited, and he determined to return to his own castle.  When he arrived\nhe saw the children playing in the garden.\n\n“What are you doing here?” he cried in a very gruff voice, and the\nchildren ran away.\n\n“My own garden is my own garden,” said the Giant; “any one can understand\nthat, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.”  So he built a\nhigh wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.\n\nTRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED\n\nHe was a very selfish Giant.\n\nThe poor children had now nowhere to play.  They tried to play on the\nroad, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did\nnot like it.  They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons\nwere over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.  “How happy we\nwere there,” they said to each other.\n\nThen the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms\nand little birds.  Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still\nwinter.  The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children,\nand the trees forgot to blossom.  Once a beautiful flower put its head\nout from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for\nthe children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to\nsleep.  The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost.\n“Spring has forgotten this garden,” they cried, “so we will live here all\nthe year round.”  The Snow covered up the grass with her great white\ncloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver.  Then they invited the\nNorth Wind to stay with them, and he came.  He was wrapped in furs, and\nhe roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down.\n“This is a delightful spot,” he said, “we must ask the Hail on a visit.”\nSo the Hail came.  Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of\nthe castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and\nround the garden as fast as he could go.  He was dressed in grey, and his\nbreath was like ice.\n\n“I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,” said the\nSelfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white\ngarden; “I hope there will be a change in the weather.”\n\nBut the Spring never came, nor the Summer.  The Autumn gave golden fruit\nto every garden, but to the Giant’s garden she gave none.  “He is too\nselfish,” she said.  So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind,\nand the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.\n\nOne morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely\nmusic.  It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the\nKing’s musicians passing by.  It was really only a little linnet singing\noutside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in\nhis garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the\nworld.  Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind\nceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open\ncasement.  “I believe the Spring has come at last,” said the Giant; and\nhe jumped out of bed and looked out.\n\nWhat did he see?\n\nHe saw a most wonderful sight.  Through a little hole in the wall the\nchildren had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the\ntrees.  In every tree that he could see there was a little child.  And\nthe trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had\ncovered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above\nthe children’s heads.  The birds were flying about and twittering with\ndelight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and\nlaughing.  It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter.\nIt was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little\nboy.  He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the\ntree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.  The poor tree\nwas still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was\nblowing and roaring above it.  “Climb up! little boy,” said the Tree, and\nit bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.\n\nAnd the Giant’s heart melted as he looked out.  “How selfish I have\nbeen!” he said; “now I know why the Spring would not come here.  I will\nput that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock\ndown the wall, and my garden shall be the children’s playground for ever\nand ever.”  He was really very sorry for what he had done.\n\nSo he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went\nout into the garden.  But when the children saw him they were so\nfrightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.\nOnly the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that\nhe did not see the Giant coming.  And the Giant stole up behind him and\ntook him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.  And the tree\nbroke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the\nlittle boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant’s\nneck, and kissed him.  And the other children, when they saw that the\nGiant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came\nthe Spring.  “It is your garden now, little children,” said the Giant,\nand he took a great axe and knocked down the wall.  And when the people\nwere going to market at twelve o’clock they found the Giant playing with\nthe children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.\n\nAll day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to\nbid him good-bye.\n\n“But where is your little companion?” he said: “the boy I put into the\ntree.”  The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.\n\n“We don’t know,” answered the children; “he has gone away.”\n\n“You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,” said the Giant.\nBut the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had\nnever seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.\n\nEvery afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with\nthe Giant.  But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.\nThe Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first\nlittle friend, and often spoke of him.  “How I would like to see him!” he\nused to say.\n\nYears went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble.  He could not\nplay about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the\nchildren at their games, and admired his garden.  “I have many beautiful\nflowers,” he said; “but the children are the most beautiful flowers of\nall.”\n\nOne winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing.  He\ndid not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring\nasleep, and that the flowers were resting.\n\nSuddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked.  It\ncertainly was a marvellous sight.  In the farthest corner of the garden\nwas a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.  Its branches were\nall golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood\nthe little boy he had loved.\n\nDownstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden.  He\nhastened across the grass, and came near to the child.  And when he came\nquite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, “Who hath dared to\nwound thee?”  For on the palms of the child’s hands were the prints of\ntwo nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.\n\n“Who hath dared to wound thee?” cried the Giant; “tell me, that I may\ntake my big sword and slay him.”\n\n“Nay!” answered the child; “but these are the wounds of Love.”\n\n“Who art thou?” said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he\nknelt before the little child.\n\nAnd the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, “You let me play once\nin your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is\nParadise.”\n\nAnd when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying\ndead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.\n\n","Hi.\nHi!

Are you gonna be okay?\nYeah I think so.\nI wasn’t talking to you.\nI’ll be okay.\nOkay, I’ll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour.\nBye dad.\nBye. So this is fun, huh?\nNot really.\nOkay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?\nOkay.\nUh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?\nI’m not allowed to have soda.\nOkay. Well that’s pretty much all that we have—Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?\nWhat’s a virgin?\nWater it is.\nWhat about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.\nYou mean the spitter?\nCome on! It wasn’t that bad!\nEasy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil.\nAll right, what about the third guy?\nYou mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?\nCan you blame him?\nSorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say, \"I do,\" he’s thinking, \"Yeah, I’d do her too!\"\nWell then we still have a problem.\nYeah!\nWith what?\nWell, we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they’re all either boring or annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at the ladies.\nOo! You should have one of us do it!\nPhoebe, we’re getting married, married; not sixth grade married.\nNo! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!\nAre you serious?\nYes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal!\nI call it!!\nWhat?! No! It was my idea!\nGuys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.\nDoes calling it not mean anything anymore?!\nWe are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!\nBen y’know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. ‘Cause I was, I was your daddy’s girlfriend.\nBut you’re not anymore!\nNo, I’m not.\n‘Cause you guys were on a break.\nHey! We were not on a—Okay. That’s fine! Fine. Y’know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?\nWhen’s my daddy coming back?\nSo no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don’t have to share stuff.\nSharing is good.\nOh, you’re one of those. But y’know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.\nReally? Like how?\nWell y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal.\nThat’s a good one.\nYeah? You like that one?\nYeah, you’re funny.\nI’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they’re left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.\nCan I do it to you?\nYeah, I-I-I-I’m funny Ben, but I’m not stupid. Okay?\nSo, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?\nNo, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.\nWe’re never gonna find anybody.\nWell then let me do it!\nJoe…\nNo-no-no! Look, I’ve been thinking about it. I’m an actor right? So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people.\nJoey look it’s really sweet…\nNo-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone knows I’m an ass man!\nThat is true.\nYeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a really good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.\nY’know, we haven’t found anybody else.\nIt might be kinda cool.\nSo I can do it?\nYeah you can do it.\nAll right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?\nYeah.\nOkay.\nHey Pheebs, how’s it going?\nOh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!\nOh, I’m sorry. Can I get you something?\nOh my God, you’ve got to stop chattering!\nHere, take a couple of these.\nWhat is it?\nIt’s Hexadrin.\nOh no, I don’t believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here.\nOkay, while we’re waiting for these pills to kick in, I’m gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. —gonna make you some tea. And then, I’m gonna rub your feet.\nOh.\nOh! My head! Oh! Oh!\nComing.\nI have a bone to pick with you.\nUh-oh.\nYes! Ben learned a little trick.\nOh yeah? Did he pull the old…\nThat’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!\nOh that.\nYeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!\nOh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don’t think that’s just a little funny?!\nI was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?\nYes.\nIt’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?\nHexadrin.\nOh, I love you Hexadrin!\nNo Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.\nSay what?\nY’know, the possible side affects.\nOh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache—Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I’m sorry, extra strength death capsules!\nPhoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!\nWhy?\nIn case it happens.\nHey!\nHey!\nSay hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!\nHey!\nYou did it! You got ordained?!\nYeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!\nOur minister…\nI have liver damage. Ow! Oh!\nPhoebe, your liver is right here.\nOkay, then I must be disoriented.\nAnyway, I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?\nOkay.\nYeah!\nNow-now, listen this is just a first draft so… \"We too can share and love and have and receive.\"\nShould we call the spitter?\nHey Rachel!\nHi!\nWhat a nice surprise! What are you doing here?\nWell y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, \"What’s up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?\"\nCan I ask what—Come on in.\nOkay.\nUmm uh, I’ll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.\nI’d love that. I would loooove… So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...\nI found him! That is exactly why I’ve come here to talk to you okay?\nRach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?\nYes oh— Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?\nRemember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?\nDon’t do that.\nDon’t do that.\nSeriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks.\nSeriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks.\nOh damnit!\nOh damnit!\nNo! Don’t say that! Don’t say that!\nDamnit!\nNo don’t! Go back to repeating!\nDamnit!\nOh crap!\nOh crap!\nI feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?\nPhoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!\nOh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!\nOkay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?\nYeah. O-okay.\nHow about receiving?\nYes!\nSee Joe, not that that’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!\nOoh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?\nNo, not us…\nI gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?\nDid you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?\nIt doesn’t say that!\nOh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!\nSee Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. Nice stories.\nOh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, \"Began their beautiful journey…\"\nThere you go!\n\"…by doin’ it.\"\nJoe?\nOkay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together and she’s feeding you strawberries?\nIsn’t that what happened with you and the bride’s maid?\nYeah!! I call that London style.\nNo that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross’s mom.\nOh.\nAnd then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much…\nYeah baby!\nAnd I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.\nOh.\nBut then later that night…\nYeah baby!\nHey!\nCute PJ’s! You’re really livin’ it up here in London huh?\nWell I was… I was exactly expecting company after… 9:15.\nIs Joey here?\nWell, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?\nWouldn’t you be?\nWell, look it’s been a really emotional time y’know, and you’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!\nReally?\nYou kidding? You’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms… Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?\nWell, not anymore.\nBut we don’t do that.\nI know, I just thought it would be fun.\nHow drunk are you?\nDrunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.\nThat’s the perfect amount!\nOkay!\nY’know what’s weird?\nWhat?\nThis doesn’t feel weird!\nI know.\nYou’re a really good kisser.\nWell, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?\nHm-hmm!\nOkay!\nWow! You are really fast!\nIt bodes well for me that speed impresses you.\nWe’re gonna see each other naked.\nYep!\nDo you wanna do it at the same time?\nCount of three?\nOne!\nTwo!\nTwo!\nThree!\nWell I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.\nEh, we weren’t that close anyway!\nEh!\nJoey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!\nHey!\nHey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e…\nOh, dude I’m so sorry!\nNo! No! No!\nHey no-no-no-no! It’s cool! It’s cool! I-I’ll only be a second, I’m still with my bride’s maid, I just—Where are those condoms you brought?\nThey’re in my bag over there.\nAh.\nUh, could you leave me one?\nFor just you?\nYeah.\nHey listen, why don’t you come downstairs with me? There’s some really nice girls down there.\nNo I-I-I’m fine.\nAll right, here you go buddy.\nThat’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.\nOkay, can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing nothing for me.\nOh… Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last one? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars!\nYeah, it’s totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.\nWhat?!\nWhat?\nWhat?!\nWho did you originally want to hook up with?\nOkay, fine but please don’t be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted…just sex. So, when I…went to your room that night…I was actually looking…for Joey.\nYeah baby! No baby!\nSo you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?\nNo because it-it didn’t seem important.\nOh, it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it wasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d be marrying him not me!\nNoo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!\nAnd it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv—\nI don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I’m runner up.\nChandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!\nHey! Now I’m a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!\nLook there is no way you’re doing this wedding now. Okay?\nWhat?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my bride’s maid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?! I mean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!\nOkay, it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I don’t know what I need. I need a walk.\nWait Chandler come on, let’s—it’s not a big deal!\nIt is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.\nThis is crazy.\nI know! Robin is so gay!\nSo now what have we agreed?\nNo more pranks.\nAnd-and what else?\nThat you and daddy were not on a break.\nVery good.\nRachel! What are you doing here?\nI’m just visiting my good friend Carol.\nYour good friend?\nYeah!\nWhat’s her last name?\nCarol…Lesbian?\nNice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?\nWhat line?\nWh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, \"Dude, don’t you ever was your face?\"\nAll right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!\nOf course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s not funny!\nHey Ross!\nHi.\nWhat’s not funny?\nPractical jokes.\nOh I…I think they’re funny.\nYou have a line down your face.\nWhat?\nOkay, maybe they are not funny to you…\nOh my God!\nOr Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!\nUh, y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!\nThat was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, \"I will be revenged?!\"\nI will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?\nFine. Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!\nNo that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I…\nLook he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!\nCrap!!\nI gotta go!\nHey.\nHey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!\nChandler, come on nothing even happened!\nLook Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding…\nNo-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I except that. I don’t care about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset.\nHow can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!\nYeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever.\nThat’s what you should say.\nWhat?\nWhen you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.\nReally? I can do it?\nI’d love it if you would do it.\nHey!\nBut those are the words! Those exact words!\nWell I don’t know remember exactly but, it’s-it’s pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.\nHey!\nHey!\nHey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel, so…\nOhhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don’t we Ben?\nOkay, I’ll see you later pal.\nOhh, okay. Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can’t do it.\nWhat?\nI can’t let him go out that way, he’s got a meeting. You’ve got something here on your back.\nWhat? What did we just finish talking about Ben?!\nOh I…\nWhat did we just finish talking about Ben?!\nAll right, that’s it! Come—you—no! You are in big trouble young man!\nNo! Wait! Come on!\nWait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!\nNo you guys…\nI-I-am—\nEHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!\nHey!\nHey-hey.\nSo are guys doing okay?\nYeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.\nYeah baby!\nI’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.\nHoney! Dinner’s ready!\nWhat’s my little chef got for me tonight?\nYour favorite!\nHo-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!\nYep! And lot’s of it!\nThanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.\nOkay, in we go.\nHere we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin’?\nHere you go.\nThat’s it! I’m out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!\nGood for you!\nOh, it’s like huge weight has been lifted! ‘Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I’m just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria—Oh.\n","The world has turned and left me here.\nJust where I was before you appeared, and in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face.\n\nI just made love with your sweet memory one thousand times in my head.\nYou said you loved it more than ever.\n\nYou remain turned away, turning further every day.\n\nI talked for hours to your wallet photograph and you just listened.\nYou laughed enchanted by intellect, or maybe you didn't.\n\nYou remain turned away, turning further every day.\n\n","If you wake up and don't want to smile, if it take just a little while, open your eyes and look at the day.\nYou'll see things in a different way.\n\nDon't stop thinking about tomorrow.\nDon't stop, it'll soon be here.\nIt'll be better than before.\nYesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.\n\nWhy not think about times to come, and not about the things that you've done.\nIf your life was bad to you, just think what tomorrow will do.\n\nAll I want is to see you smile, if it takes just a little while.\nI know you don't believe that it's true. I never meant any harm to you.\n\n","Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.\nBetrothed…\n…betrothed couple.\nHey!\nHey!\nHi!\nHaaaa... ... ahhhh!\nPheebs?\nHuh?\nSkull?\nOh, yeah, it's my mom's.\nOh my god!!\nNo, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.\nHey!\nHey!\nLicorice?\nHey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.\nOhh! That's great!\nAre you gonna dress up as Santa?\nNope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.\nAnd maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.\nYou may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.\nHmm.\nHey.\nDid you know he was in there?\nNo.\nHow long have we been home?\nAbout a half an hour.\nLovely!\nHey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?\nNo.\nWhy not?\nBing's weird.\nOh, hey, you guys!\nHey!\nHey!\nHey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.\nAhh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!\nYes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.\nOhh! You guys gonna be living together again?\nYeah, why not?\nWell, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.\nWhy do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?\nNo reason, except…she…told…me.\nReally? So she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?\nNo! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.\nPhoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.\nYou're sure? You're absolutely sure?\nWell, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.\nProbably? Yeah, I don't like that word.\nBing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?\nHey!\nHey! Great, you’re home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!\nDrums?\nNo! Drums!I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.\nOh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.\nForty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.\nI'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.\nIs this because of the burrito thing?\nYou need to give him money.\nGive him money? It was a joke!\nNo, to get a table! Places like are always shakin’ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.\nRight, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.\nYou've got to be smooth about it.\nHey, I can be smooth.\nOf course, sir.\nOkay.\nHow did it go?\nHad the money in the wrong hand.\nWooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?\nNo.\nWell, I do, so let's... So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?\nChristmas.\nYep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?\nChristmas eve.\nYes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.\nSanta has reindeers that can fly!\nRight, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.\nJingle bells, jingle bells...\nDreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.\nRudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...\nOkay, it's not a contest.\nWhen is Santa coming?\nWell, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?\nNo Santa? Was I bad?\nNo! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.\nSanta's mad at me.\nNo, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!\nSo Santa's coming?\nYes! Santa's coming!\nIt's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!\nHow do you know so much about this?\nI don't know.\nRichard used to do it, didn't he?\nWe'd be eating our soup right now.\nMustached bastard…\nOkay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!\nExcuse me...\nMale Guest:Ha!\nSo you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!\nHey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...\nTequila!!\nThat's fun.\nHere you go.\nThank you Gunther, put it there. Thank you.\nThank you. Hey Pheebs!\nHey!\nHere. Now I only owe you $49.50.\nHey Pheebs!\nHey!\nIf you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?\nIt's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, \"Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!\" I mean, it is so annoying.\nYes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.\nPhoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?\nMaybe on some level.\nJoey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.\nWhat is Rock 'n' Roll about that?\nOh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?\nIt's a…tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?\nWhat are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?\nIs it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!\nOh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.\nWhat? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?\nOur apartment is ready.\nAnd that makes you angry because…\nBecause you would rather live here with Joey.\nWhere did you get that?\nMonica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.\nPhoebe?\nHm?\nDid you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!\nFish!\nIt wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.\nYes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here…\nOh, it's so much more fun with you.\nWe did have fun, didn't we?\nWe did!\nOh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.\nOh, I would love to!\nYay, okay!\nGood, good, good, good, good.\nGreat, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.\nDone!\nHey!\nHello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?\nNo, these are my pants.\nOh. Okay! How can I help you?\nWell, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?\nTwo days before Christmas? Sorry, man.\nOkay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something.\nI'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!\nWhat happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?\nSanta was unavailable so close to Christmas.\nWow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from…Texas.\nTexas?\nThat's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.\nWow! Thanks!\nYou're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!\nAre you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.\nYou are? Me, too!\nBecause Armadillos also wandered in the desert?\nOoh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?\nCool!\nYeah!\nCome on Ben.\nYears and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...\nHo, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!\nSanta!\nHey!\nWhat are you doing here, Santa?\nWell, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?\nI'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?\nWhat?\nDid you bring me any presents, Santa?\nYou bet I did, Ben, put it there! Ho, ho, ho!\nOkay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.\nWhat are you doing?\nYou called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!\nThank you, but, but you gotta leave.\nWhy?\nBecause, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you’re wrecking it.\nBut I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.\nI'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.\nFine, I'll give the suit back.Santa? Really?\nYes, is that okay?\nDid your Dad ever dress up like Santa?\nNo.\nThen it's okay!\nOkay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!\nNo!

I want Santa!\nFine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.\nWell, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?\nOkay, Santa!\nAll right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.\nMerry Christmas!\nOh wow! Look at this place!\nOh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!\nOh my God!\nWhat?\nOkay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?\nYeah?\nAnd remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?\nYeah?\nDo you really not know where I’m going with this? It left! It’s one huge room!\nOh no! Oh! Wow!!!\nSee?\nWell, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up.\nYou can’t, because of the new skylight!\nThere’s a skylight?!

Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?\nNo, I do not hear that.\n…and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for…\nEight whole days.\nThat’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.\nAwesome!\nYeah?\nMy favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.\nThe Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles!\nHey!\nOh.\nWow! It looks like the Easter Bunny’s funeral in here.\nCome on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!\nOh.\nOh.\nOkay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?\nI got it!\nIs it back in the cage?\nIts back in cage!\nCage closed?\nJoey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!\n","HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy\nPrince.  He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes\nhe had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his\nsword-hilt.\n\nHe was very much admired indeed.  “He is as beautiful as a weathercock,”\nremarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for\nhaving artistic tastes; “only not quite so useful,” he added, fearing\nlest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\n\n“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince?” asked a sensible mother of her\nlittle boy who was crying for the moon.  “The Happy Prince never dreams\nof crying for anything.”\n\n“I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,” muttered a\ndisappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\n\n“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came out\nof the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white\npinafores.\n\n“How do you know?” said the Mathematical Master, “you have never seen\none.”\n\n“Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the\nMathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not\napprove of children dreaming.\n\nOne night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had\ngone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was\nin love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring\nas he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so\nattracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\n\n“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at\nonce, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her,\ntouching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was\nhis courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\n\n“It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; “she has\nno money, and far too many relations”; and indeed the river was quite\nfull of Reeds.  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.\n\nAfter they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love.\n“She has no conversation,” he said, “and I am afraid that she is a\ncoquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.”  And certainly,\nwhenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.  “I\nadmit that she is domestic,” he continued, “but I love travelling, and my\nwife, consequently, should love travelling also.”\n\n“Will you come away with me?” he said finally to her; but the Reed shook\nher head, she was so attached to her home.\n\n“You have been trifling with me,” he cried.  “I am off to the Pyramids.\nGood-bye!” and he flew away.\n\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.  “Where\nshall I put up?” he said; “I hope the town has made preparations.”\n\nThen he saw the statue on the tall column.\n\n“I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a fine position, with plenty of\nfresh air.”  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.\n\n“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to himself as he looked round,\nand he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under\nhis wing a large drop of water fell on him.  “What a curious thing!” he\ncried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear\nand bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is\nreally dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her\nselfishness.”\n\nThen another drop fell.\n\n“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?” he said; “I\nmust look for a good chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away.\n\nBut before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up,\nand saw—Ah! what did he see?\n\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were\nrunning down his golden cheeks.  His face was so beautiful in the\nmoonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.\n\n“Who are you?” he said.\n\n“I am the Happy Prince.”\n\n“Why are you weeping then?” asked the Swallow; “you have quite drenched\nme.”\n\n“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue, “I did not\nknow what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where\nsorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my\ncompanions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great\nHall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask\nwhat lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers\ncalled me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be\nhappiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have\nset me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery\nof my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but\nweep.”\n\n“What! is he not solid gold?” said the Swallow to himself.  He was too\npolite to make any personal remarks out loud.\n\n“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away in a\nlittle street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and\nthrough it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and\nworn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she\nis a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for\nthe loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next\nCourt-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying\nill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing\nto give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little\nSwallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet\nare fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow.  “My friends are flying up\nand down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.  Soon they\nwill go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.  The King is there\nhimself in his painted coffin.  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and\nembalmed with spices.  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and\nhis hands are like withered leaves.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and\nthe mother so sad.”\n\n“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow.  “Last summer, when I\nwas staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons,\nwho were always throwing stones at me.  They never hit me, of course; we\nswallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family\nfamous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.”\n\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.\n“It is very cold here,” he said; “but I will stay with you for one night,\nand be your messenger.”\n\n“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince.\n\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword, and\nflew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\n\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were\nsculptured.  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.  A\nbeautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.  “How wonderful\nthe stars are,” he said to her, “and how wonderful is the power of love!”\n\n“I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,” she answered;\n“I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the\nseamstresses are so lazy.”\n\nHe passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of\nthe ships.  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining\nwith each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.  At last he\ncame to the poor house and looked in.  The boy was tossing feverishly on\nhis bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.  In he\nhopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble.\nThen he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy’s forehead with his\nwings.  “How cool I feel,” said the boy, “I must be getting better”; and\nhe sank into a delicious slumber.\n\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had\ndone.  “It is curious,” he remarked, “but I feel quite warm now, although\nit is so cold.”\n\n“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince.  And the\nlittle Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.  Thinking always\nmade him sleepy.\n\nWhen day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  “What a\nremarkable phenomenon,” said the Professor of Ornithology as he was\npassing over the bridge.  “A swallow in winter!”  And he wrote a long\nletter about it to the local newspaper.  Every one quoted it, it was full\nof so many words that they could not understand.\n\n“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at\nthe prospect.  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time\non top of the church steeple.  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped,\nand said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger!” so he enjoyed\nhimself very much.\n\nWhen the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  “Have you any\ncommissions for Egypt?” he cried; “I am just starting.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me one night longer?”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow.  “To-morrow my friends\nwill fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among\nthe bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All\nnight long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he\nutters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions\ncome down to the water’s edge to drink.  They have eyes like green\nberyls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away across the\ncity I see a young man in a garret.  He is leaning over a desk covered\nwith papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered\nviolets.  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a\npomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.  He is trying to finish a\nplay for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any\nmore.  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.”\n\n“I will wait with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, who really had\na good heart.  “Shall I take him another ruby?”\n\n“Alas!  I have no ruby now,” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that I\nhave left.  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of\nIndia a thousand years ago.  Pluck out one of them and take it to him.\nHe will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish\nhis play.”\n\n“Dear Prince,” said the Swallow, “I cannot do that”; and he began to\nweep.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\nyou.”\n\nSo the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and flew away to the\nstudent’s garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in\nthe roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room.  The young man\nhad his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the\nbird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying\non the withered violets.\n\n“I am beginning to be appreciated,” he cried; “this is from some great\nadmirer.  Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy.\n\nThe next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of\na large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold\nwith ropes.  “Heave a-hoy!” they shouted as each chest came up.  “I am\ngoing to Egypt”! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon\nrose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\n\n“I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me one night longer?”\n\n“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon be\nhere.  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the\ncrocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  My companions are\nbuilding a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves\nare watching them, and cooing to each other.  Dear Prince, I must leave\nyou, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back\ntwo beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.  The ruby\nshall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the\ngreat sea.”\n\n“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little\nmatch-girl.  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all\nspoiled.  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money,\nand she is crying.  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is\nbare.  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will\nnot beat her.”\n\n“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, “but I cannot\npluck out your eye.  You would be quite blind then.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\nyou.”\n\nSo he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down with it.  He\nswooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her\nhand.  “What a lovely bit of glass,” cried the little girl; and she ran\nhome, laughing.\n\nThen the Swallow came back to the Prince.  “You are blind now,” he said,\n“so I will stay with you always.”\n\n“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away to Egypt.”\n\n“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the\nPrince’s feet.\n\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him stories of\nwhat he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who\nstand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their\nbeaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the\ndesert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the\nside of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King\nof the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a\nlarge crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and\nhas twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who\nsail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the\nbutterflies.\n\n“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous\nthings, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of\nwomen.  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.  Fly over my city, little\nSwallow, and tell me what you see there.”\n\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in\ntheir beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He\nflew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children\nlooking out listlessly at the black streets.  Under the archway of a\nbridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep\nthemselves warm.  “How hungry we are!” they said.  “You must not lie\nhere,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\n\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\n\n“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it off,\nleaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold\ncan make them happy.”\n\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy\nPrince looked quite dull and grey.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he\nbrought to the poor, and the children’s faces grew rosier, and they\nlaughed and played games in the street.  “We have bread now!” they cried.\n\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  The streets\nlooked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and\nglistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of\nthe houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore\nscarlet caps and skated on the ice.\n\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave\nthe Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the\nbaker’s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself\nwarm by flapping his wings.\n\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die.  He had just strength to\nfly up to the Prince’s shoulder once more.  “Good-bye, dear Prince!” he\nmurmured, “will you let me kiss your hand?”\n\n“I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,” said the\nPrince, “you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips,\nfor I love you.”\n\n“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the Swallow.  “I am going to\nthe House of Death.  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?”\n\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his\nfeet.\n\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something\nhad broken.  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.\nIt certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\n\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in\ncompany with the Town Councillors.  As they passed the column he looked\nup at the statue: “Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!” he said.\n\n“How shabby indeed!” cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with\nthe Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\n\n“The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is\ngolden no longer,” said the Mayor in fact, “he is litttle better than a\nbeggar!”\n\n“Little better than a beggar,” said the Town Councillors.\n\n“And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!” continued the Mayor.  “We\nmust really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die\nhere.”  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.\n\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.  “As he is no longer\nbeautiful he is no longer useful,” said the Art Professor at the\nUniversity.\n\nThen they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of\nthe Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.  “We must\nhave another statue, of course,” he said, “and it shall be a statue of\nmyself.”\n\n“Of myself,” said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.\nWhen I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.\n\n“What a strange thing!” said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.\n“This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.  We must throw it\naway.”  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also\nlying.\n\n“Bring me the two most precious things in the city,” said God to one of\nHis Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.\n\n“You have rightly chosen,” said God, “for in my garden of Paradise this\nlittle bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy\nPrince shall praise me.”\n\n","Article 2101: General Exceptions\n1.

Withdrawing the stem of his pipe from the dental\nnotch in which it habitually rested, he leaned back in the recess behind\nhim and smiled into the fire.  The smile was neither mirthful nor sad,\nnot precisely humorous nor altogether thoughtful.  We who knew him\nrecognized it in a moment: it was his narrative smile.  Breaking off our\nfew desultory remarks we drew up closer, and he thus began:--\n\n'My father, as you mid know, was a shepherd all his life, and lived out\nby the Cove four miles yonder, where I was born and lived likewise, till\nI moved here shortly afore I was married.  The cottage that first knew me\nstood on the top of the down, near the sea; there was no house within a\nmile and a half of it; it was built o' purpose for the farm-shepherd, and\nhad no other use.  They tell me that it is now pulled down, but that you\ncan see where it stood by the mounds of earth and a few broken bricks\nthat are still lying about.  It was a bleak and dreary place in winter-\ntime, but in summer it was well enough, though the garden never came to\nmuch, because we could not get up a good shelter for the vegetables and\ncurrant bushes; and where there is much wind they don't thrive.\n\n'Of all the years of my growing up the ones that bide clearest in my mind\nwere eighteen hundred and three, four, and five.  This was for two\nreasons: I had just then grown to an age when a child's eyes and ears\ntake in and note down everything about him, and there was more at that\ndate to bear in mind than there ever has been since with me.  It was, as\nI need hardly tell ye, the time after the first peace, when Bonaparte was\nscheming his descent upon England.  He had crossed the great Alp\nmountains, fought in Egypt, drubbed the Turks, the Austrians, and the\nProossians, and now thought he'd have a slap at us.  On the other side of\nthe Channel, scarce out of sight and hail of a man standing on our\nEnglish shore, the French army of a hundred and sixty thousand men and\nfifteen thousand horses had been brought together from all parts, and\nwere drilling every day.  Bonaparte had been three years a-making his\npreparations; and to ferry these soldiers and cannon and horses across he\nhad contrived a couple of thousand flat-bottomed boats.  These boats were\nsmall things, but wonderfully built.  A good few of 'em were so made as\nto have a little stable on board each for the two horses that were to\nhaul the cannon carried at the stern.  To get in order all these, and\nother things required, he had assembled there five or six thousand\nfellows that worked at trades--carpenters, blacksmiths, wheelwrights,\nsaddlers, and what not.  O 'twas a curious time!\n\n'Every morning Neighbour Boney would muster his multitude of soldiers on\nthe beach, draw 'em up in line, practise 'em in the manoeuvre of\nembarking, horses and all, till they could do it without a single hitch.\nMy father drove a flock of ewes up into Sussex that year, and as he went\nalong the drover's track over the high downs thereabout he could see this\ndrilling actually going on--the accoutrements of the rank and file\nglittering in the sun like silver.  It was thought and always said by my\nuncle Job, sergeant of foot (who used to know all about these matters),\nthat Bonaparte meant to cross with oars on a calm night.  The grand query\nwith us was, Where would my gentleman land?  Many of the common people\nthought it would be at Dover; others, who knew how unlikely it was that\nany skilful general would make a business of landing just where he was\nexpected, said he'd go either east into the River Thames, or west'ard to\nsome convenient place, most likely one of the little bays inside the Isle\nof Portland, between the Beal and St. Alban's Head--and for choice the\nthree-quarter-round Cove, screened from every mortal eye, that seemed\nmade o' purpose, out by where we lived, and which I've climmed up with\ntwo tubs of brandy across my shoulders on scores o' dark nights in my\nyounger days.  Some had heard that a part o' the French fleet would sail\nright round Scotland, and come up the Channel to a suitable haven.\nHowever, there was much doubt upon the matter; and no wonder, for after-\nyears proved that Bonaparte himself could hardly make up his mind upon\nthat great and very particular point, where to land.  His uncertainty\ncame about in this wise, that he could get no news as to where and how\nour troops lay in waiting, and that his knowledge of possible places\nwhere flat-bottomed boats might be quietly run ashore, and the men they\nbrought marshalled in order, was dim to the last degree.  Being\nflat-bottomed, they didn't require a harbour for unshipping their cargo\nof men, but a good shelving beach away from sight, and with a fair open\nroad toward London.  How the question posed that great Corsican tyrant\n(as we used to call him), what pains he took to settle it, and, above\nall, what a risk he ran on one particular night in trying to do so, were\nknown only to one man here and there; and certainly to no maker of\nnewspapers or printer of books, or my account o't would not have had so\nmany heads shaken over it as it has by gentry who only believe what they\nsee in printed lines.\n\n'The flocks my father had charge of fed all about the downs near our\nhouse, overlooking the sea and shore each way for miles.  In winter and\nearly spring father was up a deal at nights, watching and tending the\nlambing.  Often he'd go to bed early, and turn out at twelve or one; and\non the other hand, he'd sometimes stay up till twelve or one, and then\nturn in to bed.  As soon as I was old enough I used to help him, mostly\nin the way of keeping an eye upon the ewes while he was gone home to\nrest.  This is what I was doing in a particular month in either the year\nfour or five--I can't certainly fix which, but it was long before I was\ntook away from the sheepkeeping to be bound prentice to a trade.  Every\nnight at that time I was at the fold, about half a mile, or it may be a\nlittle more, from our cottage, and no living thing at all with me but the\newes and young lambs.  Afeard?  No; I was never afeard of being alone at\nthese times; for I had been reared in such an out-step place that the\nlack o' human beings at night made me less fearful than the sight of 'em.\nDirectly I saw a man's shape after dark in a lonely place I was\nfrightened out of my senses.\n\n'One day in that month we were surprised by a visit from my uncle Job,\nthe sergeant in the Sixty-first foot, then in camp on the downs above\nKing George's watering-place, several miles to the west yonder.  Uncle\nJob dropped in about dusk, and went up with my father to the fold for an\nhour or two.  Then he came home, had a drop to drink from the tub of\nsperrits that the smugglers kept us in for housing their liquor when\nthey'd made a run, and for burning 'em off when there was danger.  After\nthat he stretched himself out on the settle to sleep.  I went to bed: at\none o'clock father came home, and waking me to go and take his place,\naccording to custom, went to bed himself.  On my way out of the house I\npassed Uncle Job on the settle.  He opened his eyes, and upon my telling\nhim where I was going he said it was a shame that such a youngster as I\nshould go up there all alone; and when he had fastened up his stock and\nwaist-belt he set off along with me, taking a drop from the sperrit-tub\nin a little flat bottle that stood in the corner-cupboard.\n\n'By and by we drew up to the fold, saw that all was right, and then, to\nkeep ourselves warm, curled up in a heap of straw that lay inside the\nthatched hurdles we had set up to break the stroke of the wind when there\nwas any.  To-night, however, there was none.  It was one of those very\nstill nights when, if you stand on the high hills anywhere within two or\nthree miles of the sea, you can hear the rise and fall of the tide along\nthe shore, coming and going every few moments like a sort of great snore\nof the sleeping world.  Over the lower ground there was a bit of a mist,\nbut on the hill where we lay the air was clear, and the moon, then in her\nlast quarter, flung a fairly good light on the grass and scattered straw.\n\n'While we lay there Uncle Job amused me by telling me strange stories of\nthe wars he had served in and the wounds he had got.  He had already\nfought the French in the Low Countries, and hoped to fight 'em again.  His\nstories lasted so long that at last I was hardly sure that I was not a\nsoldier myself, and had seen such service as he told of.  The wonders of\nhis tales quite bewildered my mind, till I fell asleep and dreamed of\nbattle, smoke, and flying soldiers, all of a kind with the doings he had\nbeen bringing up to me.\n\n'How long my nap lasted I am not prepared to say.  But some faint sounds\nover and above the rustle of the ewes in the straw, the bleat of the\nlambs, and the tinkle of the sheep-bell brought me to my waking senses.\nUncle Job was still beside me; but he too had fallen asleep.  I looked\nout from the straw, and saw what it was that had aroused me.  Two men, in\nboat-cloaks, cocked hats, and swords, stood by the hurdles about twenty\nyards off.\n\n'I turned my ear thitherward to catch what they were saying, but though I\nheard every word o't, not one did I understand.  They spoke in a tongue\nthat was not ours--in French, as I afterward found.  But if I could not\ngain the meaning of a word, I was shrewd boy enough to find out a deal of\nthe talkers' business.  By the light o' the moon I could see that one of\n'em carried a roll of paper in his hand, while every moment he spoke\nquick to his comrade, and pointed right and left with the other hand to\nspots along the shore.  There was no doubt that he was explaining to the\nsecond gentleman the shapes and features of the coast.  What happened\nsoon after made this still clearer to me.\n\n'All this time I had not waked Uncle Job, but now I began to be afeared\nthat they might light upon us, because uncle breathed so heavily\nthrough's nose.  I put my mouth to his ear and whispered, \"Uncle Job.\"\n\n'\"What is it, my boy?\" he said, just as if he hadn't been asleep at all.\n\n'\"Hush!\" says I.  \"Two French generals--\"\n\n'\"French?\" says he.\n\n'\"Yes,\" says I.  \"Come to see where to land their army!\"\n\n'I pointed 'em out; but I could say no more, for the pair were coming at\nthat moment much nearer to where we lay.  As soon as they got as near as\neight or ten yards, the officer with a roll in his hand stooped down to a\nslanting hurdle, unfastened his roll upon it, and spread it out.  Then\nsuddenly he sprung a dark lantern open on the paper, and showed it to be\na map.\n\n'\"What be they looking at?\" I whispered to Uncle Job.\n\n'\"A chart of the Channel,\" says the sergeant (knowing about such things).\n\n'The other French officer now stooped likewise, and over the map they had\na long consultation, as they pointed here and there on the paper, and\nthen hither and thither at places along the shore beneath us.  I noticed\nthat the manner of one officer was very respectful toward the other, who\nseemed much his superior, the second in rank calling him by a sort of\ntitle that I did not know the sense of.  The head one, on the other hand,\nwas quite familiar with his friend, and more than once clapped him on the\nshoulder.\n\n'Uncle Job had watched as well as I, but though the map had been in the\nlantern-light, their faces had always been in shade.  But when they rose\nfrom stooping over the chart the light flashed upward, and fell smart\nupon one of 'em's features.  No sooner had this happened than Uncle Job\ngasped, and sank down as if he'd been in a fit.\n\n'\"What is it--what is it, Uncle Job?\" said I.\n\n'\"O good God!\" says he, under the straw.\n\n'\"What?\" says I.\n\n'\"Boney!\" he groaned out.\n\n'\"Who?\" says I.\n\n'\"Bonaparty,\" he said.  \"The Corsican ogre.  O that I had got but my new-\nflinted firelock, that there man should die!  But I haven't got my new-\nflinted firelock, and that there man must live.  So lie low, as you value\nyour life!\"\n\n'I did lie low, as you mid suppose.  But I couldn't help peeping.  And\nthen I too, lad as I was, knew that it was the face of Bonaparte.  Not\nknow Boney?  I should think I did know Boney.  I should have known him by\nhalf the light o' that lantern.  If I had seen a picture of his features\nonce, I had seen it a hundred times.  There was his bullet head, his\nshort neck, his round yaller cheeks and chin, his gloomy face, and his\ngreat glowing eyes.  He took off his hat to blow himself a bit, and there\nwas the forelock in the middle of his forehead, as in all the draughts of\nhim.  In moving, his cloak fell a little open, and I could see for a\nmoment his white-fronted jacket and one of his epaulets.\n\n'But none of this lasted long.  In a minute he and his general had rolled\nup the map, shut the lantern, and turned to go down toward the shore.\n\n'Then Uncle Job came to himself a bit.  \"Slipped across in the night-time\nto see how to put his men ashore,\" he said.  \"The like o' that man's\ncoolness eyes will never again see!  Nephew, I must act in this, and\nimmediate, or England's lost!\"\n\n'When they were over the brow, we crope out, and went some little way to\nlook after them.  Half-way down they were joined by two others, and six\nor seven minutes brought them to the shore.  Then, from behind a rock, a\nboat came out into the weak moonlight of the Cove, and they jumped in; it\nput off instantly, and vanished in a few minutes between the two rocks\nthat stand at the mouth of the Cove as we all know.  We climmed back to\nwhere we had been before, and I could see, a little way out, a larger\nvessel, though still not very large.  The little boat drew up alongside,\nwas made fast at the stern as I suppose, for the largest sailed away, and\nwe saw no more.\n\n'My uncle Job told his officers as soon as he got back to camp; but what\nthey thought of it I never heard--neither did he.  Boney's army never\ncame, and a good job for me; for the Cove below my father's house was\nwhere he meant to land, as this secret visit showed.  We coast-folk\nshould have been cut down one and all, and I should not have sat here to\ntell this tale.'\n\nWe who listened to old Selby that night have been familiar with his\nsimple grave-stone for these ten years past.  Thanks to the incredulity\nof the age his tale has been seldom repeated.  But if anything short of\nthe direct testimony of his own eyes could persuade an auditor that\nBonaparte had examined these shores for himself with a view to a\npracticable landing-place, it would have been Solomon Selby's manner of\nnarrating the adventure which befell him on the down.\n\n","\n“LET us hurry to the walls,” said Abel-Phittim to Buzi-Ben-Levi and\nSimeon the Pharisee, on the tenth day of the month Thammuz, in the year\nof the world three thousand nine hundred and forty-one--let us hasten\nto the ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin, which is in the city of\nDavid, and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised; for it is the\nlast hour of the fourth watch, being sunrise; and the idolaters, in\nfulfilment of the promise of Pompey, should be awaiting us with the\nlambs for the sacrifices.”\n\nSimeon, Abel-Phittim, and Duzi-Ben-Levi were the Gizbarim, or\nsub-collectors of the offering, in the holy city of Jerusalem.\n\n“Verily,” replied the Pharisee; “let us hasten: for this generosity\nin the heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an\nattribute of the worshippers of Baal.”\n\n“‘That they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the\nPentateuch,” said Buzi-Ben-Levi, “but that is only toward the people\nof Adonai. When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to\ntheir own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to\nallow us lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof\nthirty silver shekels per head!”\n\n“Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,” replied Abel-Phittim, “that the\nRoman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High,\nhas no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the\naltar, to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.”\n\n“Now, by the five corners of my beard!” shouted the Pharisee, who\nbelonged to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints\nwhose manner of _dashing _and lacerating the feet against the\npavement was long a thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees-a\nstumbling-block to less gifted perambulators)--“by the five corners of\nthat beard which, as a priest, I am forbidden to shave!-have we lived\nto see the day when a blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall\naccuse us of appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy\nand consecrated elements? Have we lived to see the day when--“’\n\n“Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,” interrupted\nAbel-Phittim’ “for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice\nor by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest\nofferings should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of\nheaven can not extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can\nturn aside.”\n\nThat part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and\nwhich bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most\nstrongly fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep\nand lofty hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench,\nhewn from the solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength\nerected upon its inner edge. This wall was adorned, at regular\ninterspaces, by square towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the\nhighest one hundred and twenty cubits in height. But, in the vicinity of\nthe gate of Benjamin, the wall arose by no means from the margin of the\nfosse. On the contrary, between the level of the ditch and the basement\nof the rampart sprang up a perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty\ncubits, forming part of the precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when\nSimeon and his associates arrived on the summit of the tower called\nAdoni-Bezek-the loftiest of all the turrets around about Jerusalem, and\nthe usual place of conference with the besieging army-they looked down\nupon the camp of the enemy from an eminence excelling by many feet that\nof the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by several, that of the temple of Belus.\n\n“Verily,” sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice,\n“the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore-as the locusts\nin the wilderness! The valley of the King hath become the valley of\nAdommin.”\n\n“And yet,” added Ben-Levi, “thou canst not point me out a Philistine-no,\nnot one-from Aleph to Tau-from the wilderness to the battlements--who\nseemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!”\n\n“Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a\nRoman soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the\nregions of Pluto--“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it\nhas broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it thus you evince\nyour gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has\nthought fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? The god Phoebus,\nwho is a true god, has been charioted for an hour-and were you not to\nbe on the ramparts by sunrise? Aedepol! do you think that we, the\nconquerors of the world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by\nthe walls of every kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower\naway! I say--and see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in\nweight!”\n\n“El Elohim!” ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of the\ncenturion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away\nagainst the temple--“El Elohim!--who is the god Phoebus?--whom doth the\nblasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in the laws of\nthe Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the\nTeraphim!--is it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?---or\nAshimah?--or Nibhaz,--or Tartak?--or Adramalech?--or Anamalech?--or\nSuccoth-Benith?--or Dagon?--or Belial?--or Baal-Perith?--or\nBaal-Peor?--or Baal-Zebub?”\n\n“Verily it is neither-but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too\nrapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance to hang\non the projection of Yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of\nthe holy things of the sanctuary.”\n\nBy the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily\nladen basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and,\nfrom the giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen gathering confusedly\nround it; but owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no\ndistinct view of their operations could be obtained.\n\nHalf an hour had already elapsed.\n\n“We shall be too late!” sighed the Pharisee, as at the expiration of\nthis period he looked over into the abyss-“we shall be too late! we\nshall be turned out of office by the Katholim.”\n\n “No more,” responded Abel-Phittim---“no more shall we feast upon the fat\nof the land-no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense--our\nloins girded up with fine linen from the Temple.”\n\n“Racal” swore Ben-Levi, “Racal do they mean to defraud us of the\npurchase money? or, Holy Moses! are they weighing the shekels of the\ntabernacle?”\n\n“They have given the signal at last!” cried the Pharisee-----“they\nhave given the signal at last! pull away, Abel-Phittim!--and thou,\nBuzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!--for verily the Philistines have either still\nhold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts to place\ntherein a beast of good weight!” And the Gizbarim pulled away, while\ntheir burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.\n\n“Booshoh he!”--as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at the\nextremity of the rope became indistinctly visible--“Booshoh he!” was the\nexclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.\n\n*****\n\n“Booshoh he!--for shame!--it is a ram from the thickets of Engedi, and as\nrugged as the valley of jehosaphat!”\n\n“It is a firstling of the flock,” said Abel-Phittim, “I know him by the\nbleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. His eyes\nare more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral, and his flesh is\nlike the honey of Hebron.”\n\n“It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan,” said the Pharisee,\n“the heathen have dealt wonderfully with us----let us raise up\nour voices in a psalm--let us give thanks on the shawm and on the\npsaltery-on the harp and on the huggab-on the cythern and on the\nsackbut!”\n\nIt was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the\nGizbarim that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a hog of no\ncommon size.\n\n“Now El Emanu!” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio, as,\nletting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the\nPhilistines, “El Emanu!-God be with us--it is _the unutterable flesh!”_\n\n","When will you come back to PGP roughly?","Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, and distinguished Members of the House and Senate, honored guests, and fellow citizens:\nLess than 3 weeks ago, I joined you on the West Front of this very building and, looking over the monuments to our proud past, offered you my hand in filling the next page of American history with a story of extended prosperity and continued peace. And tonight I'm back to offer you my plans as well. The hand remains extended; the sleeves are rolled up; America is waiting; and now we must produce. Together, we can build a better America.\nIt is comforting to return to this historic Chamber. Here, 22 years ago, I first raised my hand to be sworn into public life. So, tonight I feel as if I'm returning home to friends. And I intend, in the months and years to come, to give you what friends deserve: frankness, respect, and my best judgment about ways to improve America's future. In return, I ask for an honest commitment to our common mission of progress. If we seize the opportunities on the road before us, there'll be praise enough for all. The people didn't send us here to bicker, and it's time to govern.\nAnd many Presidents have come to this Chamber in times of great crisis: war and depression, loss of national spirit. And 8 years ago, I sat in that very chair as President Reagan spoke of punishing inflation and devastatingly high interest rates and people out of work — American confidence on the wane. And our challenge is different. We're fortunate — a much changed landscape lies before us tonight. So, I don't propose to reverse direction. We're headed the right way, but we cannot rest. We're a people whose energy and drive have fueled our rise to greatness. And we're a forward-looking nation — generous, yes, but ambitious, not for ourselves but for the world. Complacency is not in our character — not before, not now, not ever.\nAnd so, tonight we must take a strong America and make it even better. We must address some very real problems. We must establish some very clear priorities. And we must make a very substantial cut in the Federal budget deficit. Some people find that agenda impossible, but I'm presenting to you tonight a realistic plan for tackling it. My plan has four broad features: attention to urgent priorities, investment in the future, an attack on the deficit, and no new taxes. This budget represents my best judgment of how we can address our priorities. There are many areas in which we would all like to spend more than I propose; I understand that. But we cannot until we get our fiscal house in order.\nNext year alone, thanks to economic growth, without any change in the law, the Federal Government will take in over $80 billion more than it does this year. That's right — over $80 billion in new revenues, with no increases in taxes. And our job is to allocate those new resources wisely. We can afford to increase spending by a modest amount, but enough to invest in key priorities and still cut the deficit by almost 40 percent in 1 year. And that will allow us to meet the targets set forth in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law. But to do that, we must recognize that growth above inflation in Federal programs is not preordained, that not all spending initiatives were designed to be immortal.\nI make this pledge tonight: My team and I are ready to work with the Congress, to form a special leadership group, to negotiate in good faith, to work day and night — if that's what it takes — to meet the budget targets and to produce a budget on time.\nWe cannot settle for business as usual. Government by continuing resolution, or government by crisis, will not do. And I ask the Congress tonight to approve several measures which will make budgeting more sensible. We could save time and improve efficiency by enacting 2-year budgets. Forty-three Governors have the line-item veto. Presidents should have it, too. And at the very least, when a President proposes to rescind Federal spending, the Congress should be required to vote on that proposal instead of killing it by inaction. And I ask the Congress to honor the public's wishes by passing a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. Such an amendment, once phased in, will discipline both the Congress and the executive branch.\nSeveral principles describe the kind of America I hope to build with your help in the years ahead. We will not have the luxury of taking the easy, spendthrift approach to solving problems because higher spending and higher taxes put economic growth at risk. Economic growth provides jobs and hope. Economic growth enables us to pay for social programs. Economic growth enhances the security of the Nation, and low tax rates create economic growth.\nI believe in giving Americans greater freedom and greater choice. And I will work for choice for American families, whether in the housing in which they live, the schools to which they send their children, or the child care they select for their young. You see, I believe that we have an obligation to those in need, but that government should not be the provider of first resort for things that the private sector can produce better. I believe in a society that is free from discrimination and bigotry of any kind. And I will work to knock down the barriers left by past discrimination and to build a more tolerant society that will stop such barriers from ever being built again.\nI believe that family and faith represent the moral compass of the Nation. And I'll work to make them strong, for as Benjamin Franklin said: ``If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, can a great nation rise without His aid? And I believe in giving people the power to make their own lives better through growth and opportunity. And together, let's put power in the hands of people.\nThree weeks ago, we celebrated the bicentennial inaugural, the 200th anniversary of the first Presidency. And if you look back, one thing is so striking about the way the Founding Fathers looked at America. They didn't talk about themselves. They talked about posterity. They talked about the future. And we, too, must think in terms bigger than ourselves. We must take actions today that will ensure a better tomorrow. We must extend American leadership in technology, increase long-term investment, improve our educational system, and boost productivity. These are the keys to building a better future, and here are some of my recommendations:\nI propose almost $2.2 billion for the National Science Foundation to promote basic research and keep us on track to double its budget by 1993.\nI propose to make permanent the tax credit for research and development.\nI've asked Vice President Quayle to chair a new Task Force on Competitiveness.\nAnd I request funding for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and a strong space program, an increase of almost $2.4 billion over the current fiscal year. We must have a manned space station; a vigorous, safe space shuttle program; and more commercial development in space. The space program should always go ``full throttle up. And that's not just our ambition; it's our destiny.\nI propose that we cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains to increase long-term investment. History on this is clear — this will increase revenues, help savings, and create new jobs. We won't be competitive if we leave whole sectors of America behind. This is the year we should finally enact urban enterprise zones and bring hope to the inner cities.\nBut the most important competitiveness program of all is one which improves education in America. When some of our students actually have trouble locating America on a map of the world, it is time for us to map a new approach to education. We must reward excellence and cut through bureaucracy. We must help schools that need help the most. We must give choice to parents, students, teachers, and principals; and we must hold all concerned accountable. In education, we cannot tolerate mediocrity. I want to cut that dropout rate and make America a more literate nation, because what it really comes down to is this: The longer our graduation lines are today, the shorter our unemployment lines will be tomorrow.\nSo, tonight I'm proposing the following initiatives: the beginning of a $500 million program to reward America's best schools, merit schools; the creation of special Presidential awards for the best teachers in every State, because excellence should be rewarded; the establishment of a new program of National Science Scholars, one each year for every Member of the House and Senate, to give this generation of students a special incentive to excel in science and mathematics; the expanded use of magnet schools, which give families and students greater choice; and a new program to encourage alternative certification, which will let talented people from all fields teach in our classrooms. I've said I'd like to be the ``Education President. And tonight, I'd ask you to join me by becoming the ``Education Congress.\nJust last week, as I settled into this new office, I received a letter from a mother in Pennsylvania who had been struck by my message in the Inaugural Address. ``Not 12 hours before, she wrote, ``my husband and I received word that our son was addicted to cocaine. He had the world at his feet. Bright, gifted, personable — he could have done anything with his life. And now he has chosen cocaine. ``And please, she wrote, ``find a way to curb the supply of cocaine. Get tough with the pushers. Our son needs your help.\nMy friends, that voice crying out for help could be the voice of your own neighbor, your own friend, your own son. Over 23 million Americans used illegal drugs last year, at a staggering cost to our nation's well-being. Let this be recorded as the time when America rose up and said no to drugs. The scourge of drugs must be stopped. And I am asking tonight for an increase of almost a billion dollars in budget outlays to escalate the war against drugs. The war must be waged on all fronts. Our new drug czar, Bill Bennett, and I will be shoulder to shoulder in the executive branch leading the charge.\nSome money will be used to expand treatment to the poor and to young mothers. This will offer the helping hand to the many innocent victims of drugs, like the thousands of babies born addicted or with AIDS because of the mother's addiction. Some will be used to cut the waiting time for treatment. Some money will be devoted to those urban schools where the emergency is now the worst. And much of it will be used to protect our borders, with help from the Coast Guard and the Customs Service, the Departments of State and Justice, and, yes, the U.S. military.\nI mean to get tough on the drug criminals. And let me be clear: This President will back up those who put their lives on the line every single day — our local police officers. My budget asks for beefed-up prosecution, for a new attack on organized crime, and for enforcement of tough sentences — and for the worst kingpins, that means the death penalty. I also want to make sure that when a drug dealer is convicted there's a cell waiting for him. And he should not go free because prisons are too full. And so, let the word go out: If you're caught and convicted, you will do time.\nBut for all we do in law enforcement, in interdiction and treatment, we will never win this war on drugs unless we stop the demand for drugs. So, some of this increase will be used to educate the young about the dangers of drugs. We must involve the parents. We must involve the teachers. We must involve the communities. And, my friends, we must involve ourselves, each and every one of us in this concern.\nOne problem related to drug use demands our urgent attention and our continuing compassion, and that is the terrible tragedy of AIDS. I'm asking for $1.6 billion for education to prevent the disease and for research to find a cure.\nIf we're to protect our future, we need a new attitude about the environment. We must protect the air we breathe. I will send to you shortly legislation for a new, more effective Clean Air Act. It will include a plan to reduce by date certain the emissions which cause acid rain, because the time for study alone has passed, and the time for action is now. We must make use of clean coal. My budget contains full funding, on schedule, for the clean coal technology agreement that we've made with Canada. We've made that agreement with Canada, and we intend to honor that agreement. We must not neglect our parks. So, I'm asking to fund new acquisitions under the Land and Water Conservation Fund. We must protect our oceans. And I support new penalties against those who would dump medical waste and other trash into our oceans. The age of the needle on the beaches must end.\nAnd in some cases, the gulfs and oceans off our shores hold the promise of oil and gas reserves which can make our nation more secure and less dependent on foreign oil. And when those with the most promise can be tapped safely, as with much of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, we should proceed. But we must use caution; we must respect the environment. And so, tonight I'm calling for the indefinite postponement of three lease sales which have raised troubling questions, two off the coast of California and one which could threaten the Everglades in Florida. Action on these three lease sales will await the conclusion of a special task force set up to measure the potential for environmental damage.\nI'm directing the Attorney General and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to use every tool at their disposal to speed and toughen the enforcement of our laws against toxic-waste dumpers. I want faster cleanups and tougher enforcement of penalties against polluters.\nIn addition to caring for our future, we must care for those around us. A decent society shows compassion for the young, the elderly, the vulnerable, and the poor. Our first obligation is to the most vulnerable — infants, poor mothers, children living in poverty — and my proposed budget recognizes this. I ask for full funding of Medicaid, an increase of over $3 billion, and an expansion of the program to include coverage of pregnant women who are near the poverty line. I believe we should help working families cope with the burden of child care. Our help should be aimed at those who need it most: low-income families with young children. I support a new child care tax credit that will aim our efforts at exactly those families, without discriminating against mothers who choose to stay at home.\nNow, I know there are competing proposals. But remember this: The overwhelming majority of all preschool child care is now provided by relatives and neighbors and churches and community groups. Families who choose these options should remain eligible for help. Parents should have choice. And for those children who are unwanted or abused or whose parents are deceased, we should encourage adoption. I propose to reenact the tax deduction for adoption expenses and to double it to $3,000. Let's make it easier for these kids to have parents who love them.\nWe have a moral contract with our senior citizens. And in this budget, Social Security is fully funded, including a full cost-of-living adjustment. We must honor our contract.\nWe must care about those in the shadow of life, and I, like many Americans, am deeply troubled by the plight of the homeless. The causes of homelessness are many; the history is long. But the moral imperative to act is clear. Thanks to the deep well of generosity in this great land, many organizations already contribute, but we in government cannot stand on the sidelines. In my budget, I ask for greater support for emergency food and shelter, for health services and measures to prevent substance abuse, and for clinics for the mentally ill. And I propose a new initiative involving the full range of government agencies. We must confront this national shame.\nThere's another issue that I've decided to mention here tonight. I've long believed that the people of Puerto Rico should have the right to determine their own political future. Personally, I strongly favor statehood. But I urge the Congress to take the necessary steps to allow the people to decide in a referendum.\nCertain problems, the result of decades of unwise practices, threaten the health and security of our people. Left unattended, they will only get worse. But we can act now to put them behind us.\nEarlier this week, I announced my support for a plan to restore the financial and moral integrity of our savings system. I ask Congress to enact our reform proposals within 45 days. We must not let this situation fester. We owe it to the savers in this country to solve this problem. Certainly, the savings of Americans must remain secure. Let me be clear: Insured depositors will continue to be fully protected, but any plan to refinance the system must be accompanied by major reform. Our proposals will prevent such a crisis from recurring. The best answer is to make sure that a mess like this will never happen again. The majority of thrifts in communities across the Nation have been honest. They've played a major role in helping families achieve the dream of home ownership. But make no mistake, those who are corrupt, those who break the law, must be kicked out of the business; and they should go to jail.\nWe face a massive task in cleaning up the waste left from decades of environmental neglect at America's nuclear weapons plants. Clearly, we must modernize these plants and operate them safely. That's not at issue; our national security depends on it. But beyond that, we must clean up the old mess that's been left behind. And I propose in this budget to more than double our current effort to do so. This will allow us to identify the exact nature of the various problems so we can clean them up, and clean them up we will.\nWe've been fortunate during these past 8 years. America is a stronger nation than it was in 1980. Morale in our Armed Forces has been restored; our resolve has been shown. Our readiness has been improved, and we are at peace. There can no longer be any doubt that peace has been made more secure through strength. And when America is stronger, the world is safer.\nMost people don't realize that after the successful restoration of our strength, the Pentagon budget has actually been reduced in real terms for each of the last 4 years. We cannot tolerate continued real reduction in defense. In light of the compelling need to reduce the deficit, however, I support a 1-year freeze in the military budget, something I proposed last fall in my flexible freeze plan. And this freeze will apply for only 1 year, and after that, increases above inflation will be required. I will not sacrifice American preparedness, and I will not compromise American strength.\nI should be clear on the conditions attached to my recommendation for the coming year: The savings must be allocated to those priorities for investing in our future that I've spoken about tonight. This defense freeze must be a part of a comprehensive budget agreement which meets the targets spelled out in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law without raising taxes and which incorporates reforms in the budget process.\nI've directed the National Security Council to review our national security and defense policies and report back to me within 90 days to ensure that our capabilities and resources meet our commitments and strategies. I'm also charging the Department of Defense with the task of developing a plan to improve the defense procurement process and management of the Pentagon, one which will fully implement the Packard commission report. Many of these changes can only be made with the participation of the Congress, and so, I ask for your help. We need fewer regulations. We need less bureaucracy. We need multiyear procurement and 2-year budgeting. And frankly — and don't take this wrong — we need less congressional micromanagement of our nation's military policy. I detect a slight division on that question, but nevertheless.\nSecuring a more peaceful world is perhaps the most important priority I'd like to address tonight. You know, we meet at a time of extraordinary hope. Never before in this century have our values of freedom, democracy, and economic opportunity been such a powerful and intellectual force around the globe. Never before has our leadership been so crucial, because while America has its eyes on the future, the world has its eyes on America.\nAnd it's a time of great change in the world, and especially in the Soviet Union. Prudence and common sense dictate that we try to understand the full meaning of the change going on there, review our policies, and then proceed with caution. But I've personally assured General Secretary Gorbachev that at the conclusion of such a review we will be ready to move forward. We will not miss any opportunity to work for peace. The fundamental facts remain that the Soviets retain a very powerful military machine in the service of objectives which are still too often in conflict with ours. So, let us take the new openness seriously, but let's also be realistic. And let's always be strong.\nThere are some pressing issues we must address. I will vigorously pursue the Strategic Defense Initiative. The spread, and even use, of sophisticated weaponry threatens global security as never before. Chemical weapons must be banned from the face of the Earth, never to be used again. And look, this won't be easy. Verification — extraordinarily difficult, but civilization and human decency demand that we try. And the spread of nuclear weapons must be stopped. And I'll work to strengthen the hand of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Our diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\nAnd around the globe, we must continue to be freedom's best friend. And we must stand firm for self-determination and democracy in Central America, including in Nicaragua. It is my strongly held conviction that when people are given the chance they inevitably will choose a free press, freedom of worship, and certifiably free and fair elections.\nWe must strengthen the alliance of the industrial democracies, as solid a force for peace as the world has ever known. And this is an alliance forged by the power of our ideals, not the pettiness of our differences. So, let's lift our sights to rise above fighting about beef hormones, to building a better future, to move from protectionism to progress.\nI've asked the Secretary of State to visit Europe next week and to consult with our allies on the wide range of challenges and opportunities we face together, including East-West relations. And I look forward to meeting with our NATO partners in the near future.\nAnd I, too, shall begin a trip shortly to the far reaches of the Pacific Basin, where the winds of democracy are creating new hope and the power of free markets is unleashing a new force. When I served as our representative in China 14 or 15 years ago, few would have predicted the scope of the changes we've witnessed since then. But in preparing for this trip, I was struck by something I came across from a Chinese writer. He was speaking of his country, decades ago, but his words speak to each of us in America tonight. ``Today, he said, ``we're afraid of the simple words like `goodness' and `mercy' and `kindness.' My friends, if we're to succeed as a nation, we must rediscover those words.\nIn just 3 days, we mark the birthday of Abraham Lincoln, the man who saved our Union and gave new meaning to the word ``opportunity. Lincoln once said: ``I hold that while man exists, it is his duty to improve not only his own condition but to assist in ameliorating that of mankind. It is this broader mission to which I call all Americans, because the definition of a successful life must include serving others.\nAnd to the young people of America, who sometimes feel left out, I ask you tonight to give us the benefit of your talent and energy through a new program called YES, for Youth Entering Service to America.\nTo those men and women in business, remember the ultimate end of your work: to make a better product, to create better lives. I ask you to plan for the longer term and avoid that temptation of quick and easy paper profits.\nTo the brave men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of America, thank you. Your calling is a high one: to be the defenders of freedom and the guarantors of liberty. And I want you to know that this nation is grateful for your service.\nTo the farmers of America, we appreciate the bounty you provide. We will work with you to open foreign markets to American agricultural products.\nAnd to the parents of America, I ask you to get involved in your child's schooling. Check on the homework, go to the school, meet the teachers, care about what is happening there. It's not only your child's future on the line, it's America's.\nTo kids in our cities, don't give up hope. Say no to drugs; stay in school. And, yes, ``Keep hope alive.\nTo those 37 million Americans with some form of disability, you belong in the economic mainstream. We need your talents in America's work force. Disabled Americans must become full partners in America's opportunity society.\nTo the families of America watching tonight in your living rooms, hold fast to your dreams because ultimately America's future rests in your hands.\nAnd to my friends in this Chamber, I ask your cooperation to keep America growing while cutting the deficit. That's only fair to those who now have no vote: the generations to come. Let them look back and say that we had the foresight to understand that a time of peace and prosperity is not the time to rest but a time to press forward, a time to invest in the future.\nAnd let all Americans remember that no problem of human making is too great to be overcome by human ingenuity, human energy, and the untiring hope of the human spirit. I believe this. I would not have asked to be your President if I didn't. And tomorrow the debate on the plan I've put forward begins, and I ask the Congress to come forward with your own proposals. Let's not question each other's motives. Let's debate, let's negotiate; but let us solve the problem.\nRecalling anniversaries may not be my specialty in speeches but tonight is one of some note. On February 9th, 1941, just 48 years ago tonight, Sir Winston Churchill took to the airwaves during Britain's hour of peril. He'd received from President Roosevelt a hand-carried letter quoting Longfellow's famous poem: ``Sail on, O Ship of State! Sail on, O Union, strong and great! Humanity with all its fears, With all the hopes of future years, Is hanging breathless on thy fate! And Churchill responded on this night by radio broadcast to a nation at war, but he directed his words to Franklin Roosevelt. ``We shall not fail or falter, he said. ``We shall not weaken or tire. Give us the tools, and we will finish the job.\nTonight, almost half a century later, our peril may be less immediate, but the need for perseverance and clear-sighted fortitude is just as great. Now, as then, there are those who say it can't be done. There are voices who say that America's best days have passed, that we're bound by constraints, threatened by problems, surrounded by troubles which limit our ability to hope. Well, tonight I remain full of hope. We Americans have only begun on our mission of goodness and greatness. And to those timid souls, I repeat the plea: ``Give us the tools, and we will do the job.\nThank you. God bless you, and God bless America.\n","So long ago, certain place, certain time, you touched my hand.\nAll the way down to Emmiline, but if our paths never cross, well you know I'm sorry but if I live to see the seven wonders, I'll make a path to the rainbow's end.\nI'll never live to match the beauty again, the rainbow's end.\n\nSo it's hard to find someone with that kind of intensity.\nYou touched my hand I played it cool.\n\nSo long ago, it's a certain time, it's a certain place.\nYou touched my hand and you smiled all the way back you held out your hand.\nIf I hope and I pray, ooh it might work out someday.\nIf I live to see the seven wonders, I'll make a path to the rainbow's end.\nI'll never live to match the beauty again.\n\n","“_CON tal que las costumbres de un autor_,” says Don Thomas de las\nTorres, in the preface to his “Amatory Poems” _“sean puras y castas,\nimporto muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras”_--meaning,\nin plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure\npersonally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We\npresume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would\nbe a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him\nthere until his “Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely\nupon the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a\nmoral; and, what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered\nthat every fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a\ncommentary upon the “Batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s\nobject was to excite a distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going\na step farther, shows that the intention was to recommend to young\nmen temperance in eating and drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has\nsatisfied himself that, by Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin;\nby Antinous, Martin Luther; by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general;\nand, by the Harpies, the Dutch. Our more modern Scholiasts are\nequally acute. These fellows demonstrate a hidden meaning in “The\nAntediluvians,” a parable in Powhatan, “new views in Cock Robin,” and\ntranscendentalism in “Hop O’ My Thumb.” In short, it has been shown that\nno man can sit down to write without a very profound design. Thus to\nauthors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for example,\nneed have no care of his moral. It is there--that is to say, it is\nsomewhere--and the moral and the critics can take care of themselves.\nWhen the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended, and all\nthat he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “Dial,” or the\n“Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended, and\nthe rest that he clearly meant to intend:--so that it will all come very\nstraight in the end.\n\nThere is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by\ncertain ignoramuses--that I have never written a moral tale, or, in more\nprecise words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics predestined\nto bring me out, and develop my morals:--that is the secret. By and by\nthe “North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them ashamed of their\nstupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution--by way\nof mitigating the accusations against me--I offer the sad history\nappended,--a history about whose obvious moral there can be no question\nwhatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals which form\nthe title of the tale. I should have credit for this arrangement--a\nfar wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who reserve the\nimpression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus sneak it in at\nthe fag end of their fables.\n\nDefuncti injuria ne afficiantur was a law of the twelve tables, and De\nmortuis nil nisi bonum is an excellent injunction--even if the dead in\nquestion be nothing but dead small beer. It is not my design, therefore,\nto vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad dog, it is\ntrue, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was not to\nblame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his mother.\nShe did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant--for duties\nto her well--regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies, like\ntough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the better\nfor beating--but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be left-handed,\nand a child flogged left-handedly had better be left unflogged. The\nworld revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a baby from\nleft to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an evil\npropensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks\nits quota of wickedness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements,\nand, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was\ngetting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in\nmy eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when\nhe had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might\nhave mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced\nbeyond that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand\nit no longer, but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my\nvoice, made prophecy of his ruin.\n\nThe fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age\nhe used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At\nsix months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he\nwas in the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies.\nAt eight months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the\nTemperance pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after\nmonth, until, at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon\nwearing moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and\nswearing, and for backing his assertions by bets.\n\nThrough this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had\npredicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown\nwith his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when\nhe came to be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without\ninterlarding it with a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid\nwagers--no. I will do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon\nhave laid eggs. With him the thing was a mere formula--nothing more. His\nexpressions on this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They\nwere simple if not altogether innocent expletives--imaginative phrases\nwherewith to round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you so and\nso,” nobody ever thought of taking him up; but still I could not help\nthinking it my duty to put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and\nso I told him. It was a vulgar one--this I begged him to believe. It was\ndiscountenanced by society--here I said nothing but the truth. It was\nforbidden by act of Congress--here I had not the slightest intention\nof telling a lie. I remonstrated--but to no purpose. I demonstrated--in\nvain. I entreated--he smiled. I implored--he laughed. I preached--he\nsneered. I threatened--he swore. I kicked him--he called for the police.\nI pulled his nose--he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil his head\nthat I would not venture to try that experiment again.\n\nPoverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of\nDammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and\nthis was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about\nbetting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that\nI ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “I’ll bet you a\ndollar.” It was usually “I’ll bet you what you please,” or “I’ll bet you\nwhat you dare,” or “I’ll bet you a trifle,” or else, more significantly\nstill, “I’ll bet the Devil my head.”\n\nThis latter form seemed to please him best;--perhaps because it involved\nthe least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious. Had any\none taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have been\nsmall too. But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure\nthat I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the phrase in\nquestion grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of\na man betting his brains like bank-notes:--but this was a point which my\nfriend’s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend.\nIn the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up\nto “I’ll bet the Devil my head,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness\nof devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. I am always\ndispleased by circumstances for which I cannot account. Mysteries\nforce a man to think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there was\nsomething in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to\nhis offensive expression--something in his manner of enunciation--which\nat first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy--something\nwhich, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted\nto call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical,\nMr. Kant pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson\nhyperquizzitistical. I began not to like it at all. Mr. Dammits soul was\nin a perilous state. I resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to\nsave it. I vowed to serve him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is\nsaid to have served the toad,--that is to say, “awaken him to a sense\nof his situation.” I addressed myself to the task forthwith. Once more I\nbetook myself to remonstrance. Again I collected my energies for a final\nattempt at expostulation.\n\nWhen I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit indulged himself in\nsome very equivocal behavior. For some moments he remained silent,\nmerely looking me inquisitively in the face. But presently he threw his\nhead to one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent. Then he\nspread out the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he\nwinked with the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left.\nThen he shut them both up very tight. Then he opened them both so\nvery wide that I became seriously alarmed for the consequences.\nThen, applying his thumb to his nose, he thought proper to make an\nindescribable movement with the rest of his fingers. Finally, setting\nhis arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.\n\nI can call to mind only the beads of his discourse. He would be obliged\nto me if I would hold my tongue. He wished none of my advice. He\ndespised all my insinuations. He was old enough to take care of himself.\nDid I still think him baby Dammit? Did I mean to say any thing against\nhis character? Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool? Was my maternal\nparent aware, in a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence?\nHe would put this latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and\nhe would bind himself to abide by my reply. Once more he would demand\nexplicitly if my mother knew that I was out. My confusion, he said,\nbetrayed me, and he would be willing to bet the Devil his head that she\ndid not.\n\nMr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he\nleft my presence with undignified precipitation. It was well for him\nthat he did so. My feelings had been wounded. Even my anger had been\naroused. For once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. I\nwould have won for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit’s little head--for the fact\nis, my mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from\nhome.\n\nBut Khoda shefa midêhed--Heaven gives relief--as the Mussulmans say when\nyou tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I had\nbeen insulted, and I bore the insult like a man. It now seemed to me,\nhowever, that I had done all that could be required of me, in the case\nof this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no longer\nwith my counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. But\nalthough I forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself\nto give up his society altogether. I even went so far as to humor some\nof his less reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I\nfound myself lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with\ntears in my eyes:--so profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.\n\nOne fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led\nus in the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to\ncross it. It was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and\nthe archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark.\nAs we entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and\nthe interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those\nof the unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was\nhipped. He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively\nlively--so much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy\nsuspicion. It is not impossible that he was affected with the\ntranscendentals. I am not well enough versed, however, in the diagnosis\nof this disease to speak with decision upon the point; and unhappily\nthere were none of my friends of the “Dial” present. I suggest the idea,\nnevertheless, because of a certain species of austere Merry-Andrewism\nwhich seemed to beset my poor friend, and caused him to make quite a\nTom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve him but wriggling and skipping\nabout under and over every thing that came in his way; now shouting\nout, and now lisping out, all manner of odd little and big words, yet\npreserving the gravest face in the world all the time. I really could\nnot make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him. At length, having\npassed nearly across the bridge, we approached the termination of the\nfootway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile of some height.\nThrough this I made my way quietly, pushing it around as usual. But this\nturn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit. He insisted upon leaping\nthe stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the air. Now\nthis, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The best\npigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and as\nI knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done\nby Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a\nbraggadocio, and could not do what he said. For this I had reason to be\nsorry afterward;--for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his head\nthat he could.\n\nI was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some\nremonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a\nslight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ahem!” I\nstarted, and looked about me in surprise. My glance at length fell into\na nook of the frame--work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a little\nlame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing could be more reverend\nthan his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of black,\nbut his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly down\nover a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a girl’s.\nHis hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and his two\neyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.\n\nUpon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk\napron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very\nodd. Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a\ncircumstance, he interrupted me with a second “ahem!”\n\nTo this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply. The fact\nis, remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. I have known\na Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word “Fudge!” I am not ashamed to\nsay, therefore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance.\n\n“Dammit,” said I, “what are you about? don’t you hear?--the gentleman\nsays ‘ahem!’” I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him;\nfor, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is\nparticularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he\nis pretty sure to look like a fool.\n\n“Dammit,” observed I--although this sounded very much like an oath, than\nwhich nothing was further from my thoughts--“Dammit,” I suggested--“the\ngentleman says ‘ahem!’”\n\nI do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did\nnot think it profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our\nspeeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own\neyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb,\nor knocked him in the head with the “Poets and Poetry of America,” he\ncould hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with\nthose simple words: “Dammit, what are you about?--don’t you hear?--the\ngentleman says ‘ahem!’”\n\n“You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning more colors than\na pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. “Are\nyou quite sure he said that? Well, at all events I am in for it now, and\nmay as well put a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then--ahem!”\n\nAt this the little old gentleman seemed pleased--God only knows why.\nHe left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a\ngracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially,\nlooking all the while straight up in his face with an air of the most\nunadulterated benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to\nimagine.\n\n“I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit,” said he, with the frankest of\nall smiles, “but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake\nof mere form.”\n\n“Ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying\na pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable\nalteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down\nthe corners of his mouth--“ahem!” And “ahem!” said he again, after a\npause; and not another word more than “ahem!” did I ever know him to say\nafter that. “Aha!” thought I, without expressing myself aloud--“this is\nquite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt\na consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. One extreme\ninduces another. I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable\nquestions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave\nhim my last lecture? At all events, he is cured of the transcendentals.”\n\n“Ahem!” here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts,\nand looking like a very old sheep in a revery.\n\nThe old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the\nshade of the bridge--a few paces back from the turnstile. “My good\nfellow,” said he, “I make it a point of conscience to allow you this\nmuch run. Wait here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may\nsee whether you go over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t\nomit any flourishes of the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you know. I will\nsay ‘one, two, three, and away.’ Mind you, start at the word ‘away’”\n Here he took his position by the stile, paused a moment as if in\nprofound reflection, then looked up and, I thought, smiled very\nslightly, then tightened the strings of his apron, then took a long look\nat Dammit, and finally gave the word as agreed upon-\n\n            _One--two--three--and--away!_\n\nPunctually at the word “away,” my poor friend set off in a strong\ngallop. The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord’s--nor yet very low,\nlike that of Mr. Lord’s reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure\nthat he would clear it. And then what if he did not?--ah, that was\nthe question--what if he did not? “What right,” said I, “had the\nold gentleman to make any other gentleman jump? The little old\ndot-and-carry-one! who is he? If he asks me to jump, I won’t do it,\nthat’s flat, and I don’t care who the devil he is.” The bridge, as I\nsay, was arched and covered in, in a very ridiculous manner, and there\nwas a most uncomfortable echo about it at all times--an echo which I\nnever before so particularly observed as when I uttered the four last\nwords of my remark.\n\nBut what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an\ninstant. In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had\ntaken the leap. I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor\nof the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he\nwent up. I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration\njust over the top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually\nsingular thing that he did not continue to go over. But the whole leap\nwas the affair of a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any\nprofound reflections, down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back,\non the same side of the stile from which he had started. At the same\ninstant I saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed,\nhaving caught and wrapt up in his apron something that fell heavily into\nit from the darkness of the arch just over the turnstile. At all this\nI was much astonished; but I had no leisure to think, for Dammit lay\nparticularly still, and I concluded that his feelings had been hurt, and\nthat he stood in need of my assistance. I hurried up to him and found\nthat he had received what might be termed a serious injury. The truth\nis, he had been deprived of his head, which after a close search I could\nnot find anywhere; so I determined to take him home and send for the\nhomoeopathists. In the meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open\nan adjacent window of the bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at\nonce. About five feet just above the top of the turnstile, and crossing\nthe arch of the foot-path so as to constitute a brace, there extended a\nflat iron bar, lying with its breadth horizontally, and forming one of\na series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent.\nWith the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my\nunfortunate friend had come precisely in contact.\n\nHe did not long survive his terrible loss. The homoeopathists did not\ngive him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he\nhesitated to take. So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a\nlesson to all riotous livers. I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked\na bar sinister on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses\nof his funeral, sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists.\nThe scoundrels refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once,\nand sold him for dog’s meat.\n\n","Madam Speaker, Vice President Biden, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:\n\nOur Constitution declares that from time to time, the President shall give to Congress information about the state of our union. For 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. They've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility. And they've done so in the midst of war and depression; at moments of great strife and great struggle.\n\nIt's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable -– that America was always destined to succeed. But when the Union was turned back at Bull Run, and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt. When the market crashed on Black Tuesday, and civil rights marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday, the future was anything but certain. These were the times that tested the courage of our convictions, and the strength of our union. And despite all our divisions and disagreements, our hesitations and our fears, America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one nation, as one people.\n\nAgain, we are tested. And again, we must answer history's call.\n\nOne year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt. Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression. So we acted -– immediately and aggressively. And one year later, the worst of the storm has passed.\n\nBut the devastation remains. One in 10 Americans still cannot find work. Many businesses have shuttered. Home values have declined. Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard. And for those who'd already known poverty, life has become that much harder.\n\nThis recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families have been dealing with for decades –- the burden of working harder and longer for less; of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college.\n\nSo I know the anxieties that are out there right now. They're not new. These struggles are the reason I ran for President. These struggles are what I've witnessed for years in places like Elkhart, Indiana; Galesburg, Illinois. I hear about them in the letters that I read each night. The toughest to read are those written by children -– asking why they have to move from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work.\n\nFor these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough. Some are frustrated; some are angry. They don't understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded, but hard work on Main Street isn't; or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems. They're tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness. They know we can't afford it. Not now.\n\nSo we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people hope -– what they deserve -– is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences; to overcome the numbing weight of our politics. For while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same. The aspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills; a chance to get ahead; most of all, the ability to give their children a better life.\n\nYou know what else they share? They share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity. After one of the most difficult years in our history, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids, starting businesses and going back to school. They're coaching Little League and helping their neighbors. One woman wrote to me and said, \"We are strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged.\"\n\nIt's because of this spirit -– this great decency and great strength -– that I have never been more hopeful about America's future than I am tonight. Despite our hardships, our union is strong. We do not give up. We do not quit. We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit. In this new decade, it's time the American people get a government that matches their decency; that embodies their strength. And tonight, tonight I'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.\n\nIt begins with our economy.\n\nOur most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis. It was not easy to do. And if there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout. I hated it -- I hated it. You hated it. It was about as popular as a root canal.\n\nBut when I ran for President, I promised I wouldn't just do what was popular -– I would do what was necessary. And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. More businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would have surely been lost.\n\nSo I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program. And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable. And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks. Most but not all.\n\nTo recover the rest, I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks. Now, I know Wall Street isn't keen on this idea. But if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need.\n\nNow, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans who had become unemployed.\n\nThat's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans; made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRA; and passed 25 different tax cuts.\n\nNow, let me repeat: We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. We cut taxes for small businesses. We cut taxes for first-time homebuyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college.\n\nI thought I'd get some applause on that one.\n\nAs a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. And we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person. Not a single dime.\n\nBecause of the steps we took, there are about two million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed. Two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy; 300,000 are teachers and other education workers. Tens of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, first responders. And we're on track to add another one and a half million jobs to this total by the end of the year.\n\nThe plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the Recovery Act. That's right -– the Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus bill. Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster. But you don't have to take their word for it. Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act. Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created. Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be laid off after all.\n\nThere are stories like this all across America. And after two years of recession, the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly some are starting to hire again.\n\nBut I realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from; who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response. That is why jobs must be our number-one focus in 2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight.\n\nNow, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's businesses. But government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers.\n\nWe should start where most new jobs do –- in small businesses, companies that begin when companies that begin when an entrepreneur -- when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, or a worker decides it's time she became her own boss. Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession and they're ready to grow. But when you talk to small businessowners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger companies. Financing remains difficult for small businessowners across the country, even those that are making a profit.\n\nSo tonight, I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat. I'm also proposing a new small business tax credit -– one that will go to over one million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages. While we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment, and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment.\n\nNext, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow. From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains, or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products.\n\nTomorrow, I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act. There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our nation's goods, services, and information.\n\nWe should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy-efficient, which supports clean energy jobs. And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas, and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America.\n\nNow, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps. As the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same, and I know they will. They will. People are out of work. They're hurting. They need our help. And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay.\n\nBut the truth is, these steps won't make up for the seven million jobs that we've lost over the last two years. The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth, and finally address the problems that America's families have confronted for years.\n\nWe can't afford another so-called economic \"expansion\" like the one from the last decade –- what some call the \"lost decade\" -– where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion; where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs; where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation.\n\nFrom the day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious; such an effort would be too contentious. I've been told that our political system is too gridlocked, and that we should just put things on hold for a while.\n\nFor those who make these claims, I have one simple question: How long should we wait? How long should America put its future on hold?\n\nYou see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse. Meanwhile, China is not waiting to revamp its economy. Germany is not waiting. India is not waiting. These nations -- they're not standing still. These nations aren't playing for second place. They're putting more emphasis on math and science. They're rebuilding their infrastructure. They're making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs. Well, I do not accept second place for the United States of America.\n\nAs hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth.\n\nNow, one place to start is serious financial reform. Look, I am not interested in punishing banks. I'm interested in protecting our economy. A strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes. But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy.\n\nWe need to make sure consumers and middle-class families have the information they need to make financial decisions. We can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy.\n\nNow, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes. And the lobbyists are trying to kill it. But we cannot let them win this fight. And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, I will send it back until we get it right. We've got to get it right.\n\nNext, we need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched. And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy. You can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy -– in the North Carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries; or in the California business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels.\n\nBut to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives. And that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country. It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development. It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies. And, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America.\n\nI am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year. And this year I'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate.\n\nI know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy. I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. But here's the thing -- even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy-efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future -– because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy. And America must be that nation.\n\nThird, we need to export more of our goods. Because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America. So tonight, we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next five years, an increase that will support two million jobs in America. To help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports, and reform export controls consistent with national security.\n\nWe have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are. If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores. But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules. And that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets, and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia.\n\nFourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people.\n\nNow, this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools. And the idea here is simple: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform -- reform that raises student achievement; inspires students to excel in math and science; and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural communities to the inner city. In the 21st century, the best anti-poverty program around is a world-class education. And in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential.\n\nWhen we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states. Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job. That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families.\n\nTo make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans. Instead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for four years of college and increase Pell Grants. And let's tell another one million students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years –- and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.\n\nAnd by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs because they, too, have a responsibility to help solve this problem.\n\nNow, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class. That's why last year I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle-class families. That's why we're nearly doubling the child care tax credit, and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg. That's why we're working to lift the value of a family's single largest investment –- their home. The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments.\n\nThis year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages. And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families that we still need health insurance reform. Yes, we do.\n\nNow, let's clear a few things up. I didn't choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt. And by now it should be fairly obvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good politics. I took on health care because of the stories I've heard from Americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage; patients who've been denied coverage; families –- even those with insurance -– who are just one illness away from financial ruin.\n\nAfter nearly a century of trying -- Democratic administrations, Republican administrations -- we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans. The approach we've taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry. It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market. It would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care.\n\nAnd by the way, I want to acknowledge our First Lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier. Thank you. She gets embarrassed.\n\nOur approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan. It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses. And according to the Congressional Budget Office -– the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress –- our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.\n\nStill, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became. I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people. And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, the process left most Americans wondering, \"What's in it for me?\"\n\nBut I also know this problem is not going away. By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance. Millions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow. Premiums will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. Small business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether. I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this chamber.\n\nSo, as temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the plan we've proposed. There's a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo. But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know. Let me know. Let me know. I'm eager to see it.\n\nHere's what I ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform. Not now. Not when we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people. Let's get it done. Let's get it done.\n\nNow, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. It's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve, and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing. So let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight.\n\nAt the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion. By the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program. On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget. All this was before I walked in the door.\n\nNow -- just stating the facts. Now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit. But we took office amid a crisis. And our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt. That, too, is a fact.\n\nI'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do. But families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal government should do the same. So tonight, I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year.\n\nStarting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years. Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will not be affected. But all other discretionary government programs will. Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't. And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will.\n\nWe will continue to go through the budget, line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work. We've already identified $20 billion in savings for next year. To help working families, we'll extend our middle-class tax cuts. But at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year. We just can't afford it.\n\nNow, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit we had when I took office. More importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to skyrocket. That's why I've called for a bipartisan fiscal commission, modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad. This can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solved a problem. The commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline.\n\nNow, yesterday, the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission. So I'll issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans. And when the vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.\n\nNow, I know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting. And I agree -- which is why this freeze won't take effect until next year when the economy is stronger. That's how budgeting works. But understand –- understand if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery -– all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes.\n\nFrom some on the right, I expect we'll hear a different argument -– that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts including those for the wealthier Americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away. The problem is that's what we did for eight years. That's what helped us into this crisis. It's what helped lead to these deficits. We can't do it again.\n\nRather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades, it's time to try something new. Let's invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt. Let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here. Let's try common sense. A novel concept.\n\nTo do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now. We face a deficit of trust -– deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years. To close that credibility gap we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue -- to end the outsized influence of lobbyists; to do our work openly; to give our people the government they deserve.\n\nThat's what I came to Washington to do. That's why -– for the first time in history –- my administration posts on our White House visitors online. That's why we've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs, or seats on federal boards and commissions.\n\nBut we can't stop there. It's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or with Congress. It's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office.\n\nWith all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests –- including foreign corporations –- to spend without limit in our elections. I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people. And I'd urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to correct some of these problems.\n\nI'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform. Democrats and Republicans. Democrats and Republicans. You've trimmed some of this spending, you've embraced some meaningful change. But restoring the public trust demands more. For example, some members of Congress post some earmark requests online. Tonight, I'm calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single Web site before there's a vote, so that the American people can see how their money is being spent.\n\nOf course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how we work with one another. Now, I'm not naïve. I never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony and some post-partisan era. I knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched. And on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. These disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, they've been taking place for over 200 years. They're the very essence of our democracy.\n\nBut what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day. We can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side -– a belief that if you lose, I win. Neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can. The confirmation of I'm speaking to both parties now. The confirmation of well-qualified public servants shouldn't be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual senators.\n\nWashington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game. But it's precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the American people. Worse yet, it's sowing further division among our citizens, further distrust in our government.\n\nSo, no, I will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics. I know it's an election year. And after last week, it's clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual. But we still need to govern.\n\nTo Democrats, I would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills. And if the Republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this town -- a supermajority -- then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well. Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it's not leadership. We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions. So let's show the American people that we can do it together.\n\nThis week, I'll be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans. I'd like to begin monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership. I know you can't wait.\n\nThroughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our security. Sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated. We can argue all we want about who's to blame for this, but I'm not interested in re-litigating the past. I know that all of us love this country. All of us are committed to its defense. So let's put aside the schoolyard taunts about who's tough. Let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values. Let's leave behind the fear and division, and do what it takes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future -- for America and for the world.\n\nThat's the work we began last year. Since the day I took office, we've renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation. We've made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take American lives. We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack, with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence. We've prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula. And in the last year, hundreds of al Qaeda's fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed -- far more than in 2008.\n\nAnd in Afghanistan, we're increasing our troops and training Afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011, and our troops can begin to come home. We will reward good governance, work to reduce corruption, and support the rights of all Afghans -- men and women alike. We're joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitments, and who will come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose. There will be difficult days ahead. But I am absolutely confident we will succeed.\n\nAs we take the fight to al Qaeda, we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its people. As a candidate, I promised that I would end this war, and that is what I am doing as President. We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August. We will support the Iraqi government -- we will support the Iraqi government as they hold elections, and we will continue to partner with the Iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity. But make no mistake: This war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home.\n\nTonight, all of our men and women in uniform -- in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and around the world –- they have to know that we -- that they have our respect, our gratitude, our full support. And just as they must have the resources they need in war, we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home. That's why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades -- last year. That's why we're building a 21st century VA. And that's why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families.\n\nNow, even as we prosecute two wars, we're also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the American people -– the threat of nuclear weapons. I've embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them. To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest-reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades. And at April's Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington, D.C. behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years, so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists.\n\nNow, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons. That's why North Korea now faces increased isolation, and stronger sanctions –- sanctions that are being vigorously enforced. That's why the international community is more united, and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated. And as Iran's leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt: They, too, will face growing consequences. That is a promise.\n\nThat's the leadership that we are providing –- engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people. We're working through the G20 to sustain a lasting global recovery. We're working with Muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation. We have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change. We're helping developing countries to feed themselves, and continuing the fight against HIV/AIDS. And we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease -– a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad.\n\nAs we have for over 60 years, America takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores. But we also do it because it is right. That's why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 Americans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild. That's why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan; why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran; why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in Guinea. For America must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity. Always.\n\nAbroad, America's greatest source of strength has always been our ideals. The same is true at home. We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution: the notion that we're all created equal; that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the law you should be protected by it; if you adhere to our common values you should be treated no different than anyone else.\n\nWe must continually renew this promise. My administration has a Civil Rights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination. We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate. This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are. It's the right thing to do.\n\nWe're going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws -– so that women get equal pay for an equal day's work. And we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system -– to secure our borders and enforce our laws, and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation.\n\nIn the end, it's our ideals, our values that built America -- values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe; values that drive our citizens still. Every day, Americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers. Time and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country. They take pride in their labor, and are generous in spirit. These aren't Republican values or Democratic values that they're living by; business values or labor values. They're American values.\n\nUnfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions -– our corporations, our media, and, yes, our government –- still reflect these same values. Each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper. But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure, or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people's doubts grow. Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up, we lose faith. The more that TV pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments, big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away.\n\nNo wonder there's so much cynicism out there. No wonder there's so much disappointment.\n\nI campaigned on the promise of change –- change we can believe in, the slogan went. And right now, I know there are many Americans who aren't sure if they still believe we can change –- or that I can deliver it.\n\nBut remember this –- I never suggested that change would be easy, or that I could do it alone. Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated. And when you try to do big things and make big changes, it stirs passions and controversy. That's just how it is.\n\nThose of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers. We can do what's necessary to keep our poll numbers high, and get through the next election instead of doing what's best for the next generation.\n\nBut I also know this: If people had made that decision 50 years ago, or 100 years ago, or 200 years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight. The only reason we are here is because generations of Americans were unafraid to do what was hard; to do what was needed even when success was uncertain; to do what it took to keep the dream of this nation alive for their children and their grandchildren.\n\nOur administration has had some political setbacks this year, and some of them were deserved. But I wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year. And what keeps me going -– what keeps me fighting -– is that despite all these setbacks, that spirit of determination and optimism, that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the American people, that lives on.\n\nIt lives on in the struggling small business owner who wrote to me of his company, \"None of us,\" he said, \"…are willing to consider, even slightly, that we might fail.\"\n\nIt lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession, \"We are strong. We are resilient. We are American.\"\n\nIt lives on in the 8-year-old boy in Louisiana, who just sent me his allowance and asked if I would give it to the people of Haiti.\n\nAnd it lives on in all the Americans who've dropped everything to go someplace they've never been and pull people they've never known from the rubble, prompting chants of \"U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A!\" when another life was saved.\n\nThe spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you, its people. We have finished a difficult year. We have come through a difficult decade. But a new year has come. A new decade stretches before us. We don't quit. I don't quit. Let's seize this moment -- to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more.\n\nThank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.\n","\nIt is a Saturday afternoon of blue and yellow autumn time, and the scene\nis the High Street of a well-known market-town.  A large carrier's van\nstands in the quadrangular fore-court of the White Hart Inn, upon the\nsides of its spacious tilt being painted, in weather-beaten letters:\n'Burthen, Carrier to Longpuddle.'  These vans, so numerous hereabout, are\na respectable, if somewhat lumbering, class of conveyance, much resorted\nto by decent travellers not overstocked with money, the better among them\nroughly corresponding to the old French _diligences_.\n\nThe present one is timed to leave the town at four in the afternoon\nprecisely, and it is now half-past three by the clock in the turret at\nthe top of the street.  In a few seconds errand-boys from the shops begin\nto arrive with packages, which they fling into the vehicle, and turn away\nwhistling, and care for the packages no more.  At twenty minutes to four\nan elderly woman places her basket upon the shafts, slowly mounts, takes\nup a seat inside, and folds her hands and her lips.  She has secured her\ncorner for the journey, though there is as yet no sign of a horse being\nput in, nor of a carrier.  At the three-quarters, two other women arrive,\nin whom the first recognizes the postmistress of Upper Longpuddle and the\nregistrar's wife, they recognizing her as the aged groceress of the same\nvillage.  At five minutes to the hour there approach Mr. Profitt, the\nschoolmaster, in a soft felt hat, and Christopher Twink, the\nmaster-thatcher; and as the hour strikes there rapidly drop in the parish\nclerk and his wife, the seedsman and his aged father, the registrar; also\nMr. Day, the world-ignored local landscape-painter, an elderly man who\nresides in his native place, and has never sold a picture outside it,\nthough his pretensions to art have been nobly supported by his fellow-\nvillagers, whose confidence in his genius has been as remarkable as the\nouter neglect of it, leading them to buy his paintings so extensively (at\nthe price of a few shillings each, it is true) that every dwelling in the\nparish exhibits three or four of those admired productions on its walls.\n\nBurthen, the carrier, is by this time seen bustling round the vehicle;\nthe horses are put in, the proprietor arranges the reins and springs up\ninto his seat as if he were used to it--which he is.\n\n'Is everybody here?' he asks preparatorily over his shoulder to the\npassengers within.\n\nAs those who were not there did not reply in the negative the muster was\nassumed to be complete, and after a few hitches and hindrances the van\nwith its human freight was got under way.  It jogged on at an easy pace\ntill it reached the bridge which formed the last outpost of the town.  The\ncarrier pulled up suddenly.\n\n'Bless my soul!' he said, 'I've forgot the curate!'\n\nAll who could do so gazed from the little back window of the van, but the\ncurate was not in sight.\n\n'Now I wonder where that there man is?' continued the carrier.\n\n'Poor man, he ought to have a living at his time of life.'\n\n'And he ought to be punctual,' said the carrier.  '\"Four o'clock sharp is\nmy time for starting,\" I said to 'en.  And he said, \"I'll be there.\"  Now\nhe's not here, and as a serious old church-minister he ought to be as\ngood as his word.  Perhaps Mr. Flaxton knows, being in the same line of\nlife?'  He turned to the parish clerk.\n\n'I was talking an immense deal with him, that's true, half an hour ago,'\nreplied that ecclesiastic, as one of whom it was no erroneous supposition\nthat he should be on intimate terms with another of the cloth.  'But he\ndidn't say he would be late.'\n\nThe discussion was cut off by the appearance round the corner of the van\nof rays from the curate's spectacles, followed hastily by his face and a\nfew white whiskers, and the swinging tails of his long gaunt coat.  Nobody\nreproached him, seeing how he was reproaching himself; and he entered\nbreathlessly and took his seat.\n\n'Now be we all here?' said the carrier again.  They started a second\ntime, and moved on till they were about three hundred yards out of the\ntown, and had nearly reached the second bridge, behind which, as every\nnative remembers, the road takes a turn and travellers by this highway\ndisappear finally from the view of gazing burghers.\n\n'Well, as I'm alive!' cried the postmistress from the interior of the\nconveyance, peering through the little square back-window along the road\ntownward.\n\n'What?' said the carrier.\n\n'A man hailing us!'\n\nAnother sudden stoppage.  'Somebody else?' the carrier asked.\n\n'Ay, sure!'  All waited silently, while those who could gaze out did so.\n\n'Now, who can that be?' Burthen continued.  'I just put it to ye,\nneighbours, can any man keep time with such hindrances?  Bain't we full\na'ready?  Who in the world can the man be?'\n\n'He's a sort of gentleman,' said the schoolmaster, his position\ncommanding the road more comfortably than that of his comrades.\n\nThe stranger, who had been holding up his umbrella to attract their\nnotice, was walking forward leisurely enough, now that he found, by their\nstopping, that it had been secured.  His clothes were decidedly not of a\nlocal cut, though it was difficult to point out any particular mark of\ndifference.  In his left hand he carried a small leather travelling bag.\nAs soon as he had overtaken the van he glanced at the inscription on its\nside, as if to assure himself that he had hailed the right conveyance,\nand asked if they had room.\n\nThe carrier replied that though they were pretty well laden he supposed\nthey could carry one more, whereupon the stranger mounted, and took the\nseat cleared for him within.  And then the horses made another move, this\ntime for good, and swung along with their burden of fourteen souls all\ntold.\n\n'You bain't one of these parts, sir?' said the carrier.  'I could tell\nthat as far as I could see 'ee.'\n\n'Yes, I am one of these parts,' said the stranger.\n\n'Oh?  H'm.'\n\nThe silence which followed seemed to imply a doubt of the truth of the\nnew-comer's assertion.  'I was speaking of Upper Longpuddle more\nparticular,' continued the carrier hardily, 'and I think I know most\nfaces of that valley.'\n\n'I was born at Longpuddle, and nursed at Longpuddle, and my father and\ngrandfather before me,' said the passenger quietly.\n\n'Why, to be sure,' said the aged groceress in the background, 'it isn't\nJohn Lackland's son--never--it can't be--he who went to foreign parts\nfive-and-thirty years ago with his wife and family?  Yet--what do I\nhear?--that's his father's voice!'\n\n'That's the man,' replied the stranger.  'John Lackland was my father,\nand I am John Lackland's son.  Five-and-thirty years ago, when I was a\nboy of eleven, my parents emigrated across the seas, taking me and my\nsister with them.  Kytes's boy Tony was the one who drove us and our\nbelongings to Casterbridge on the morning we left; and his was the last\nLongpuddle face I saw.  We sailed the same week across the ocean, and\nthere we've been ever since, and there I've left those I went with--all\nthree.'\n\n'Alive or dead?'\n\n'Dead,' he replied in a low voice.  'And I have come back to the old\nplace, having nourished a thought--not a definite intention, but just a\nthought--that I should like to return here in a year or two, to spend the\nremainder of my days.'\n\n'Married man, Mr. Lackland?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'And have the world used 'ee well, sir--or rather John, knowing 'ee as a\nchild?  In these rich new countries that we hear of so much, you've got\nrich with the rest?'\n\n'I am not very rich,' Mr. Lackland said.  'Even in new countries, you\nknow, there are failures.  The race is not always to the swift, nor the\nbattle to the strong; and even if it sometimes is, you may be neither\nswift nor strong.  However, that's enough about me.  Now, having answered\nyour inquiries, you must answer mine; for being in London, I have come\ndown here entirely to discover what Longpuddle is looking like, and who\nare living there.  That was why I preferred a seat in your van to hiring\na carriage for driving across.'\n\n'Well, as for Longpuddle, we rub on there much as usual.  Old figures\nhave dropped out o' their frames, so to speak it, and new ones have been\nput in their places.  You mentioned Tony Kytes as having been the one to\ndrive your family and your goods to Casterbridge in his father's waggon\nwhen you left.  Tony is, I believe, living still, but not at Longpuddle.\nHe went away and settled at Lewgate, near Mellstock, after his marriage.\nAh, Tony was a sort o' man!'\n\n'His character had hardly come out when I knew him.'\n\n'No.  But 'twas well enough, as far as that goes--except as to women.  I\nshall never forget his courting--never!'\n\nThe returned villager waited silently, and the carrier went on:--\n\n","\n\n'One day,' the registrar continued, 'Georgy was ambling out of Melchester\non a miserable screw, the fair being just over, when he saw in front of\nhim a fine-looking young farmer riding out of the town in the same\ndirection.  He was mounted on a good strong handsome animal, worth fifty\nguineas if worth a crown.  When they were going up Bissett Hill, Georgy\nmade it his business to overtake the young farmer.  They passed the time\no' day to one another; Georgy spoke of the state of the roads, and jogged\nalongside the well-mounted stranger in very friendly conversation.  The\nfarmer had not been inclined to say much to Georgy at first, but by\ndegrees he grew quite affable too--as friendly as Georgy was toward him.\nHe told Crookhill that he had been doing business at Melchester fair, and\nwas going on as far as Shottsford-Forum that night, so as to reach\nCasterbridge market the next day.  When they came to Woodyates Inn they\nstopped to bait their horses, and agreed to drink together; with this\nthey got more friendly than ever, and on they went again.  Before they\nhad nearly reached Shottsford it came on to rain, and as they were now\npassing through the village of Trantridge, and it was quite dark, Georgy\npersuaded the young farmer to go no further that night; the rain would\nmost likely give them a chill.  For his part he had heard that the little\ninn here was comfortable, and he meant to stay.  At last the young farmer\nagreed to put up there also; and they dismounted, and entered, and had a\ngood supper together, and talked over their affairs like men who had\nknown and proved each other a long time.  When it was the hour for\nretiring they went upstairs to a double-bedded room which Georgy\nCrookhill had asked the landlord to let them share, so sociable were\nthey.\n\n'Before they fell asleep they talked across the room about one thing and\nanother, running from this to that till the conversation turned upon\ndisguises, and changing clothes for particular ends.  The farmer told\nGeorgy that he had often heard tales of people doing it; but Crookhill\nprofessed to be very ignorant of all such tricks; and soon the young\nfarmer sank into slumber.\n\n'Early in the morning, while the tall young farmer was still asleep (I\ntell the story as 'twas told me), honest Georgy crept out of his bed by\nstealth, and dressed himself in the farmer's clothes, in the pockets of\nthe said clothes being the farmer's money.  Now though Georgy\nparticularly wanted the farmer's nice clothes and nice horse, owing to a\nlittle transaction at the fair which made it desirable that he should not\nbe too easily recognized, his desires had their bounds: he did not wish\nto take his young friend's money, at any rate more of it than was\nnecessary for paying his bill.  This he abstracted, and leaving the\nfarmer's purse containing the rest on the bedroom table, went downstairs.\nThe inn folks had not particularly noticed the faces of their customers,\nand the one or two who were up at this hour had no thought but that\nGeorgy was the farmer; so when he had paid the bill very liberally, and\nsaid he must be off, no objection was made to his getting the farmer's\nhorse saddled for himself; and he rode away upon it as if it were his\nown.\n\n'About half an hour after the young farmer awoke, and looking across the\nroom saw that his friend Georgy had gone away in clothes which didn't\nbelong to him, and had kindly left for himself the seedy ones worn by\nGeorgy.  At this he sat up in a deep thought for some time, instead of\nhastening to give an alarm.  \"The money, the money is gone,\" he said to\nhimself, \"and that's bad.  But so are the clothes.\"\n\n'He then looked upon the table and saw that the money, or most of it, had\nbeen left behind.\n\n'\"Ha, ha, ha!\" he cried, and began to dance about the room.  \"Ha, ha,\nha!\" he said again, and made beautiful smiles to himself in the shaving\nglass and in the brass candlestick; and then swung about his arms for all\nthe world as if he were going through the sword exercise.\n\n'When he had dressed himself in Georgy's clothes and gone downstairs, he\ndid not seem to mind at all that they took him for the other; and even\nwhen he saw that he had been left a bad horse for a good one, he was not\ninclined to cry out.  They told him his friend had paid the bill, at\nwhich he seemed much pleased, and without waiting for breakfast he\nmounted Georgy's horse and rode away likewise, choosing the nearest by-\nlane in preference to the high-road, without knowing that Georgy had\nchosen that by-lane also.\n\n'He had not trotted more than two miles in the personal character of\nGeorgy Crookhill when, suddenly rounding a bend that the lane made\nthereabout, he came upon a man struggling in the hands of two village\nconstables.  It was his friend Georgy, the borrower of his clothes and\nhorse.  But so far was the young farmer from showing any alacrity in\nrushing forward to claim his property that he would have turned the poor\nbeast he rode into the wood adjoining, if he had not been already\nperceived.\n\n'\"Help, help, help!\" cried the constables.  \"Assistance in the name of\nthe Crown!\"\n\n'The young farmer could do nothing but ride forward.  \"What's the\nmatter?\" he inquired, as coolly as he could.\n\n'\"A deserter--a deserter!\" said they.  \"One who's to be tried by court-\nmartial and shot without parley.  He deserted from the Dragoons at\nCheltenham some days ago, and was tracked; but the search-party can't\nfind him anywhere, and we told 'em if we met him we'd hand him on to 'em\nforthwith.  The day after he left the barracks the rascal met a\nrespectable farmer and made him drunk at an inn, and told him what a fine\nsoldier he would make, and coaxed him to change clothes, to see how well\na military uniform would become him.  This the simple farmer did; when\nour deserter said that for a joke he would leave the room and go to the\nlandlady, to see if she would know him in that dress.  He never came\nback, and Farmer Jollice found himself in soldier's clothes, the money in\nhis pockets gone, and, when he got to the stable, his horse gone too.\"\n\n'\"A scoundrel!\" says the young man in Georgy's clothes.  \"And is this the\nwretched caitiff?\" (pointing to Georgy).\n\n'\"No, no!\" cries Georgy, as innocent as a babe of this matter of the\nsoldier's desertion.  \"He's the man!  He was wearing Farmer Jollice's\nsuit o' clothes, and he slept in the same room wi' me, and brought up the\nsubject of changing clothes, which put it into my head to dress myself in\nhis suit before he was awake.  He's got on mine!\"\n\n'\"D'ye hear the villain?\" groans the tall young man to the constables.\n\"Trying to get out of his crime by charging the first innocent man with\nit that he sees!  No, master soldier--that won't do!\"\n\n'\"No, no!  That won't do!\" the constables chimed in.  \"To have the\nimpudence to say such as that, when we caught him in the act almost!  But,\nthank God, we've got the handcuffs on him at last.\"\n\n'\"We have, thank God,\" said the tall young man.  \"Well, I must move on.\nGood luck to ye with your prisoner!\"  And off he went, as fast as his\npoor jade would carry him.\n\n'The constables then, with Georgy handcuffed between 'em, and leading the\nhorse, marched off in the other direction, toward the village where they\nhad been accosted by the escort of soldiers sent to bring the deserter\nback, Georgy groaning: \"I shall be shot, I shall be shot!\"  They had not\ngone more than a mile before they met them.\n\n'\"Hoi, there!\" says the head constable.\n\n'\"Hoi, yerself!\" says the corporal in charge.\n\n'\"We've got your man,\" says the constable.\n\n'\"Where?\" says the corporal.\n\n'\"Here, between us,\" said the constable.  \"Only you don't recognize him\nout o' uniform.\"\n\n'The corporal looked at Georgy hard enough; then shook his head and said\nhe was not the absconder.\n\n'\"But the absconder changed clothes with Farmer Jollice, and took his\nhorse; and this man has 'em, d'ye see!\"\n\n'\"'Tis not our man,\" said the soldiers.  \"He's a tall young fellow with a\nmole on his right cheek, and a military bearing, which this man decidedly\nhas not.\"\n\n'\"I told the two officers of justice that 'twas the other!\" pleaded\nGeorgy.  \"But they wouldn't believe me.\"\n\n'And so it became clear that the missing dragoon was the tall young\nfarmer, and not Georgy Crookhill--a fact which Farmer Jollice himself\ncorroborated when he arrived on the scene.  As Georgy had only robbed the\nrobber, his sentence was comparatively light.  The deserter from the\nDragoons was never traced: his double shift of clothing having been of\nthe greatest advantage to him in getting off; though he left Georgy's\nhorse behind him a few miles ahead, having found the poor creature more\nhindrance than aid.'\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe man from abroad seemed to be less interested in the questionable\ncharacters of Longpuddle and their strange adventures than in the\nordinary inhabitants and the ordinary events, though his local fellow-\ntravellers preferred the former as subjects of discussion.  He now for\nthe first time asked concerning young persons of the opposite sex--or\nrather those who had been young when he left his native land.  His\ninformants, adhering to their own opinion that the remarkable was better\nworth telling than the ordinary, would not allow him to dwell upon the\nsimple chronicles of those who had merely come and gone.  They asked him\nif he remembered Netty Sargent.\n\n'Netty Sargent--I do, just remember her.  She was a young woman living\nwith her uncle when I left, if my childish recollection may be trusted.'\n\n'That was the maid.  She was a oneyer, if you like, sir.  Not any harm in\nher, you know, but up to everything.  You ought to hear how she got the\ncopyhold of her house extended.  Oughtn't he, Mr. Day?'\n\n'He ought,' replied the world-ignored old painter.\n\n'Tell him, Mr. Day.  Nobody can do it better than you, and you know the\nlegal part better than some of us.'\n\nDay apologized, and began:--\n\n\n\nNETTY SARGENT'S COPYHOLD\n\n\n'She continued to live with her uncle, in the lonely house by the copse,\njust as at the time you knew her; a tall spry young woman.  Ah, how well\none can remember her black hair and dancing eyes at that time, and her\nsly way of screwing up her mouth when she meant to tease ye!  Well, she\nwas hardly out of short frocks before the chaps were after her, and by\nlong and by late she was courted by a young man whom perhaps you did not\nknow--Jasper Cliff was his name--and, though she might have had many a\nbetter fellow, he so greatly took her fancy that 'twas Jasper or nobody\nfor her.  He was a selfish customer, always thinking less of what he was\ngoing to do than of what he was going to gain by his doings.  Jasper's\neyes might have been fixed upon Netty, but his mind was upon her uncle's\nhouse; though he was fond of her in his way--I admit that.\n\n'This house, built by her great-great-grandfather, with its garden and\nlittle field, was copyhold--granted upon lives in the old way, and had\nbeen so granted for generations.  Her uncle's was the last life upon the\nproperty; so that at his death, if there was no admittance of new lives,\nit would all fall into the hands of the lord of the manor.  But 'twas\neasy to admit--a slight \"fine,\" as 'twas called, of a few pounds, was\nenough to entitle him to a new deed o' grant by the custom of the manor;\nand the lord could not hinder it.\n\n'Now there could be no better provision for his niece and only relative\nthan a sure house over her head, and Netty's uncle should have seen to\nthe renewal in time, owing to the peculiar custom of forfeiture by the\ndropping of the last life before the new fine was paid; for the Squire\nwas very anxious to get hold of the house and land; and every Sunday when\nthe old man came into the church and passed the Squire's pew, the Squire\nwould say, \"A little weaker in his knees, a little crookeder in his\nback--and the readmittance not applied for: ha! ha!  I shall be able to\nmake a complete clearing of that corner of the manor some day!\"\n\n''Twas extraordinary, now we look back upon it, that old Sargent should\nhave been so dilatory; yet some people are like it; and he put off\ncalling at the Squire's agent's office with the fine week after week,\nsaying to himself, \"I shall have more time next market-day than I have\nnow.\"  One unfortunate hindrance was that he didn't very well like Jasper\nCliff; and as Jasper kept urging Netty, and Netty on that account kept\nurging her uncle, the old man was inclined to postpone the re-liveing as\nlong as he could, to spite the selfish young lover.  At last old Mr.\nSargent fell ill, and then Jasper could bear it no longer: he produced\nthe fine-money himself, and handed it to Netty, and spoke to her plainly.\n\n'\"You and your uncle ought to know better.  You should press him more.\nThere's the money.  If you let the house and ground slip between ye, I\nwon't marry; hang me if I will!  For folks won't deserve a husband that\ncan do such things.\"\n\n'The worried girl took the money and went home, and told her uncle that\nit was no house no husband for her.  Old Mr. Sargent pooh-poohed the\nmoney, for the amount was not worth consideration, but he did now bestir\nhimself; for he saw she was bent upon marrying Jasper, and he did not\nwish to make her unhappy, since she was so determined.  It was much to\nthe Squire's annoyance that he found Sargent had moved in the matter at\nlast; but he could not gainsay it, and the documents were prepared (for\non this manor the copy-holders had writings with their holdings, though\non some manors they had none).  Old Sargent being now too feeble to go to\nthe agent's house, the deed was to be brought to his house signed, and\nhanded over as a receipt for the money; the counterpart to be signed by\nSargent, and sent back to the Squire.\n\n'The agent had promised to call on old Sargent for this purpose at five\no'clock, and Netty put the money into her desk to have it close at hand.\nWhile doing this she heard a slight cry from her uncle, and turning\nround, saw that he had fallen forward in his chair.  She went and lifted\nhim, but he was unconscious; and unconscious he remained.  Neither\nmedicine nor stimulants would bring him to himself.  She had been told\nthat he might possibly go off in that way, and it seemed as if the end\nhad come.  Before she had started for a doctor his face and extremities\ngrew quite cold and white, and she saw that help would be useless.  He\nwas stone-dead.\n\n'Netty's situation rose upon her distracted mind in all its seriousness.\nThe house, garden, and field were lost--by a few hours--and with them a\nhome for herself and her lover.  She would not think so meanly of Jasper\nas to suppose that he would adhere to the resolution declared in a moment\nof impatience; but she trembled, nevertheless.  Why could not her uncle\nhave lived a couple of hours longer, since he had lived so long?  It was\nnow past three o'clock; at five the agent was to call, and, if all had\ngone well, by ten minutes past five the house and holding would have been\nsecurely hers for her own and Jasper's lives, these being two of the\nthree proposed to be added by paying the fine.  How that wretched old\nSquire would rejoice at getting the little tenancy into his hands!  He\ndid not really require it, but constitutionally hated these tiny\ncopyholds and leaseholds and freeholds, which made islands of\nindependence in the fair, smooth ocean of his estates.\n\n'Then an idea struck into the head of Netty how to accomplish her object\nin spite of her uncle's negligence.  It was a dull December afternoon:\nand the first step in her scheme--so the story goes, and I see no reason\nto doubt it--'\n\n''Tis true as the light,' affirmed Christopher Twink.  'I was just\npassing by.'\n\n'The first step in her scheme was to fasten the outer door, to make sure\nof not being interrupted.  Then she set to work by placing her uncle's\nsmall, heavy oak table before the fire; then she went to her uncle's\ncorpse, sitting in the chair as he had died--a stuffed arm-chair, on\ncasters, and rather high in the seat, so it was told me--and wheeled the\nchair, uncle and all, to the table, placing him with his back toward the\nwindow, in the attitude of bending over the said oak table, which I knew\nas a boy as well as I know any piece of furniture in my own house.  On\nthe table she laid the large family Bible open before him, and placed his\nforefinger on the page; and then she opened his eyelids a bit, and put on\nhim his spectacles, so that from behind he appeared for all the world as\nif he were reading the Scriptures.  Then she unfastened the door and sat\ndown, and when it grew dark she lit a candle, and put it on the table\nbeside her uncle's book.\n\n'Folk may well guess how the time passed with her till the agent came,\nand how, when his knock sounded upon the door, she nearly started out of\nher skin--at least that's as it was told me.  Netty promptly went to the\ndoor.\n\n'\"I am sorry, sir,\" she says, under her breath; \"my uncle is not so well\nto-night, and I'm afraid he can't see you.\"\n\n'\"H'm!--that's a pretty tale,\" says the steward.  \"So I've come all this\nway about this trumpery little job for nothing!\"\n\n'\"O no, sir--I hope not,\" says Netty.  \"I suppose the business of\ngranting the new deed can be done just the same?\"\n\n'\"Done?  Certainly not.  He must pay the renewal money, and sign the\nparchment in my presence.\"\n\n'She looked dubious.  \"Uncle is so dreadful nervous about law business,\"\nsays she, \"that, as you know, he's put it off and put it off for years;\nand now to-day really I've feared it would verily drive him out of his\nmind.  His poor three teeth quite chattered when I said to him that you\nwould be here soon with the parchment writing.  He always was afraid of\nagents, and folks that come for rent, and such-like.\"\n\n'\"Poor old fellow--I'm sorry for him.  Well, the thing can't be done\nunless I see him and witness his signature.\"\n\n'\"Suppose, sir, that you see him sign, and he don't see you looking at\nhim?  I'd soothe his nerves by saying you weren't strict about the form\nof witnessing, and didn't wish to come in.  So that it was done in your\nbare presence it would be sufficient, would it not?  As he's such an old,\nshrinking, shivering man, it would be a great considerateness on your\npart if that would do?\"\n\n'\"In my bare presence would do, of course--that's all I come for.  But\nhow can I be a witness without his seeing me?\"\n\n'\"Why, in this way, sir; if you'll oblige me by just stepping here.\"  She\nconducted him a few yards to the left, till they were opposite the\nparlour window.  The blind had been left up purposely, and the candle-\nlight shone out upon the garden bushes.  Within the agent could see, at\nthe other end of the room, the back and side of the old man's head, and\nhis shoulders and arm, sitting with the book and candle before him, and\nhis spectacles on his nose, as she had placed him.\n\n'\"He's reading his Bible, as you see, sir,\" she says, quite in her\nmeekest way.\n\n'\"Yes.  I thought he was a careless sort of man in matters of religion?\"\n\n'\"He always was fond of his Bible,\" Netty assured him.  \"Though I think\nhe's nodding over it just at this moment However, that's natural in an\nold man, and unwell.  Now you could stand here and see him sign, couldn't\nyou, sir, as he's such an invalid?\"\n\n'\"Very well,\" said the agent, lighting a cigar.  \"You have ready by you\nthe merely nominal sum you'll have to pay for the admittance, of course?\"\n\n'\"Yes,\" said Netty.  \"I'll bring it out.\"  She fetched the cash, wrapped\nin paper, and handed it to him, and when he had counted it the steward\ntook from his breast pocket the precious parchments and gave one to her\nto be signed.\n\n'\"Uncle's hand is a little paralyzed,\" she said.  \"And what with his\nbeing half asleep, too, really I don't know what sort of a signature\nhe'll be able to make.\"\n\n'\"Doesn't matter, so that he signs.\"\n\n'\"Might I hold his hand?\"\n\n'\"Ay, hold his hand, my young woman--that will be near enough.\"\n\n'Netty re-entered the house, and the agent continued smoking outside the\nwindow.  Now came the ticklish part of Netty's performance.  The steward\nsaw her put the inkhorn--\"horn,\" says I in my old-fashioned way--the\ninkstand, before her uncle, and touch his elbow as to arouse him, and\nspeak to him, and spread out the deed; when she had pointed to show him\nwhere to sign she dipped the pen and put it into his hand.  To hold his\nhand she artfully stepped behind him, so that the agent could only see a\nlittle bit of his head, and the hand she held; but he saw the old man's\nhand trace his name on the document.  As soon as 'twas done she came out\nto the steward with the parchment in her hand, and the steward signed as\nwitness by the light from the parlour window.  Then he gave her the deed\nsigned by the Squire, and left; and next morning Netty told the\nneighbours that her uncle was dead in his bed.'\n\n'She must have undressed him and put him there.'\n\n'She must.  Oh, that girl had a nerve, I can tell ye!  Well, to cut a\nlong story short, that's how she got back the house and field that were,\nstrictly speaking, gone from her; and by getting them, got her a husband.\n\n'Every virtue has its reward, they say.  Netty had hers for her ingenious\ncontrivance to gain Jasper.  Two years after they were married he took to\nbeating her--not hard, you know; just a smack or two, enough to set her\nin a temper, and let out to the neighbours what she had done to win him,\nand how she repented of her pains.  When the old Squire was dead, and his\nson came into the property, this confession of hers began to be whispered\nabout.  But Netty was a pretty young woman, and the Squire's son was a\npretty young man at that time, and wider-minded than his father, having\nno objection to little holdings; and he never took any proceedings\nagainst her.'\n\nThere was now a lull in the discourse, and soon the van descended the\nhill leading into the long straggling village.  When the houses were\nreached the passengers dropped off one by one, each at his or her own\ndoor.  Arrived at the inn, the returned emigrant secured a bed, and\nhaving eaten a light meal, sallied forth upon the scene he had known so\nwell in his early days.  Though flooded with the light of the rising\nmoon, none of the objects wore the attractiveness in this their real\npresentation that had ever accompanied their images in the field of his\nimagination when he was more than two thousand miles removed from them.\nThe peculiar charm attaching to an old village in an old country, as seen\nby the eyes of an absolute foreigner, was lowered in his case by\nmagnified expectations from infantine memories.  He walked on, looking at\nthis chimney and that old wall, till he came to the churchyard, which he\nentered.\n\nThe head-stones, whitened by the moon, were easily decipherable; and now\nfor the first time Lackland began to feel himself amid the village\ncommunity that he had left behind him five-and-thirty years before.  Here,\nbesides the Sallets, the Darths, the Pawles, the Privetts, the Sargents,\nand others of whom he had just heard, were names he remembered even\nbetter than those: the Jickses, and the Crosses, and the Knights, and the\nOlds.  Doubtless representatives of these families, or some of them, were\nyet among the living; but to him they would all be as strangers.  Far\nfrom finding his heart ready-supplied with roots and tendrils here, he\nperceived that in returning to this spot it would be incumbent upon him\nto re-establish himself from the beginning, precisely as though he had\nnever known the place, nor it him.  Time had not condescended to wait his\npleasure, nor local life his greeting.\n\nThe figure of Mr. Lackland was seen at the inn, and in the village\nstreet, and in the fields and lanes about Upper Longpuddle, for a few\ndays after his arrival, and then, ghost-like, it silently disappeared.  He\nhad told some of the villagers that his immediate purpose in coming had\nbeen fulfilled by a sight of the place, and by conversation with its\ninhabitants: but that his ulterior purpose--of coming to spend his latter\ndays among them--would probably never be carried out.  It is now a dozen\nor fifteen years since his visit was paid, and his face has not again\nbeen seen.\n\n","Loving you isn't the right thing to do.\nHow can I ever change things that I feel.\n\nIf I could, maybe I'd give you my world.\nHow can I, when you won't take it from me.\n\nYou can go your own way.\nGo your own way.\nYou can call it another lonely day.\nYou can go your own way.\n\nTell me why everything turned around.\nPacking up, shacking up is all you want to do.\n\nIf I could, baby I'd give you my world.\nOpen up, everything's waiting for you.\n\n","Brother","Thank you very much. And tonight, I have a high privilege and distinct honor of my own — as the first President to begin the State of the Union message with these words: Madam Speaker\nIn his day, the late Congressman Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. from Baltimore, Maryland, saw Presidents Roosevelt and Truman at this rostrum. But nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter, Nancy, presiding tonight as Speaker of the House of Representatives. Congratulations, Madam Speaker.\nTwo members of the House and Senate are not with us tonight, and we pray for the recovery and speedy return of Senator Tim Johnson and Congressman Charlie Norwood.\nMadam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:\nThe rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour — when decisions are hard and courage is needed. We enter the year 2007 with large endeavors underway, and others that are ours to begin. In all of this, much is asked of us. We must have the will to face difficult challenges and determined enemies — and the wisdom to face them together.\nSome in this chamber are new to the House and the Senate — and I congratulate the Democrat majority. Congress has changed, but not our responsibilities. Each of us is guided by our own convictions — and to these we must stay faithful. Yet we're all held to the same standards, and called to serve the same good purposes: To extend this nation's prosperity; to spend the people's money wisely; to solve problems, not leave them to future generations; to guard America against all evil; and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us.\nWe're not the first to come here with a government divided and uncertainty in the air. Like many before us, we can work through our differences, and achieve big things for the American people. Our citizens don't much care which side of the aisle we sit on — as long as we're willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done. Our job is to make life better for our fellow Americans, and to help them to build a future of hope and opportunity — and this is the business before us tonight.\nA future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy — and that is what we have. We're now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth, in a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs — so far. Unemployment is low, inflation is low, and wages are rising. This economy is on the move, and our job is to keep it that way, not with more government, but with more enterprise.\nNext week, I'll deliver a full report on the state of our economy. Tonight, I want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this Congress.\nFirst, we must balance the federal budget. We can do so without raising taxes. What we need is impose spending discipline in Washington, D.C. We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009, and met that goal three years ahead of schedule. Now let us take the next step. In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within the next five years. I ask you to make the same commitment. Together, we can restrain the spending appetite of the federal government, and we can balance the federal budget.\nNext, there is the matter of earmarks. These special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour — when not even C-SPAN is watching. In 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion. Even worse, over 90 percent of earmarks never make it to the floor of the House and Senate — they are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk. You didn't vote them into law. I didn't sign them into law. Yet, they're treated as if they have the force of law. The time has come to end this practice. So let us work together to reform the budget process, expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in Congress, and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of this session.\nAnd, finally, to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of entitlements. Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments of conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound. Yet, we're failing in that duty. And this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cuts in benefits. Everyone in this chamber knows this to be true — yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act. So let us work together and do it now. With enough good sense and goodwill, you and I can fix Medicare and Medicaid — and save Social Security.\nSpreading opportunity and hope in America also requires public schools that give children the knowledge and character they need in life. Five years ago, we rose above partisan differences to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, preserving local control, raising standards, and holding those schools accountable for results. And because we acted, students are performing better in reading and math, and minority students are closing the achievement gap.\nNow the task is to build on the success, without watering down standards, without taking control from local communities, and without backsliding and calling it reform. We can lift student achievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools, and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better. We must increase funds for students who struggle — and make sure these children get the special help they need. And we can make sure our children are prepared for the jobs of the future and our country is more competitive by strengthening math and science skills. The No Child Left Behind Act has worked for America's children — and I ask Congress to reauthorize this good law.\nA future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and available health care. When it comes to health care, government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, and poor children. And we will meet those responsibilities. For all other Americans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs. But many Americans cannot afford a health insurance policy.\nAnd so tonight, I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans afford their own insurance. First, I propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents. Families with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax — or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income. Single Americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of their income. With this reform, more than 100 million men, women, and children who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills. At the same time, this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health insurance through their job. For Americans who now purchase health insurance on their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings — $4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a year. And for the millions of other Americans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic private health insurance plan within their reach. Changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans.\nMy second proposal is to help the states that are coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured. States that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick. I have asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with Congress to take existing federal funds and use them to create \"Affordable Choices\" grants. These grants would give our nation's governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to those most in need.\nThere are many other ways that Congress can help. We need to expand Health Savings Accounts. We need to help small businesses through Association Health Plans. We need to reduce costs and medical errors with better information technology. We will encourage price transparency. And to protect good doctors from junk lawsuits, we passing medical liability reform. In all we do, we must remember that the best health care decisions are made not by government and insurance companies, but by patients and their doctors.\nExtending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system worthy of America — with laws that are fair and borders that are secure. When laws and borders are routinely violated, this harms the interests of our country. To secure our border, we're doubling the size of the Border Patrol, and funding new infrastructure and technology.\nYet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border — and that requires a temporary worker program. We should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis. As a result, they won't have to try to sneak in, and that will leave Border Agents free to chase down drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists. We'll enforce our immigration laws at the work site and give employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers, so there's no excuse left for violating the law.\nWe need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals. We need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty. Convictions run deep in this Capitol when it comes to immigration. Let us have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so that you can pass, and I can sign, comprehensive immigration reform into law.\nExtending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps America's economy running and America's environment clean. For too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil. And this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes, and to terrorists — who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments, and raise the price of oil, and do great harm to our economy.\nIt's in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply — the way forward is through technology. We must continue changing the way America generates electric power, by even greater use of clean coal technology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power. We need to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles, and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel. We must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol using everything from wood chips to grasses, to agricultural wastes.\nWe made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in Washington and the strong response of the market. And now even more dramatic advances are within reach. Tonight, I ask Congress to join me in pursuing a great goal. Let us build on the work we've done and reduce gasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years. When we do that we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we now import from the Middle East.\nTo reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017 — and that is nearly five times the current target. At the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks — and conserve up to 8.5 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017.\nAchieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but it's not going to eliminate it. And so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply, we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways. And to further protect America against severe disruptions to our oil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\nAmerica is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil. And these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment, and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change.\nA future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of justice. The lives of our citizens across our nation are affected by the outcome of cases pending in our federal courts. We have a shared obligation to ensure that the federal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timely rulings. As President, I have a duty to nominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the federal bench. And the United States Senate has a duty, as well, to give those nominees a fair hearing, and a prompt up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.\nFor all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger. Five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause. We've had time to take stock of our situation. We've added many critical protections to guard the homeland. We know with certainty that the horrors of that September morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us — unless we stop them.\nWith the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed. Such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions. Yet one question has surely been settled: that to win the war on terror we must take the fight to the enemy.\nFrom the start, America and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense. The enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary, easy movement, steady financing, and free flowing communications are long over. For the terrorists, life since 9/11 has never been the same.\nOur success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen. We cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented, but here is some of what we do know: We stopped an al Qaeda plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the West Coast. We broke up a Southeast Asian terror cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the United States. We uncovered an al Qaeda cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against America. And just last August, British authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean. For each life saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them.\nEvery success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy. The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world. And so long as that's the case, America is still a nation at war.\nIn the mind of the terrorist, this war began well before September the 11th, and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled. And these past five years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy. Al Qaeda and its followers are Sunni extremists, possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology. Take almost any principle of civilization, and their goal is the opposite. They preach with threats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent.\nOur enemies are quite explicit about their intentions. They want to overthrow moderate governments, and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country. By killing and terrorizing Americans, they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty. They would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology. Listen to this warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: \"We will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is even worse.\" Osama bin Laden declared: \"Death is better than living on this Earth with the unbelievers among us.\"\nThese men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in the Islamist radical movement. In recent times, it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from Shia extremists who are just as hostile to America, and are also determined to dominate the Middle East. Many are known to take direction from the regime in Iran, which is funding and arming terrorists like Hezbollah — a group second only to al Qaeda in the American lives it has taken.\nThe Shia and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat. Whatever slogans they chant, when they slaughter the innocent they have the same wicked purposes. They want to kill Americans, kill democracy in the Middle East, and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale.\nIn the sixth year since our nation was attacked, I wish I could report to you that the dangers had ended. They have not. And so it remains the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do our duty, to find these enemies, and to protect the American people.\nThis war is more than a clash of arms — it is a decisive ideological struggle, and the security of our nation is in the balance. To prevail, we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred, and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us. What every terrorist fears most is human freedom\n— societies where men and women make their own choices, answer to their own conscience, and live by their hopes instead of their resentments. Free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies — and most will choose a better way when they're given a chance. So we advance our own security interests by helping moderates and reformers and brave voices for democracy. The great question of our day is whether America will help men and women in the Middle East to build free societies and share in the rights of all humanity. And I say, for the sake of our own security, we must.\nIn the last two years, we've seen the desire for liberty in the broader Middle East — and we have been sobered by the enemy's fierce reaction. In 2005, the world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised the banner of the Cedar Revolution, they drove out the Syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections. In 2005, the people of Afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature. And in 2005, the Iraqi people held three national elections, choosing a transitional government, adopting the most progressive, democratic constitution in the Arab world, and then electing a government under that constitution. Despite endless threats from the killers in their midst, nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget.\nA thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, and in 2006 they struck back. In Lebanon, assassins took the life of Pierre Gemayel, a prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution. Hezbollah terrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to undermine Lebanon's legitimately elected government. In Afghanistan, Taliban and al Qaeda fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging Afghan and NATO forces. In Iraq, al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in Shia Islam — the Golden Mosque of Samarra. This atrocity, directed at a Muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke retaliation from Iraqi Shia — and it succeeded. Radical Shia elements, some of whom receive support from Iran, formed death squads. The result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day.\nThis is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we're in. Every one of us wishes this war were over and won. Yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and our own security at risk. Ladies and gentlemen: On this day, at this hour, it is still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle. Let us find our resolve, and turn events toward victory.\nWe're carrying out a new strategy in Iraq — a plan that demands more from Iraq's elected government, and gives our forces in Iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission. Our goal is a democratic Iraq that upholds the rule of law, respects the rights of its people, provides them security, and is an ally in the war on terror.\nIn order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital. But the Iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own. So we're deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq. The vast majority will go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods, and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army units. With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads. And in Anbar Province, where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we're sending an additional 4,000 United States Marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out. We didn't drive al Qaeda out of their safe haven in Afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in a free Iraq.\nThe people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now it's time for their government to act. Iraq's leaders know that our commitment is not open-ended. They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure Baghdad — and they must do so. They pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction or political party — and they need to follow through, and lift needless restrictions on Iraqi and coalition forces, so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of Baghdad. Iraq's leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks — to achieve reconciliation, to share oil revenues among all of Iraq's citizens, to put the wealth of Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow more Iraqis to re-enter their nation's civic life, to hold local elections, and to take responsibility for security in every Iraqi province. But for all of this to happen, Baghdad must be secure. And our plan will help the Iraqi government take back its capital and make good on its commitments.\nMy fellow citizens, our military commanders and I have carefully weighed the options. We discussed every possible approach. In the end, I chose this course of action because it provides the best chance for success. Many in this chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq, because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far-reaching.\nIf American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides. We could expect an epic battle between Shia extremists backed by Iran, and Sunni extremists aided by al Qaeda and supporters of the old regime. A contagion of violence could spill out across the country — and in time, the entire region could be drawn into the conflict.\nFor America, this is a nightmare scenario. For the enemy, this is the objective. Chaos is the greatest ally — their greatest ally in this struggle. And out of chaos in Iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens, new recruits, new resources, and an even greater determination to harm America. To allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and invite tragedy. Ladies and gentlemen, nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for America to succeed in the Middle East, to succeed in Iraq and to spare the American people from this danger.\nThis is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now. I have spoken with many of you in person. I respect you and the arguments you've made. We went into this largely united, in our assumptions and in our convictions. And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure. Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a chance to work. And I ask you to support our troops in the field, and those on their way.\nThe war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and I have turned our duties over to others. And that's why it's important to work together so our nation can see this great effort through. Both parties and both branches should work in close consultation. It's why I propose to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror, made up of leaders in Congress from both political parties. We will share ideas for how to position America to meet every challenge that confronts us. We'll show our enemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory.\nAnd one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military so that the American Armed Forces are ready for all the challenges ahead. Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the next five years. A second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteer Civilian Reserve Corps. Such a corps would function much like our military reserve. It would ease the burden on the Armed Forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when America needs them. It would give people across America who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time.\nAmericans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because we're not in this struggle alone. We have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against extremism. In Iraq, multinational forces are operating under a mandate from the United Nations. We're working with Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and the Gulf States to increase support for Iraq's government.\nThe United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran, and made it clear that the world will not allow the regime in Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons. With the other members of the Quartet — the U.N., the European Union, and Russia — we're pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the Holy Land, and pursuing the establishment of a democratic Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel in peace and security. In Afghanistan, NATO has taken the lead in turning back the Taliban and al Qaeda offensive — the first time the Alliance has deployed forces outside the North Atlantic area. Together with our partners in China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea, we're pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons.\nWe will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like Cuba, Belarus, and Burma [1] — and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of Darfur.\nAmerican foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy. Our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To whom much is given, much is required. We hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty and disease — and that is precisely what America is doing. We must continue to fight HIV/AIDS, especially on the continent of Africa. Because you funded our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the number of people receiving life-saving drugs has grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in three short years. I ask you to continue funding our efforts to fight HIV/AIDS. I ask you to provide $1.2 billion over five years so we can combat malaria in 15 African countries.\nI ask that you fund the Millennium Challenge Account, so that American aid reaches the people who need it, in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption is in retreat. And let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope for lifting lives and eliminating poverty.\nWhen America serves others in this way, we show the strength and generosity of our country. These deeds reflect the character of our people. The greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness, courage, and self-sacrifice of the American people. You see this spirit often if you know where to look — and tonight we need only look above to the gallery.\nDikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa, amid great poverty and disease. He came to Georgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine — but Coach John Thompson got a look at Dikembe and had a different idea. Dikembe became a star in the NBA, and a citizen of the United States. But he never forgot the land of his birth, or the duty to share his blessings with others. He built a brand new hospital in his old hometown. A friend has said of this good-hearted man: \"Mutombo believes that God has given him this opportunity to do great things.\" And we are proud to call this son of the Congo [2] a citizen of the United States of America.\nAfter her daughter was born, Julie Aigner-Clark searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child. So she borrowed some equipment, and began filming children's videos in her basement. The Baby Einstein Company was born, and in just five years her business grew to more than $20 million in sales. In November 2001, Julie sold Baby Einstein to the Walt Disney Company, and with her help Baby Einstein has grown into a $200 million business. Julie represents the great enterprising spirit of America. And she is using her success to help others — producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Julie says of her new project: \"I believe it's the most important thing that I have ever done. I believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe.\" And so tonight, we are pleased to welcome this talented business entrepreneur and generous social entrepreneur — Julie Aigner-Clark.\nThree weeks ago, Wesley Autrey was waiting at a Harlem subway station with his two little girls, when he saw a man fall into the path of a train. With seconds to act, Wesley jumped onto the tracks, pulled the man into the space between the rails, and held him as the train passed right above their heads. He insists he's not a hero. He says: \"We got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms. We have got to show each other some love.\" There is something wonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man like Wesley Autrey.\nTommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in Independence, Kentucky, when he enlisted in the United States Army. In December 2003, he was on a reconnaissance mission in Iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire. From his Humvee, Sergeant Rieman returned fire; he used his body as a shield to protect his gunner. He was shot in the chest and arm, and received shrapnel wounds to his legs — yet he refused medical attention, and stayed in the fight. He helped to repel a second attack, firing grenades at the enemy's position. For his exceptional courage, Sergeant Rieman was awarded the Silver Star. And like so many other Americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the respect and the gratitude of our entire country.\nIn such courage and compassion, ladies and gentlemen, we see the spirit and character of America — and these qualities are not in short supply. This is a decent and honorable country — and resilient, too. We've been through a lot together. We've met challenges and faced dangers, and we know that more lie ahead. Yet we can go forward with confidence — because the State of our Union is strong, our cause in the world is right, and tonight that cause goes on. God bless.\nSee you next year. Thank you for your prayers.\n","George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron (22 January 1788 – 19 April 1824), known as Lord Byron, was an English nobleman, poet, peer, politician, and leading figure in the Romantic movement. He is regarded as one of the greatest British poets and remains widely read and influential. Among his best-known works are the lengthy narrative poems Don Juan and ''Childe Harold's Pilgrimage'' as well as the short lyric poem \"She Walks in Beauty\". He travelled extensively across Europe, especially in Italy, where he lived for seven years in the cities of Venice, Ravenna and Pisa. During his stay in Italy he frequently visited his friend and fellow poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. Later in life Byron joined the Greek War of Independence fighting the Ottoman Empire, for which Greeks revere him as a national hero. He died in 1824 at the age of 36 from a fever contracted in Missolonghi. Often described as the most flamboyant and notorious of the major Romantics, Byron was both celebrated and castigated in his life for his aristocratic excesses, including huge debts, numerous love affairs with both men and women, as well as rumors of a scandalous liaison with his half-sister. His only legitimate child, Ada Lovelace, is regarded as the first computer programmer based on her notes for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Byron's illegitimate children include Allegra Byron, who died in childhood, and possibly Elizabeth Medora Leigh.\nEthel Colburn Mayne states that George Gordon Byron was born on 22 January 1788, in a house on 24 Holles Street in London. His birthplace is now occupied by a branch of the English department store John Lewis. However, Robert Charles Dallas in his Recollections states that Byron was born in Dover. Byron was the son of Captain John \"Mad Jack\" Byron and his second wife, the former Catherine Gordon (d. 1811), a descendant of Cardinal Beaton and heiress of the Gight estate in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Byron's father had previously seduced the married Marchioness of Carmarthen and, after she divorced her husband, he married her. His treatment of her was described as \"brutal and vicious\", and she died after having given birth to two daughters, only one of whom survived: Byron's half-sister, Augusta. To claim his second wife's estate in Scotland, Byron's father took the additional surname \"Gordon\", becoming \"John Byron Gordon\", and he was occasionally styled \"John Byron Gordon of Gight. \" Byron himself used this surname for a time and was registered at school in Aberdeen as \"George Byron Gordon. \" At the age of 10 he inherited the English Barony of Byron of Rochdale, becoming \"Lord Byron\", and eventually dropped the double surname. Byron's paternal grandparents were Vice-Admiral the Hon. John \"Foulweather Jack\" Byron, and Sophia Trevanion. Vice Admiral John Byron had circumnavigated the globe and was the younger brother of the 5th Baron Byron, known as \"the Wicked Lord\". He was christened at St Marylebone Parish Church \"George Gordon Byron\" after his maternal grandfather George Gordon of Gight, a descendant of James I of Scotland, who had committed suicide in 1779. \"Mad Jack\" Byron married his second wife for the same reason that he married his first: her fortune. Byron's mother had to sell her land and title to pay her new husband's debts, and in the space of two years the large estate, worth some £23,500, had been squandered, leaving the former heiress with an annual income in trust of only £150. In a move to avoid his creditors, Catherine accompanied her profligate husband to France in 1786, but returned to England at the end of 1787 to give birth to her son on English soil. He was born on 22 January in lodgings at Holles Street in London. Catherine moved back to Aberdeenshire in 1790, where Byron spent his childhood. His father soon joined them in their lodgings in Queen Street, but the couple quickly separated. Catherine regularly experienced mood swings and bouts of melancholy, which could be partly explained by her husband's continuing to borrow money from her. As a result, she fell even further into debt to support his demands. It was one of these importunate loans that allowed him to travel to Valenciennes, France, where he died in 1791. When Byron's great-uncle, the \"wicked\" Lord Byron, died on 21 May 1798, the 10-year-old boy became the 6th Baron Byron of Rochdale and inherited the ancestral home, Newstead Abbey, in Nottinghamshire. His mother proudly took him to England, but the Abbey was in an embarrassing state of disrepair and, rather than live there, she decided to lease it to Lord Grey de Ruthyn, among others, during Byron's adolescence. Described as \"a woman without judgment or self-command,\" Catherine either spoiled and indulged her son or vexed him with her capricious stubbornness. Her drinking disgusted him and he often mocked her for being short and corpulent, which made it difficult for her to catch him to discipline him. She once retaliated and, in a fit of temper, referred to him as \"a lame brat. \" However, Byron biographer, Doris Langley-Moore, in her 1974 book, Accounts Rendered, paints a more sympathetic view of Mrs Byron, showing how she was a staunch supporter of her son and sacrificed her own precarious finances to keep him in luxury at Harrow and Cambridge. Langley-Moore questions the Galt claim that she over-indulged in alcohol. Upon the death of Byron's mother-in-law Judith Noel, the Hon. Lady Milbanke, in 1822, her will required that he change his surname to \"Noel\" so as to inherit half of her estate. He obtained a Royal Warrant allowing him to \"take and use the surname of Noel only. \" The Royal Warrant also allowed him to \"subscribe the said surname of Noel before all titles of honour,\" and from that point he signed himself \"Noel Byron\" (the usual signature of a peer being merely the peerage, in this case simply \"Byron\"). It is speculated that this was so that his initials would read \"N.B. \", mimicking those of his hero, Napoleon Bonaparte. Lady Byron eventually succeeded to the Barony of Wentworth, becoming \"Lady Wentworth. \"\nByron received his early formal education at Aberdeen Grammar School, and in August 1799 entered the school of Dr. William Glennie, in Dulwich. Placed under the care of a Dr. Bailey, he was encouraged to exercise in moderation but could not restrain himself from \"violent\" bouts in an attempt to overcompensate for his deformed foot. His mother interfered with his studies, often withdrawing him from school, with the result that he lacked discipline and his classical studies were neglected. In 1801, he was sent to Harrow, where he remained until July 1805. An undistinguished student and an unskilled cricketer, he did represent the school during the very first Eton v Harrow cricket match at Lord's in 1805. His lack of moderation was not restricted to physical exercise. Byron fell in love with Mary Chaworth, whom he met while at school, and she was the reason he refused to return to Harrow in September 1803. His mother wrote, \"He has no indisposition that I know of but love, desperate love, the worst of all maladies in my opinion. In short, the boy is distractedly in love with Miss Chaworth. \" In Byron's later memoirs, \"Mary Chaworth is portrayed as the first object of his adult sexual feelings. \" Byron finally returned in January 1804, to a more settled period which saw the formation of a circle of emotional involvements with other Harrow boys, which he recalled with great vividness: \"My school friendships were with me passions (for I was always violent). \" The most enduring of those was with John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare—four years Byron's junior—whom he was to meet unexpectedly many years later in Italy . His nostalgic poems about his Harrow friendships, Childish Recollections, express a prescient \"consciousness of sexual differences that may in the end make England untenable to him. \" Letters to Byron in the John Murray archive contain evidence of a previously unremarked if short-lived romantic relationship with a younger boy at Harrow, John Thomas Claridge. The following autumn, he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he met and formed a close friendship with the younger John Edleston. About his \"protégé\" he wrote, \"He has been my almost constant associate since October, 1805, when I entered Trinity College. His voice first attracted my attention, his countenance fixed it, and his manners attached me to him for ever. \" In his memory Byron composed Thyrza, a series of elegies. In later years, he described the affair as \"a violent, though pure love and passion\". This statement, however, needs to be read in the context of hardening public attitudes toward homosexuality in England and the severe sanctions (including public hanging) against convicted or even suspected offenders. The liaison, on the other hand, may well have been \"pure\" out of respect for Edleston's innocence, in contrast to the (probably) more sexually overt relations experienced at Harrow School. Byron spent three years at Trinity College, engaging in sexual escapades, boxing, horse riding and gambling. Also while at Cambridge he formed lifelong friendships with men such as John Cam Hobhouse, who initiated him into the Cambridge Whig Club, which endorsed liberal politics, and Francis Hodgson, a Fellow at King's College, with whom he corresponded on literary and other matters until the end of his life.\nWhile not at school or college, Byron lived with his mother in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, in some antagonism. While there, he cultivated friendships with Elizabeth Pigot and her brother, John, with whom he staged two plays for the entertainment of the community. During this time, with the help of Elizabeth Pigot, who copied many of his rough drafts, he was encouraged to write his first volumes of poetry. Fugitive Pieces was printed by Ridge of Newark, which contained poems written when Byron was only 17. However, it was promptly recalled and burned on the advice of his friend, the Reverend J. T. Becher, on account of its more amorous verses, particularly the poem To Mary. Hours of Idleness, which collected many of the previous poems, along with more recent compositions, was the culminating book. The savage, anonymous criticism this received (now known to be the work of Henry Peter Brougham) in the Edinburgh Review prompted his first major satire, English Bards and Scotch Reviewers . It was put into the hands of his relation, R. C. Dallas, requesting him to \"...get it published without his name. \" Alexander Dallas gives a large series of changes and alterations, as well as the reasoning for some of them. He also states that Byron had originally intended to prefix an argument to this poem, and Dallas quotes it. Although the work was published anonymously, by April, R. C. Dallas is writing that \"you are already pretty generally known to be the author. \" The work so upset some of his critics they challenged Byron to a duel; over time, in subsequent editions, it became a mark of prestige to be the target of Byron's pen. After his return from travels he again entrusted R. C. Dallas as his literary agent to publish his poem ''Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, which Byron thought of little account. The first two cantos of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage'' were published in 1812 and were received with acclaim. In his own words, \"I awoke one morning and found myself famous. \" He followed up his success with the poem's last two cantos, as well as four equally celebrated \"Oriental Tales\": The Giaour, The Bride of Abydos, The Corsair and Lara. About the same time he began his intimacy with his future biographer, Thomas Moore.\nByron racked up numerous debts as a young man, owing to what his mother termed a \"reckless disregard for money\". She lived at Newstead during this time, in fear of her son's creditors. He had planned to spend early 1808 cruising with his cousin, George Bettesworth, who was captain of the 32-gun frigate HMS Tartar. Bettesworth's unfortunate death at the Battle of Alvøen in May 1808 made that impossible. From 1809 to 1811, Byron went on the Grand Tour, then customary for a young nobleman. He travelled with Hobhouse for the first year and his entourage of servants included the trusty butt of the young men's humour, William Fletcher, Byron's valet. The Napoleonic Wars forced him to avoid most of Europe, and he instead turned to the Mediterranean. The journey provided the opportunity to flee creditors, as well as a former love, Mary Chaworth (the subject of his poem from this time, \"To a Lady: On Being Asked My Reason for Quitting England in the Spring\"). Letters to Byron from his friend Charles Skinner Matthews reveal that a key motive was also the hope of homosexual experience. Attraction to the Levant was probably also a reason; he had read about the Ottoman and Persian lands as a child, was attracted to Islam (especially Sufi mysticism), and later wrote, \"With these countries, and events connected with them, all my really poetical feelings begin and end. \" Byron began his trip in Portugal from where he wrote a letter to his friend Mr. Hodgson in which he describes his mastery of the Portuguese language, consisting mainly of swearing and insults. Byron particularly enjoyed his stay in Sintra that is described in ''Childe Harold's Pilgrimage'' as \"glorious Eden\". From Lisbon he travelled overland to Seville, Jerez de la Frontera, Cádiz, Gibraltar and from there by sea on to Malta and Greece. Byron's correspondence and Journals from the Mediterranean, July 1809 – July 1811 Byron to Catherine Gordon Byron, from Gibraltar, 11 August 1809: \"I left Seville and rode on to Cadiz through a beautiful country, at Xeres where the Sherry we drink is made I met a great merchant a Mr Gordon of Scotland, who was extremely polite and favoured me with the Inspection of his vaults & cellars so that I quaffed at the Fountain head. – – Cadiz, sweet Cadiz! is the most delightful town I ever beheld... \" While in Athens, Byron met 14-year-old Nicolo Giraud, who became quite close and taught him Italian. It has been suggested that the two had an intimate relationship involving a sexual affair. Byron sent Giraud to school at a monastery in Malta and bequeathed him a sizeable sum of seven thousand pounds sterling. The will, however, was later cancelled. \"I am tired of pl & opt Cs, the last thing I could be tired of\", Byron wrote to Hobhouse from Athens (an abbreviation of \"coitum plenum et optabilem\" – complete intercourse to one's heart's desire, from Petronius's Satyricon), which, as an earlier letter establishes, was their shared code for homosexual experience. In 1810 in Athens Byron wrote Maid of Athens, ere we part for a 12-year-old girl, Teresa Makri (1798–1875), and reportedly offered £500 for her. The offer was not accepted. Byron made his way to Smyrna, where he and Hobhouse cadged a ride to Constantinople on HMS Salsette. While Salsette was anchored awaiting Ottoman permission to dock at the city, on 3 May 1810 Byron and Lieutenant Ekenhead, of Salsettes Marines, swam the Hellespont. Byron commemorated this feat in the second canto of Don Juan. He returned to England from Malta in July 1811 aboard .\nByron became a celebrity with the publication of the first two cantos of \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage\" . \"He rapidly became the most brilliant star in the dazzling world of Regency London. He was sought after at every society venue, elected to several exclusive clubs, and frequented the most fashionable London drawing-rooms. \" During this period in England he produced many works including The Giaour, The Bride of Abydos, Parisina and The Siege of Corinth (1815). Involved at first in an affair with Lady Caroline Lamb (who called him \"mad, bad and dangerous to know\") and with other lovers and also pressed by debt, he began to seek a suitable marriage, considering – amongst others – Annabella Millbanke. However, in 1813 he met for the first time in four years his half-sister, Augusta Leigh. Rumours of incest surrounded the pair; Augusta's daughter Medora (b. 1814) was suspected to have been Byron's. To escape from growing debts and rumours, Byron pressed his determination to marry Annabella, who was said to be the likely heiress of a rich uncle. They married on 2 January 1815, and their daughter, Ada, was born in December of that year. However Byron's continuing obsession with Augusta (and his continuing sexual escapades with actresses and others) made their marital life a misery. Annabella considered Byron insane, and in January 1816 she left him, taking their daughter, and began proceedings for a legal separation. Their separation was made legal in a private settlement in March 1816. The scandal of the separation, the rumours about Augusta, and ever-increasing debts forced him to leave England in April 1816, never to return.\nAfter this break-up of his domestic life, Byron left England and never returned.(Despite his dying wishes, however, his body was returned for burial in England.) He journeyed through Belgium and continued up the Rhine river. In the summer of 1816 he settled at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva, Switzerland, with his personal physician, the young, brilliant and handsome John William Polidori. There Byron befriended the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Shelley's future wife Mary Godwin. He was also joined by Mary's stepsister, Claire Clairmont, with whom he had had an affair in London. Kept indoors at the Villa Diodati by the \"incessant rain\" of \"that wet, ungenial summer\" over three days in June, the five turned to reading fantastical stories, including Fantasmagoriana, and then devising their own tales. Mary Shelley produced what would become Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus, and Polidori was inspired by a fragmentary story of Byron's, \"A Fragment\", to produce The Vampyre, the progenitor of the romantic vampire genre. Byron's story fragment was published as a postscript to Mazeppa; he also wrote the third canto of Childe Harold. Byron wintered in Venice, pausing his travels when he fell in love with Marianna Segati, in whose Venice house he was lodging, and who was soon replaced by 22-year-old Margarita Cogni; both women were married. Cogni could not read or write, and she left her husband to move into Byron's Venice house. Their fighting often caused Byron to spend the night in his gondola; when he asked her to leave the house, she threw herself into the Venetian canal.\nIn 1816, Byron visited San Lazzaro degli Armeni in Venice, where he acquainted himself with Armenian culture with the help of the monks belonging to the Mechitarist Order. With the help of Father Pascal Aucher (Harutiun Avkerian), he learned the Armenian language, and attended many seminars about language and history. He co-authored Grammar English and Armenian in 1817, an English textbook written by Aucher and corrected by Byron, and A Grammar Armenian and English in 1819, a project initiated by him of a grammar of Classical Armenian for English speakers, where he included quotations from classical and modern Armenian. Byron later participated in the compilation of the English Armenian dictionary (Barraran angleren yev hayeren, 1821) and wrote the preface in which he explained the relationship of the Armenians with and the oppression of the Turkish \"pashas\" and the Persian satraps, and their struggle of liberation. His two main translations are the Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, two chapters of Movses Khorenatsi's History of Armenia and sections of Nerses of Lambron's Orations. His fascination was so great that he even considered a replacement of the Cain story of the Bible with that of the legend of Armenian patriarch Haik. He may be credited with the birth of Armenology and its propagation. His profound lyricism and ideological courage has inspired many Armenian poets, the likes of Ghevond Alishan, Smbat Shahaziz, Hovhannes Tumanyan, Ruben Vorberian and others. In 1817, he journeyed to Rome. On returning to Venice, he wrote the fourth canto of Childe Harold. About the same time, he sold Newstead and published Manfred, Cain and The Deformed Transformed. The first five cantos of Don Juan were written between 1818 and 1820, during which period he made the acquaintance of the 18 year old Countess Guiccioli, who found her first love in Byron, who in turn asked her to elope with him. Led by the love for this local aristocratic and married young Teresa Guiccioli, Byron lived in Ravenna between 1819 and 1821. Here he continued Don Juan and wrote the Ravenna Diary and My Dictionary and Recollections. It was about this time that he received visits from Shelley, as well as from Thomas Moore, to whom he confided his autobiography or \"life and adventures\", which Moore, Hobhouse, and Byron's publisher, John Murray, burned in 1824, a month after Byron's death. Of Byron's lifestyle in Ravenna we know more from Shelley, who documented some of its more colourful aspects in a letter: \"Lord Byron gets up at two. I get up, quite contrary to my usual custom … at 12. After breakfast we sit talking till six. From six to eight we gallop through the pine forest which divide Ravenna from the sea; we then come home and dine, and sit up gossiping till six in the morning. I don’t suppose this will kill me in a week or fortnight, but I shall not try it longer. Lord B.’s establishment consists, besides servants, of ten horses, eight enormous dogs, three monkeys, five cats, an eagle, a crow, and a falcon; and all these, except the horses, walk about the house, which every now and then resounds with their unarbitrated quarrels, as if they were the masters of it… . [P.S.] I find that my enumeration of the animals in this Circean Palace was defective … . I have just met on the grand staircase five peacocks, two guinea hens, and an Egyptian crane. I wonder who all these animals were before they were changed into these shapes. From 1821 to 1822, he finished Cantos 6–12 of Don Juan at Pisa, and in the same year he joined with Leigh Hunt and Shelley in starting a short-lived newspaper, The Liberal, in the first number of which appeared The Vision of Judgment. For the first time since his arrival in Italy, Byron found himself tempted to give dinner parties; his guests included the Shelleys, Edward Ellerker Williams, Thomas Medwin, John Taaffe and Edward John Trelawney; and \"never\", as Shelley said, \"did he display himself to more advantage than on these occasions; being at once polite and cordial, full of social hilarity and the most perfect good humour; never diverging into ungraceful merriment, and yet keeping up the spirit of liveliness throughout the evening. \" Shelley and Williams rented a house on the coast and had a schooner built. Byron decided to have his own yacht, and engaged Trelawny's friend, Captain Daniel Roberts, to design and construct the boat. Named the Bolivar, it was later sold to Charles John Gardiner, 1st Earl of Blessington, and Marguerite, Countess of Blessington, when Byron left for Greece in 1823. Byron attended the funeral of Shelley, which was orchestrated by Trelawney after Williams and Shelley drowned in a boating accident on 8 July 1822. His last Italian home was Genoa, where he was still accompanied by the Countess Guiccioli, and the Blessingtons, providing the material for Lady Blessington's work: Conversations with Lord Byron, an important text in the reception of Byron in the period immediately after his death.\nByron was living in Genoa when, in 1823, while growing bored with his life there, he accepted overtures for his support from representatives of the movement for Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire. At first, Byron did not wish to abandon his twenty-two year old mistress Countess Teresa Guiccioli who had abandoned her husband to live with him; ultimately Guiccioli's father, Count Gamba was allowed to leave his exile in the Romagna under the condition that his daughter return to him, without Byron. At the same time that the philhellene Edward Blaquiere was attempting to recruit him, Byron was confused as to what he was supposed to do in Greece, writing: \"Blaquiere seemed to think that I might be of some use-even here;-though what he did not exactly specify\". With the assistance of his banker and Captain Daniel Roberts, Byron chartered the brig Hercules to take him to Greece. When Byron left Genoa, it caused \"passionate grief\" from Guiccioli, who wept openly as he sailed away to Greece, though the Hercules was forced to return to port shortly afterwards, and when the Hercules set sail for the final time Guiccioli had left. On 16 July, Byron left Genoa arriving at Kefalonia in the Ionian Islands on 4 August. His voyage is covered in detail in Byron historian Donald Prell's Sailing with Byron from Genoa to Cephalonia. Prell also wrote of a coincidence in Byron's chartering the Hercules. The vessel was launched only a few miles south of Seaham Hall, where in 1815 Byron married Annabella Milbanke. Between 1815 and 1823 the vessel was in service between England and Canada. Suddenly in 1823, the ship's Captain decided to sail to Genoa and offer the Hercules for charter. After taking Byron to Greece, the ship returned to England, never again to venture into the Mediterranean. The Hercules was aged 37 when, on 21 September 1852, her life ended when she went aground near Hartlepool, only 25 miles south of Sunderland, where in 1815, her keel was laid; Byron's \"keel was laid\" nine months before his official birth date, 22 January 1788; therefore in ship-years, he was aged 37, when he died in Missolonghi. Byron initially stayed on the island of Kephalonia, where he was besieged by agents of the rival Greek factions, all of whom wanted to recruit Byron to their own cause. The Ionian islands, of which Kefalonia is one, were under British rule until 1864. Byron spent £4,000 of his own money to refit the Greek fleet. When Byron travelled to the mainland of Greece on the night of 28 December 1823, Byron's ship was surprised by an Ottoman warship, which did not attack his ship as the Ottoman captain mistook Byron's boat for a fireship. To avoid the Ottoman Navy, which he encountered several times on his voyage, Byron was forced to take a roundabout route and only reached Missolonghi on 5 January 1824. After arriving in Missolonghi, Byron joined forces with Alexandros Mavrokordatos, a Greek politician with military power. Byron moved on the second floor of a two-story house and was forced much of his time dealing with unruly Souliots who demanded that Byron pay them the back-pay owed to them by the Greek government. Byron gave the Souliots some £6, 000 pounds. Byron was supposed to lead an attack on the Ottoman fortress of Navpaktos, whose Albanian garrison were unhappy owing to pay arrears and were offering to put up only token resistance if Byron was willing to bribe them into surrendering, but Ottoman commander, Yussuf Pasha solved the problem by executing the mutinous Albanian officers who were offering to surrender Navpaktos to Byron and arranging to have some of the pay arrears paid out to the rest of the garrison. Byron never led the attack on Navpaktos as the Souliots kept demanding that Byron pay them more and more money before they would march, before Byron who was growing tired of their blackmail sent them all home on 15 February 1824. Byron wrote in a note to himself: \"Having tried in vain at every expence-considerable trouble-and some danger to unite the Suliotes for the good of Greece-and their own-I have come to the following resolution-I will have nothing more to do with the Suliotes-they may go to the Turks or the devil...they may cut me into more pieces than they have dissensions among them, sooner than change my resolution\". At the same time, Guiccioli's brother, Pietro Gamba who followed Byron to Greece exasperated Byron with his incompetence as he consistently made expensive mistakes, for example, when asked to buy some cloth from Corfu, Gamba ordered the wrong cloth in excess, leading to the bill being ten times higher than what Byron wanted. Byron wrote about his right-hand man: \"Gamba-who is anything but lucky-had something to do with it-and as usual-the moment he had-matters went wrong\". To help raise money for the revolution, Byron sold his estate Rochdale Manor in Scotland, which raised some £11, 250 pound sterling, which led Byron to estimate that he now had some £20, 000 pounds at his disposal, all of which he planned to spend on the Greek cause. In today's money Byron would have been a millionaire many times over, and the news that a fabulously wealthy British aristocrat known for his generosity in spending money had arrived in Greece made Byron the object of much solicitation in a desperately poor country like Greece. Byron wrote to his business agent in Scotland \"I should not like to give the Greeks but a half helping hand\", saying he would wanted to spend his entire fortune on Greek freedom. Byron found himself besieged by various people, both Greek and foreign who were always trying to persuade Byron to open up his pocketbook to support them, and by end of March 1824, the so-called \"Byron brigade\" of 30 philhellene officers and about 200 men had been formed, paid for entirely by Byron. Leadership of the Greek cause in the Roumeli region was divided between two rival leaders, a former Klepht (bandit) Odysseas Androutsos and a wealthy Phanariot merchant Alexandros Mavrokordatos, and Byron used his prestige to attempt to persuade the two rival leaders to come together to focus on defeating the Ottomans. At same time, other leaders of the Greek factions like Petrobey Mavromichalis and Theodoros Kolokotronis were writing letters to Byron telling him to disregard all of the Roumeliot leaders and to come to their respective areas in the Peloponnese, which drove Byron to distraction as he complained that the Greeks were hopelessly disunited and spent more time feuding with each other than in trying to win independence. Byron's friend Edward John Trelawny had aligned himself with Androutsos, who ruled Athens and was now pressing for Byron to break with Mavrokordatos in favour of backing his rival Androutsos. Androutsos, having won over Trelawny to his cause, was now anxious to win the real prize by persuading Byron to put his wealth behind his claim to be the leader of Greece. Byron wrote with disgust how one of the Greek captains, a former Klepht Georgios Karaiskakis attacked Missolonghi on 3 April 1824 with some 150 men supported by the Souliots as he was unhappy with Mavrokordatos's leadership, leading to a brief bout of inter-Greek fighting before Karaiskais was chased away by 6 April. Byron adopted a nine year old Turkish Muslim girl called Hato whose parents had been killed by the Greeks, and whom he ultimately sent to safety in Kephalonia, knowing well that religious hatred between the Orthodox Greeks and Muslim Turks were running high and any Muslim in Greece, even a child, was in serious danger. Until 1934, most Turks did not have surnames, so Hato's lack of a surname was quite typical for a Turkish family at this time. During this time, Byron pursued his Greek page, Lukas Chalandritsanos, with whom he had fallen madly in love, but the affections went unrequited. Byron was infatuated with the teenage Chalandritsanos, whom he spoiled outrageously, spending some £600 (the equivalent to about £24,600 in today's money) to cater to his every whim over the course of six months and wrote his last poems about his passion for the Greek boy, but Chalandritsanos was only interested in Byron's money. When the famous Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen heard about Byron's heroics in Greece, he voluntarily resculpted his earlier bust of Byron in Greek marble.\nMavrokordatos and Byron planned to attack the Turkish-held fortress of Lepanto, at the mouth of the Gulf of Corinth. Byron employed a fire-master to prepare artillery and took part of the rebel army under his own command, despite his lack of military experience. Before the expedition could sail, on 15 February 1824, he fell ill, and bloodletting weakened him further. He made a partial recovery, but in early April he caught a violent cold, which therapeutic bleeding, insisted on by his doctors, aggravated. It is suspected this treatment, carried out with unsterilised medical instruments, may have caused him to develop sepsis. He developed a violent fever, and died in Missolonghi on 19 April. His physician at the time, Julius van Millingen, son of Dutch-English archaeologist James Millingen, was unable to prevent his death. It has been said that if Byron had lived and had gone on to defeat the Ottomans, he might have been declared King of Greece. However, contemporary scholars have found such an outcome unlikely. The British historian David Brewer wrote that in one sense, Byron was a failure in Greece as he failed to persuade the rival Greek factions to unite and he did not achieve any military victories, being successful only in the humanitarian sphere, using his great wealth to help the victims of the war, Muslim and Christian, but this did not affect the outcome of the Greek war of independence one iota. Brewer went on to argue \"In another sense, though, Byron achieved everything he could have wished. His presence in Greece, and in particular his death there, drew to the Greek cause not just the attention of sympathetic nations, but their increasing active participation...Despite the critics, Byron is primarily remembered with admiration as a poet of genius, with something approaching veneration as a symbol of high ideals, and with great affection as a man: for his courage and his ironic slant on life, for his generosity to the grandest of causes and to the humblest of individuals, for the constant interplay of judgement and sympathy. In Greece he is still revered as no other foreigner, and as very few Greeks are, and like a Homeric hero he is accorded an honorific standard epithet, megalos kai kalos, a great and good man\".\nAlfred Tennyson would later recall the shocked reaction in Britain when word was received of Byron's death. The Greeks mourned Lord Byron deeply, and he became a hero. The national poet of Greece, Dionysios Solomos, wrote a poem about the unexpected loss, named To the Death of Lord Byron. Βύρων, the Greek form of \"Byron\", continues in popularity as a masculine name in Greece, and a town near Athens is called Vyronas in his honour. Byron's body was embalmed, but the Greeks wanted some part of their hero to stay with them. According to some sources, his heart remained at Missolonghi. His other remains were sent to England (accompanied by his faithful manservant, \"Tita\") for burial in Westminster Abbey, but the Abbey refused for reason of \"questionable morality\". Huge crowds viewed his coffin as he lay in state for two days in London. He is buried at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A marble slab given by the King of Greece is laid directly above Byron's grave. His daughter, Ada Lovelace, was later buried beside him. Byron's friends raised the sum of 1,000 pounds to commission a statue of the writer; Thorvaldsen offered to sculpt it for that amount. However, for ten years after the statue was completed in 1834, most British institutions turned it down, and it remained in storage. The statue was refused by the British Museum, [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], Westminster Abbey and the National Gallery before Trinity College, Cambridge, finally placed the statue of Byron in its library. In 1969, 145 years after Byron's death, a memorial to him was finally placed in Westminster Abbey. The memorial had been lobbied for since 1907: The New York Times wrote, \"People are beginning to ask whether this ignoring of Byron is not a thing of which England should be ashamed ... a bust or a tablet might be put in the Poets' Corner and England be relieved of ingratitude toward one of her really great sons. \" Robert Ripley had drawn a picture of Boatswain's grave with the caption \"Lord Byron's dog has a magnificent tomb while Lord Byron himself has none\". This came as a shock to the English, particularly schoolchildren, who, Ripley said, raised funds of their own accord to provide the poet with a suitable memorial. (Source: ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'', 3rd Series, 1950; p. xvi.) Close to the centre of Athens, Greece, outside the National Garden, is a statue depicting Greece in the form of a woman crowning Byron. The statue is by the French sculptors Henri-Michel Chapu and Alexandre Falguière. Since 2008, the anniversary of Byron's death, 19 April, has been honoured in Greece as \"Byron Day\". Upon his death, the barony passed to Byron's cousin George Anson Byron, a career naval officer.\nByron described his first intense feelings at age eight for his distant cousin, Mary Duff: My mother used always to rally me about this childish amour, and at last, many years after, when I was sixteen, she told me one day, 'O Byron, I have had a letter from Edinburgh, and your old sweetheart, Mary Duff, is married to Mr. C***.' And what was my answer? I really cannot explain or account for my feelings at that moment, but they nearly threw me into convulsions...How the deuce did all this occur so early? Where could it originate? I certainly had no sexual ideas for years afterwards; and yet my misery, my love for that girl were so violent, that I sometimes doubt if I have ever been really attached since. Be that as it may, hearing of her marriage several years after was like a thunder-stroke – it nearly choked me – to the horror of my mother and the astonishment and almost incredulity of every body. And it is a phenomenon in my existence (for I was not eight years old) which has puzzled, and will puzzle me to the latest hour of it; and lately, I know not why, the recollection (not the attachment) has recurred as forcibly as ever...But, the more I reflect, the more I am bewildered to assign any cause for this precocity of affection. Byron also became attached to Margaret Parker, another distant cousin. While his recollection of his love for Mary Duff is that he was ignorant of adult sexuality during this time, and was bewildered as to the source of the intensity of his feelings, he would later confess that: My passions were developed very early – so early, that few would believe me – if I were to state the period – and the facts which accompanied it. Perhaps this was one of the reasons that caused the anticipated melancholy of my thoughts – having anticipated life. This is the only reference Byron himself makes to the event, and he is ambiguous as to how old he was when it occurred. After his death, his lawyer wrote to a mutual friend telling him a \"singular fact\" about Byron's life which was \"scarcely fit for narration\". But he disclosed it nonetheless, thinking it might explain Byron's sexual \"propensities\": When nine years old at his mother's house a Free Scotch girl [May, sometimes called Mary, Gray, one of his first caretakers] used to come to bed to him and play tricks with his person. Gray later used this sexual abuse as a means of ensuring his silence if he were to be tempted to disclose the \"low company\" she kept during drinking binges. She was later dismissed, supposedly for beating Byron when he was 11. A few years later, while he was still a child, Lord Grey De Ruthyn (unrelated to May Gray), a suitor of his mother's, also made sexual advances on him. Byron's personality has been characterised as exceptionally proud and sensitive, especially when it came to his deformity. And although Byron was a very self-centred individual, it is probable that like most children, he would have been deeply disturbed by these sexual advances. His extreme reaction to seeing his mother flirting outrageously with Lord Grey De Ruthyn after the incident suggests this; he did not tell her of Grey's conduct toward him, he simply refused to speak to him again and ignored his mother's commands to be reconciled. Leslie A. Marchand, one of Byron's biographers, theorises that Lord Grey De Ruthyn's advances prompted Byron's later sexual liaisons with young men at Harrow and Cambridge. Scholars acknowledge a more or less important bisexual component in Byron's very complex sentimental and sexual life. Bernhard Jackson asserts that \"Byron's sexual orientation has long been a difficult, not to say contentious, topic, and anyone who seeks to discuss it must to some degree speculate, since the evidence is nebulous, contradictory and scanty... it is not so simple to define Byron as homosexual or heterosexual: he seems rather to have been both, and either. \" Crompton states: \"What was not understood in Byron's own century (except by a tiny circle of his associates) was that Byron was bisexual\". Another biographer, Fiona MacCarthy, has posited that Byron's true sexual yearnings were for adolescent males. Byron notably used a code by which he communicated his homosexual Greek adventures to John Hobhouse in England: Bernhard Jackson recalls that \"Byron's early code for sex with a boy\" was \"Plen(um). and optabil(em). -Coit(um)\" Bullough summarizes: }} In 1812, Byron embarked on a well-publicised affair with the married Lady Caroline Lamb that shocked the British public. She had spurned the attention of the poet on their first meeting, subsequently giving Byron what became his lasting epitaph when she famously described him as \"mad, bad and dangerous to know\". This did not prevent her from pursuing him.<ref name=\"timesonline\"> Byron eventually broke off the relationship, and moved swiftly on to others (such as that with Lady Oxford), but Lamb never entirely recovered, pursuing him even after he tired of her. She was emotionally disturbed, and lost so much weight that Byron sarcastically commented to her mother-in-law, his friend Lady Melbourne, that he was \"haunted by a skeleton\". She began to call on him at home, sometimes dressed in disguise as a pageboy, at a time when such an act could ruin both of them socially. One day, during such a visit, she wrote on a book at his desk, \"Remember me!\" As a retort, Byron wrote a poem entitled Remember Thee! Remember Thee! which concludes with the line \"Thou false to him, thou fiend to me\". As a child, Byron had seen little of his half-sister Augusta Leigh; in adulthood, he formed a close relationship with her that has been interpreted by some as incestuous, and by others as innocent. Augusta (who was married) gave birth on 15 April 1814 to her third daughter, Elizabeth Medora Leigh, rumoured by some to be Byron's. Eventually Byron began to court Lady Caroline's cousin Anne Isabella Milbanke (\"Annabella\"), who refused his first proposal of marriage but later accepted him. Milbanke was a highly moral woman, intelligent and mathematically gifted; she was also an heiress. They married at Seaham Hall, County Durham, on 2 January 1815. The marriage proved unhappy. He treated her poorly. They had a daughter (Augusta Ada). On 16 January 1816, Lady Byron left him, taking Ada with her. That same year (21 April), Byron signed the Deed of Separation. Rumours of marital violence, adultery with actresses, incest with Augusta Leigh, and sodomy were circulated, assisted by a jealous Lady Caroline. In a letter, Augusta quoted him as saying: \"Even to have such a thing said is utter destruction and ruin to a man from which he can never recover. \" That same year Lady Caroline published her popular novel Glenarvon, wherein Lord Byron was portrayed as the seedy character Lord Ruthven.\nByron wrote a letter to John Hanson from Newstead Abbey, dated 17 January 1809, that includes \"You will discharge my Cook, & Laundry Maid, the other two I shall retain to take care of the house, more especially as the youngest is pregnant (I need not tell you by whom) and I cannot have the girl on the parish. \" His reference to \"The youngest\" is understood to have been to a maid, Lucy, and the parenthesised remark to indicate himself as siring a son born that year. In 2010 part of a baptismal record was uncovered which apparently said: \"September 24 George illegitimate son of Lucy Monk, illegitimate son of Baron Byron, of Newstead, Nottingham, Newstead Abbey. \" Augusta Leigh's child, Elizabeth Medora Leigh, born 1814, was very likely fathered by Byron, who was Augusta's half-brother. Byron had a child, The Hon. Augusta Ada Byron (\"Ada\", later Countess of Lovelace), in 1815, by his wife Annabella Byron, Lady Byron (née Anne Isabella Milbanke, or \"Annabella\"), later Lady Wentworth. Ada Lovelace, notable in her own right, collaborated with Charles Babbage on the analytical engine, a predecessor to modern computers. She is recognised as the world's first computer programmer. He also had an illegitimate child in 1817, Clara Allegra Byron, with Claire Clairmont, stepsister of Mary Shelley and stepdaughter of William Godwin, writer of Political Justice and Caleb Williams. Allegra is not entitled to the style \"The Hon. \" as is usually given to the daughter of barons, since she was illegitimate. Born in Bath in 1817, Allegra lived with Byron for a few months in Venice; he refused to allow an Englishwoman caring for the girl to adopt her, and objected to her being raised in the Shelleys' household. He wished for her to be brought up Catholic and not marry an Englishman, and made arrangements for her to inherit 5,000 lira upon marriage, or when she reached the age of 21, provided she did not marry a native of Britain. However, the girl died aged five of a fever in Bagna Cavallo, Italy while Byron was in Pisa; he was deeply upset by the news. He had Allegra's body sent back to England to be buried at his old school, Harrow, because Protestants could not be buried in consecrated ground in Catholic countries. At one time he himself had wanted to be buried at Harrow. Byron was indifferent towards Allegra's mother, Claire Clairmont.\nByron enjoyed adventure, especially relating to the sea. The first recorded notable example of open water swimming took place on 3 May 1810 when Lord Byron swam from Europe to Asia across the Hellespont Strait. This is often seen as the birth of the sport and pastime, and to commemorate it, the event is recreated every year as an open water swimming event. Whilst sailing from Genoa to Cephalonia in 1823, every day at noon, Byron and Trelawny, in calm weather, jumped overboard for a swim without fear of sharks, which were not unknown in those waters. Once, according to Trelawny, they let the geese and ducks loose and followed them and the dogs into the water, each with an arm in the ship Captain’s new scarlet waistcoat, to the annoyance of the Captain and the amusement of the crew.\nByron had a great love of animals, most notably for a Newfoundland dog named Boatswain. When the animal contracted rabies, Byron nursed him, albeit unsuccessfully, without any thought or fear of becoming bitten and infected. Although deep in debt at the time, Byron commissioned an impressive marble funerary monument for Boatswain at Newstead Abbey, larger than his own, and the only building work which he ever carried out on his estate. In his 1811 will, Byron requested that he be buried with him. The 26‐line poem \"Epitaph to a Dog\" has become one of his best-known works, but a draft of an 1830 letter by Hobhouse shows him to be the author, and that Byron decided to use Hobhouse's lengthy epitaph instead of his own, which read: \"To mark a friend's remains these stones arise/I never knew but one – and here he lies. \" Byron also kept a tame bear while he was a student at Trinity, out of resentment for rules forbidding pet dogs like his beloved Boatswain. There being no mention of bears in their statutes, the college authorities had no legal basis for complaining: Byron even suggested that he would apply for a college fellowship for the bear. During his lifetime, in addition to numerous cats, dogs, and horses, Byron kept a fox, monkeys, an eagle, a crow, a falcon, peacocks, guinea hens, an Egyptian crane, a badger, geese, a heron, and a goat. Except for the horses, they all resided indoors at his homes in England, Switzerland, Italy, and Greece.\nI am such a strange mélange of good and evil that it would be difficult to describe me. As a boy, Byron's character is described as a \"mixture of affectionate sweetness and playfulness, by which it was impossible not to be attached\", although he also exhibited \"silent rages, moody sullenness and revenge\" with a precocious bent for attachment and obsession.\nFrom birth, Byron suffered from a deformity of his right foot. Although it has generally been referred to as a \"club foot\", some modern medical authors maintain that it was a consequence of infantile paralysis (poliomyelitis), and others that it was a dysplasia, a failure of the bones to form properly. Whatever the cause, he was afflicted with a limp that caused him lifelong psychological and physical misery, aggravated by painful and pointless \"medical treatment\" in his childhood and the nagging suspicion that with proper care it might have been cured. He was extremely self-conscious about this from a young age, nicknaming himself (French for \"the limping devil\", after the nickname given to Asmodeus by Alain-René Lesage in his 1707 novel of the same name). Although he often wore specially-made shoes in an attempt to hide the deformed foot, he refused to wear any type of brace that might improve the limp. Scottish novelist John Galt felt his oversensitivity to the \"innocent fault in his foot was unmanly and excessive\" because the limp was \"not greatly conspicuous\". He first met Byron on a voyage to Sardinia and did not realise he had any deficiency for several days, and still could not tell at first if the lameness was a temporary injury or not but by the time he met Byron he was an adult and had worked to develop \"a mode of walking across a room by which it was scarcely at all perceptible\". The motion of the ship at sea may also have helped to create a favourable first impression and hide any deficiencies in his gait, but Galt's biography is also described as being \"rather well-meant than well-written\", so Galt may be guilty of minimising a defect that was actually still noticeable.\nByron's adult height was 5 ft, his weight fluctuating between and 14 stone. He was renowned for his personal beauty, which he enhanced by wearing curl-papers in his hair at night. He was athletic, being a competent boxer and horse-rider and an excellent swimmer. He attended pugilistic tuition at the Bond Street rooms of former prizefighting champion ‘Gentleman’ John Jackson, and recorded these sparring sessions, with the man he called ‘the Emperor of Pugilism’, in his letters and journals. Byron and other writers, such as his friend Hobhouse, described his eating habits in detail. At the time he entered Cambridge, he went on a strict diet to control his weight. He also exercised a great deal, and at that time wore a great number of clothes to cause himself to perspire. For most of his life he was a vegetarian, and often lived for days on dry biscuits and white wine. Occasionally he would eat large helpings of meat and desserts, after which he would purge himself. Although he is described by Galt and others as having a predilection for \"violent\" exercise, Hobhouse suggests that the pain in his deformed foot made physical activity difficult, and his weight problem was the result.\nByron first took his seat in the House of Lords 13 March 1809, but left London on 11 June 1809 for the Continent. A strong advocate of social reform, he received particular praise as one of the few Parliamentary defenders of the Luddites: specifically, he was against a death penalty for Luddite \"frame breakers\" in Nottinghamshire, who destroyed textile machines that were putting them out of work. His first speech before the Lords, on 27 February 1812, was loaded with sarcastic references to the \"benefits\" of automation, which he saw as producing inferior material as well as putting people out of work, and concluded the proposed law was only missing two things to be effective: \"Twelve Butchers for a Jury and a Jeffries for a Judge!\". Byron's speech was officially recorded and printed in Hansard. He said later that he \"spoke very violent sentences with a sort of modest impudence\", and thought he came across as \"a bit theatrical\". The full text of the speech, which he had previously written out, was presented to Dallas in manuscript form and he quotes it in his work. Two months later, Byron made another impassioned speech before the House of Lords in support of Catholic emancipation. Byron expressed opposition to the established religion because it was unfair to people of other faiths. These experiences inspired Byron to write political poems such as Song for the Luddites and ''The Landlords' Interest, Canto XIV of The Age of Bronze''. Examples of poems in which he attacked his political opponents include Wellington: The Best of the Cut-Throats ; and The Intellectual Eunuch Castlereagh (1818).\nByron wrote prolifically. In 1832 his publisher, John Murray, released the complete works in 14 duodecimo volumes, including a life by Thomas Moore. Subsequent editions were released in 17 volumes, first published a year later, in 1833.\nByron's magnum opus, Don Juan, a poem spanning 17 cantos, ranks as one of the most important long poems published in England since John Milton's Paradise Lost. The poem, often called the epic of its time, has roots deep in literary tradition and, although regarded by early Victorians as somewhat shocking, equally involves itself with its own contemporary world at all levels – social, political, literary and ideological. In addition to its biting satire, the poem (especially in the early cantos) is funny. Byron published the first two cantos anonymously in 1819 after disputes with his regular publisher over the shocking nature of the poetry; by this time, he had been a famous poet for seven years, and when he self-published the beginning cantos, they were well received in some quarters. It was then released volume by volume through his regular publishing house. By 1822, cautious acceptance by the public had turned to outrage, and Byron's publisher refused to continue to publish the works. In Canto III of Don Juan, Byron expresses his detestation for poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In letters to Francis Hodgson, Byron referred to Wordsworth as \"Turdsworth\".\nByron was a bitter opponent of Lord Elgin's removal of the Parthenon marbles from Greece, and \"reacted with fury\" when Elgin's agent gave him a tour of the Parthenon, during which he saw the spaces left by the missing friezes and metopes. He denounced Elgin's actions in his poem The Curse of Minerva and in Canto II (stanzas XI-XV) of ''Childe Harold's Pilgrimage.\nByron is considered to be the first modern-style celebrity. His image as the personification of the Byronic hero fascinated the public, and his wife Annabella coined the term \"Byromania\" to refer to the commotion surrounding him. His self-awareness and personal promotion are seen as a beginning to what would become the modern rock star; he would instruct artists painting portraits of him not to paint him with pen or book in hand, but as a \"man of action. \" While Byron first welcomed fame, he later turned from it by going into voluntary exile from Britain. The burning of Byron's memoir in the offices of his publisher John Murray a month after his death, and the suppression of details of Byron's bisexuality by subsequent heads of the firm (which held the richest Byron archive), distorted biographies. As late as the 1950s, scholar Leslie Marchard was expressly forbidden by the Murray company to reveal details of Byron's same-sex passions. The re-founding of the Byron Society in 1971 reflected the fascination that many people had with Byron and his work. This society became very active, publishing an annual journal. 36 Byron Societies function throughout the world, and an International Conference takes place annually. Byron exercised a marked influence on Continental literature and art, and his reputation as a poet is higher in many European countries than in Britain or America, although not as high as in his time, when he was widely thought to be the greatest poet in the world. Byron's writings also inspired many composers. Over forty operas have been based on his works, in addition to three operas about Byron himself (including Virgil Thomson's Lord Byron). His poetry was set to music by many Romantic composers, including Mendelssohn, Carl Loewe, and Robert Schumann. Among his greatest admirers was Hector Berlioz, whose operas and Mémoires reveal Byron's influence.\nThe figure of the Byronic hero pervades much of his work, and Byron himself is considered to epitomise many of the characteristics of this literary figure. Scholars have traced the literary history of the Byronic hero from John Milton, and many authors and artists of the Romantic movement show Byron's influence during the 19th century and beyond, including the Brontë sisters. His philosophy was more durably influential in continental Europe than in England; Friedrich Nietzsche admired him, and the Byronic hero was echoed in Nietzsche's superman. The Byronic hero presents an idealised, but flawed character whose attributes include: great talent; great passion; a distaste for society and social institutions; a lack of respect for rank and privilege (although possessing both); being thwarted in love by social constraint or death; rebellion; exile; an unsavory secret past; arrogance; overconfidence or lack of foresight; and, ultimately, a self-destructive manner. These types of characters have since become ubiquitous in literature and politics.\n","“SHE said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,” cried\nthe young Student; “but in all my garden there is no red rose.”\n\nFrom her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she\nlooked out through the leaves, and wondered.\n\n“No red rose in all my garden!” he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled\nwith tears.  “Ah, on what little things does happiness depend!  I have\nread all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of\nphilosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made\nwretched.”\n\n“Here at last is a true lover,” said the Nightingale.  “Night after night\nhave I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told\nhis story to the stars, and now I see him.  His hair is dark as the\nhyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but\npassion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal\nupon his brow.”\n\n“The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,” murmured the young Student,\n“and my love will be of the company.  If I bring her a red rose she will\ndance with me till dawn.  If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in\nmy arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will\nbe clasped in mine.  But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall\nsit lonely, and she will pass me by.  She will have no heed of me, and my\nheart will break.”\n\n“Here indeed is the true lover,” said the Nightingale.  “What I sing of,\nhe suffers—what is joy to me, to him is pain.  Surely Love is a wonderful\nthing.  It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.\nPearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the\nmarketplace.  It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be\nweighed out in the balance for gold.”\n\n“The musicians will sit in their gallery,” said the young Student, “and\nplay upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound\nof the harp and the violin.  She will dance so lightly that her feet will\nnot touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng\nround her.  But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to\ngive her”; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in\nhis hands, and wept.\n\n“Why is he weeping?” asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with\nhis tail in the air.\n\n“Why, indeed?” said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a\nsunbeam.\n\n“Why, indeed?” whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.\n\n“He is weeping for a red rose,” said the Nightingale.\n\n“For a red rose?” they cried; “how very ridiculous!” and the little\nLizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.\n\nBut the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student’s sorrow, and\nshe sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.\n\nSuddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.\nShe passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed\nacross the garden.\n\nIn the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and\nwhen she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.\n\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\n\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\n“My roses are white,” it answered; “as white as the foam of the sea, and\nwhiter than the snow upon the mountain.  But go to my brother who grows\nround the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.”\n\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the\nold sun-dial.\n\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\n\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\n“My roses are yellow,” it answered; “as yellow as the hair of the\nmermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil\nthat blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.  But go\nto my brother who grows beneath the Student’s window, and perhaps he will\ngive you what you want.”\n\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath\nthe Student’s window.\n\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\n\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\n“My roses are red,” it answered, “as red as the feet of the dove, and\nredder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the\nocean-cavern.  But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has\nnipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no\nroses at all this year.”\n\n“One red rose is all I want,” cried the Nightingale, “only one red rose!\nIs there no way by which I can get it?”\n\n“There is a way,” answered the Tree; “but it is so terrible that I dare\nnot tell it to you.”\n\n“Tell it to me,” said the Nightingale, “I am not afraid.”\n\n“If you want a red rose,” said the Tree, “you must build it out of music\nby moonlight, and stain it with your own heart’s-blood.  You must sing to\nme with your breast against a thorn.  All night long you must sing to me,\nand the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into\nmy veins, and become mine.”\n\n“Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,” cried the Nightingale,\n“and Life is very dear to all.  It is pleasant to sit in the green wood,\nand to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot\nof pearl.  Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the\nbluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the\nhill.  Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird\ncompared to the heart of a man?”\n\nSo she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.  She\nswept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through\nthe grove.\n\nThe young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him,\nand the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.\n\n“Be happy,” cried the Nightingale, “be happy; you shall have your red\nrose.  I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my\nown heart’s-blood.  All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a\ntrue lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and\nmightier than Power, though he is mighty.  Flame-coloured are his wings,\nand coloured like flame is his body.  His lips are sweet as honey, and\nhis breath is like frankincense.”\n\nThe Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not\nunderstand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the\nthings that are written down in books.\n\nBut the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the\nlittle Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.\n\n“Sing me one last song,” he whispered; “I shall feel very lonely when you\nare gone.”\n\nSo the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water\nbubbling from a silver jar.\n\nWhen she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book\nand a lead-pencil out of his pocket.\n\n“She has form,” he said to himself, as he walked away through the\ngrove—“that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?  I am\nafraid not.  In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without\nany sincerity.  She would not sacrifice herself for others.  She thinks\nmerely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.  Still,\nit must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.  What\na pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.”\nAnd he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and\nbegan to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.\n\nAnd when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the\nRose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.  All night long she sang\nwith her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down\nand listened.  All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and\ndeeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.\n\nShe sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.\nAnd on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous\nrose, petal following petal, as song followed song.  Pale was it, at\nfirst, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the\nmorning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.  As the shadow of a rose in\na mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the\nrose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.\n\nBut the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.\n“Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day will come\nbefore the rose is finished.”\n\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and\nlouder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of\na man and a maid.\n\nAnd a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the\nflush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.\nBut the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose’s heart remained\nwhite, for only a Nightingale’s heart’s-blood can crimson the heart of a\nrose.\n\nAnd the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.\n“Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day will come\nbefore the rose is finished.”\n\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn\ntouched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.  Bitter,\nbitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of\nthe Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the\ntomb.\n\nAnd the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.\nCrimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.\n\nBut the Nightingale’s voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to\nbeat, and a film came over her eyes.  Fainter and fainter grew her song,\nand she felt something choking her in her throat.\n\nThen she gave one last burst of music.  The white Moon heard it, and she\nforgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.  The red rose heard it, and\nit trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold\nmorning air.  Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke\nthe sleeping shepherds from their dreams.  It floated through the reeds\nof the river, and they carried its message to the sea.\n\n“Look, look!” cried the Tree, “the rose is finished now”; but the\nNightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass,\nwith the thorn in her heart.\n\nAnd at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.\n\n“Why, what a wonderful piece of luck!” he cried; “here is a red rose!  I\nhave never seen any rose like it in all my life.  It is so beautiful that\nI am sure it has a long Latin name”; and he leaned down and plucked it.\n\nThen he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor’s house with the rose\nin his hand.\n\nThe daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue\nsilk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.\n\n“You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,”\ncried the Student.  “Here is the reddest rose in all the world.  You will\nwear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell\nyou how I love you.”\n\nBut the girl frowned.\n\n“I am afraid it will not go with my dress,” she answered; “and, besides,\nthe Chamberlain’s nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody\nknows that jewels cost far more than flowers.”\n\n“Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,” said the Student angrily;\nand he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and\na cart-wheel went over it.\n\n“Ungrateful!” said the girl.  “I tell you what, you are very rude; and,\nafter all, who are you?  Only a Student.  Why, I don’t believe you have\neven got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain’s nephew has”;\nand she got up from her chair and went into the house.\n\n“What a silly thing Love is,” said the Student as he walked away.  “It\nis not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is\nalways telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one\nbelieve things that are not true.  In fact, it is quite unpractical, and,\nas in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to\nPhilosophy and study Metaphysics.”\n\nSo he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began\nto read.\n\n","Hey! Babe! Aren’t you excited we’re going on our honeymoon?\nYeah I am!\nBermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama…\nThat’s right. Get it out of your system while we’re alone.\nHey!\nYeah!

Where is it?\nOh no, I know I couldn’t see it either at first, but it’s right umm… Ross, I lost it again.\nOh.\n","I will now play the Oedipus to the Rattleborough enigma. I will expound\nto you--as I alone can--the secret of the enginery that effected the\nRattleborough miracle--the one, the true, the admitted, the undisputed,\nthe indisputable miracle, which put a definite end to infidelity among\nthe Rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the grandames all\nthe carnal-minded who had ventured to be sceptical before.\n\nThis event--which I should be sorry to discuss in a tone of unsuitable\nlevity--occurred in the summer of 18--. Mr. Barnabas Shuttleworthy--one\nof the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of the borough--had\nbeen missing for several days under circumstances which gave rise to\nsuspicion of foul play. Mr. Shuttleworthy had set out from Rattleborough\nvery early one Saturday morning, on horseback, with the avowed intention\nof proceeding to the city of-, about fifteen miles distant, and of\nreturning the night of the same day. Two hours after his departure,\nhowever, his horse returned without him, and without the saddle-bags\nwhich had been strapped on his back at starting. The animal was wounded,\ntoo, and covered with mud. These circumstances naturally gave rise to\nmuch alarm among the friends of the missing man; and when it was found,\non Sunday morning, that he had not yet made his appearance, the whole\nborough arose en masse to go and look for his body.\n\nThe foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom\nfriend of Mr. Shuttleworthy--a Mr. Charles Goodfellow, or, as he was\nuniversally called, “Charley Goodfellow,” or “Old Charley Goodfellow.”\n Now, whether it is a marvellous coincidence, or whether it is that the\nname itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character, I have never\nyet been able to ascertain; but the fact is unquestionable, that there\nnever yet was any person named Charles who was not an open, manly,\nhonest, good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear\nvoice, that did you good to hear it, and an eye that looked you always\nstraight in the face, as much as to say: “I have a clear conscience\nmyself, am afraid of no man, and am altogether above doing a mean\naction.” And thus all the hearty, careless, “walking gentlemen” of the\nstage are very certain to be called Charles.\n\nNow, “Old Charley Goodfellow,” although he had been in Rattleborough\nnot longer than six months or thereabouts, and although nobody knew\nany thing about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood, had\nexperienced no difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all\nthe respectable people in the borough. Not a man of them but would have\ntaken his bare word for a thousand at any moment; and as for the women,\nthere is no saying what they would not have done to oblige him. And all\nthis came of his having been christened Charles, and of his possessing,\nin consequence, that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very “best\nletter of recommendation.”\n\nI have already said that Mr. Shuttleworthy was one of the most\nrespectable and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in\nRattleborough, while “Old Charley Goodfellow” was upon as intimate terms\nwith him as if he had been his own brother. The two old gentlemen were\nnext-door neighbours, and, although Mr. Shuttleworthy seldom, if ever,\nvisited “Old Charley,” and never was known to take a meal in his house,\nstill this did not prevent the two friends from being exceedingly\nintimate, as I have just observed; for “Old Charley” never let a day\npass without stepping in three or four times to see how his neighbour\ncame on, and very often he would stay to breakfast or tea, and almost\nalways to dinner, and then the amount of wine that was made way with by\nthe two cronies at a sitting, it would really be a difficult thing to\nascertain. “Old Charleys” favorite beverage was Chateau-Margaux, and\nit appeared to do Mr. Shuttleworthy’s heart good to see the old fellow\nswallow it, as he did, quart after quart; so that, one day, when the\nwine was in and the wit as a natural consequence, somewhat out, he said\nto his crony, as he slapped him upon the back--“I tell you what it is,\n‘Old Charley,’ you are, by all odds, the heartiest old fellow I ever\ncame across in all my born days; and, since you love to guzzle the wine\nat that fashion, I’ll be darned if I don’t have to make thee a present\nof a big box of the Chateau-Margaux. Od rot me,”--(Mr. Shuttleworthy had\na sad habit of swearing, although he seldom went beyond “Od rot me,” or\n“By gosh,” or “By the jolly golly,”)--“Od rot me,” says he, “if I don’t\nsend an order to town this very afternoon for a double box of the best\nthat can be got, and I’ll make ye a present of it, I will!--ye needn’t\nsay a word now--I will, I tell ye, and there’s an end of it; so look out\nfor it--it will come to hand some of these fine days, precisely when ye\nare looking for it the least!” I mention this little bit of liberality\non the part of Mr. Shuttleworthy, just by way of showing you how very\nintimate an understanding existed between the two friends.\n\nWell, on the Sunday morning in question, when it came to be fairly\nunderstood that Mr. Shuttleworthy had met with foul play, I never saw\nany one so profoundly affected as “Old Charley Goodfellow.” When he\nfirst heard that the horse had come home without his master, and without\nhis master’s saddle-bags, and all bloody from a pistol-shot, that had\ngone clean through and through the poor animal’s chest without quite\nkilling him; when he heard all this, he turned as pale as if the missing\nman had been his own dear brother or father, and shivered and shook all\nover as if he had had a fit of the ague.\n\nAt first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any\nthing at all, or to concert upon any plan of action; so that for a long\ntime he endeavored to dissuade Mr. Shuttleworthy’s other friends from\nmaking a stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile--say for\na week or two, or a month, or two--to see if something wouldn’t turn up,\nor if Mr. Shuttleworthy wouldn’t come in the natural way, and explain\nhis reasons for sending his horse on before. I dare say you have often\nobserved this disposition to temporize, or to procrastinate, in people\nwho are labouring under any very poignant sorrow. Their powers of mind\nseem to be rendered torpid, so that they have a horror of any thing like\naction, and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed\nand “nurse their grief,” as the old ladies express it--that is to say,\nruminate over the trouble.\n\nThe people of Rattleborough had, indeed, so high an opinion of the\nwisdom and discretion of “Old Charley,” that the greater part of them\nfelt disposed to agree with him, and not make a stir in the business\n“until something should turn up,” as the honest old gentleman worded\nit; and I believe that, after all this would have been the general\ndetermination, but for the very suspicious interference of Mr.\nShuttleworthy’s nephew, a young man of very dissipated habits,\nand otherwise of rather bad character. This nephew, whose name was\nPennifeather, would listen to nothing like reason in the matter of\n“lying quiet,” but insisted upon making immediate search for the “corpse\nof the murdered man.”--This was the expression he employed; and Mr.\nGoodfellow acutely remarked at the time, that it was “a singular\nexpression, to say no more.” This remark of ‘Old Charley’s,’ too, had\ngreat effect upon the crowd; and one of the party was heard to ask,\nvery impressively, “how it happened that young Mr. Pennifeather was so\nintimately cognizant of all the circumstances connected with his wealthy\nuncle’s disappearance, as to feel authorized to assert, distinctly\nand unequivocally, that his uncle was ‘a murdered man.’” Hereupon some\nlittle squibbing and bickering occurred among various members of\nthe crowd, and especially between “Old Charley” and Mr.\nPennifeather--although this latter occurrence was, indeed, by no means a\nnovelty, for no good will had subsisted between the parties for the\nlast three or four months; and matters had even gone so far that Mr.\nPennifeather had actually knocked down his uncles friend for some\nalleged excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle’s\nhouse, of which the nephew was an inmate. Upon this occasion “Old\nCharley” is said to have behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian\ncharity. He arose from the blow, adjusted his clothes, and made no\nattempt at retaliation at all--merely muttering a few words about\n“taking summary vengeance at the first convenient opportunity,”--a\nnatural and very justifiable ebullition of anger, which meant nothing,\nhowever, and, beyond doubt, was no sooner given vent to than forgotten.\n\nHowever these matters may be (which have no reference to the point\nnow at issue), it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough,\nprincipally through the persuasion of Mr. Pennifeather, came at length\nto the determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search\nof the missing Mr. Shuttleworthy. I say they came to this determination\nin the first instance. After it had been fully resolved that a search\nshould be made, it was considered almost a matter of course that the\nseekers should disperse--that is to say, distribute themselves in\nparties--for the more thorough examination of the region round about. I\nforget, however, by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that\n“Old Charley” finally convinced the assembly that this was the most\ninjudicious plan that could be pursued. Convince them, however, he\ndid--all except Mr. Pennifeather, and, in the end, it was arranged that\na search should be instituted, carefully and very thoroughly, by the\nburghers en masse, “Old Charley” himself leading the way.\n\nAs for the matter of that, there could have been no better pioneer\nthan “Old Charley,” whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx;\nbut, although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and\ncorners, by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the\nneighbourhood, and although the search was incessantly kept up day and\nnight for nearly a week, still no trace of Mr. Shuttleworthy could be\ndiscovered. When I say no trace, however, I must not be understood to\nspeak literally, for trace, to some extent, there certainly was.\nThe poor gentleman had been tracked, by his horses shoes (which were\npeculiar), to a spot about three miles to the east of the borough,\non the main road leading to the city. Here the track made off into a\nby-path through a piece of woodland--the path coming out again into the\nmain road, and cutting off about half a mile of the regular distance.\nFollowing the shoe-marks down this lane, the party came at length to a\npool of stagnant water, half hidden by the brambles, to the right of the\nlane, and opposite this pool all vestige of the track was lost sight\nof. It appeared, however, that a struggle of some nature had here taken\nplace, and it seemed as if some large and heavy body, much larger and\nheavier than a man, had been drawn from the by-path to the pool. This\nlatter was carefully dragged twice, but nothing was found; and the party\nwas upon the point of going away, in despair of coming to any result,\nwhen Providence suggested to Mr. Goodfellow the expediency of draining\nthe water off altogether. This project was received with cheers,\nand many high compliments to “Old Charley” upon his sagacity and\nconsideration. As many of the burghers had brought spades with them,\nsupposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse,\nthe drain was easily and speedily effected; and no sooner was the\nbottom visible, than right in the middle of the mud that remained was\ndiscovered a black silk velvet waistcoat, which nearly every one\npresent immediately recognized as the property of Mr. Pennifeather. This\nwaistcoat was much torn and stained with blood, and there were several\npersons among the party who had a distinct remembrance of its having\nbeen worn by its owner on the very morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s\ndeparture for the city; while there were others, again, ready to testify\nupon oath, if required, that Mr. P. did not wear the garment in question\nat any period during the remainder of that memorable day, nor could\nany one be found to say that he had seen it upon Mr. P.’s person at any\nperiod at all subsequent to Mr. Shuttleworthy’s disappearance.\n\nMatters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr. Pennifeather, and it was\nobserved, as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were\nexcited against him, that he grew exceedingly pale, and when asked\nwhat he had to say for himself, was utterly incapable of saying a word.\nHereupon, the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him,\ndeserted him at once to a man, and were even more clamorous than his\nancient and avowed enemies for his instantaneous arrest. But, on the\nother hand, the magnanimity of Mr. Goodfellow shone forth with only the\nmore brilliant lustre through contrast. He made a warm and intensely\neloquent defence of Mr. Pennifeather, in which he alluded more than once\nto his own sincere forgiveness of that wild young gentleman--“the heir\nof the worthy Mr. Shuttleworthy,”--for the insult which he (the young\ngentleman) had, no doubt in the heat of passion, thought proper to put\nupon him (Mr. Goodfellow). “He forgave him for it,” he said, “from the\nvery bottom of his heart; and for himself (Mr. Goodfellow), so far from\npushing the suspicious circumstances to extremity, which he was sorry\nto say, really had arisen against Mr. Pennifeather, he (Mr. Goodfellow)\nwould make every exertion in his power, would employ all the little\neloquence in his possession to--to--to--soften down, as much as he could\nconscientiously do so, the worst features of this really exceedingly\nperplexing piece of business.”\n\nMr. Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain,\nvery much to the credit both of his head and of his heart; but your\nwarm-hearted people are seldom apposite in their observations--they run\ninto all sorts of blunders, contre-temps and mal apropos-isms, in the\nhot-headedness of their zeal to serve a friend--thus, often with the\nkindest intentions in the world, doing infinitely more to prejudice his\ncause than to advance it.\n\nSo, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of\n“Old Charley”; for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the\nsuspected, yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he\nuttered of which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the\nspeaker in the good opinion of his audience, had the effect to deepen\nthe suspicion already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded,\nand to arouse against him the fury of the mob.\n\nOne of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his\nallusion to the suspected as “the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr.\nShuttleworthy.” The people had really never thought of this before. They\nhad only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year\nor two previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the\nnephew), and they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance\nas a matter that was settled--so single-minded a race of beings were the\nRattleburghers; but the remark of “Old Charley” brought them at once to\na consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the possibility\nof the threats having been nothing more than a threat. And straightway\nhereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?--a question that\ntended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible crime upon\nthe young man. And here, lest I may be misunderstood, permit me to\ndigress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and\nsimple Latin phrase which I have employed, is invariably mistranslated\nand misconceived. “Cui bono?” in all the crack novels and elsewhere,--in\nthose of Mrs. Gore, for example, (the author of “Cecil,”) a lady who\nquotes all tongues from the Chaldaean to Chickasaw, and is helped to her\nlearning, “as needed,” upon a systematic plan, by Mr. Beckford,--in all\nthe crack novels, I say, from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of\nBulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth, the two little\nLatin words cui bono are rendered “to what purpose?” or, (as if quo\nbono,) “to what good.” Their true meaning, nevertheless, is “for whose\nadvantage.” Cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit. It is a purely\nlegal phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now\nunder consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges\nupon the probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to\nthat from the deed’s accomplishment. Now in the present instance, the\nquestion cui bono? very pointedly implicated Mr. Pennifeather. His\nuncle had threatened him, after making a will in his favour, with\ndisinheritance. But the threat had not been actually kept; the original\nwill, it appeared, had not been altered. Had it been altered, the only\nsupposable motive for murder on the part of the suspected would\nhave been the ordinary one of revenge; and even this would have been\ncounteracted by the hope of reinstation into the good graces of the\nuncle. But the will being unaltered, while the threat to alter remained\nsuspended over the nephew’s head, there appears at once the very\nstrongest possible inducement for the atrocity, and so concluded, very\nsagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle.\n\nMr. Pennifeather was, accordingly, arrested upon the spot, and the\ncrowd, after some further search, proceeded homeward, having him in\ncustody. On the route, however, another circumstance occurred tending to\nconfirm the suspicion entertained. Mr. Goodfellow, whose zeal led him\nto be always a little in advance of the party, was seen suddenly to run\nforward a few paces, stoop, and then apparently to pick up some small\nobject from the grass. Having quickly examined it he was observed, too,\nto make a sort of half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket; but\nthis action was noticed, as I say, and consequently prevented, when the\nobject picked up was found to be a Spanish knife which a dozen persons\nat once recognized as belonging to Mr. Pennifeather. Moreover, his\ninitials were engraved upon the handle. The blade of this knife was open\nand bloody.\n\nNo doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew, and immediately upon\nreaching Rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination.\n\nHere matters again took a most unfavourable turn. The prisoner, being\nquestioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s\ndisappearance, had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on\nthat very morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking, in the\nimmediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat\nhad been discovered through the sagacity of Mr. Goodfellow.\n\nThis latter now came forward, and, with tears in his eyes, asked\npermission to be examined. He said that a stern sense of the duty he\nowed his Maker, not less than his fellow-men, would permit him no longer\nto remain silent. Hitherto, the sincerest affection for the young man\n(notwithstanding the latter’s ill-treatment of himself, Mr. Goodfellow)\nhad induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could\nsuggest, by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious\nin the circumstances that told so seriously against Mr. Pennifeather,\nbut these circumstances were now altogether too convincing--too damning,\nhe would hesitate no longer--he would tell all he knew, although his\nheart (Mr. Goodfellow’s) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort.\nHe then went on to state that, on the afternoon of the day previous to\nMr. Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city, that worthy old gentleman\nhad mentioned to his nephew, in his hearing (Mr. Goodfellow’s), that\nhis object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an\nunusually large sum of money in the “Farmers and Mechanics’ Bank,” and\nthat, then and there, the said Mr. Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed\nto the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the\nwill originally made, and of cutting him off with a shilling. He (the\nwitness) now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what\nhe (the witness) had just stated was or was not the truth in every\nsubstantial particular. Much to the astonishment of every one present,\nMr. Pennifeather frankly admitted that it was.\n\nThe magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables\nto search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle. From\nthis search they almost immediately returned with the well-known\nsteel-bound, russet leather pocket-book which the old gentleman had been\nin the habit of carrying for years. Its valuable contents, however, had\nbeen abstracted, and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from\nthe prisoner the use which had been made of them, or the place of their\nconcealment. Indeed, he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter.\nThe constables, also, discovered, between the bed and sacking of the\nunhappy man, a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials\nof his name, and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim.\n\nAt this juncture, it was announced that the horse of the murdered man\nhad just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had\nreceived, and it was proposed by Mr. Goodfellow that a post mortem\nexamination of the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if\npossible, of discovering the ball. This was accordingly done; and, as\nif to demonstrate beyond a question the guilt of the accused, Mr.\nGoodfellow, after considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was\nenabled to detect and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size,\nwhich, upon trial, was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr.\nPennifeather’s rifle, while it was far too large for that of any other\nperson in the borough or its vicinity. To render the matter even surer\nyet, however, this bullet was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right\nangles to the usual suture, and upon examination, this seam corresponded\nprecisely with an accidental ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds\nacknowledged by the accused himself to be his own property. Upon finding\nof this bullet, the examining magistrate refused to listen to\nany farther testimony, and immediately committed the prisoner for\ntrial-declining resolutely to take any bail in the case, although\nagainst this severity Mr. Goodfellow very warmly remonstrated, and\noffered to become surety in whatever amount might be required. This\ngenerosity on the part of “Old Charley” was only in accordance with the\nwhole tenour of his amiable and chivalrous conduct during the entire\nperiod of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle. In the present instance\nthe worthy man was so entirely carried away by the excessive warmth of\nhis sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten, when he offered to\ngo bail for his young friend, that he himself (Mr. Goodfellow) did not\npossess a single dollar’s worth of property upon the face of the earth.\n\nThe result of the committal may be readily foreseen. Mr. Pennifeather,\namid the loud execrations of all Rattleborough, was brought to trial at\nthe next criminal sessions, when the chain of circumstantial evidence\n(strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts, which Mr.\nGoodfellow’s sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from\nthe court) was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive, that\nthe jury, without leaving their seats, returned an immediate verdict\nof “Guilty of murder in the first degree.” Soon afterward the unhappy\nwretch received sentence of death, and was remanded to the county jail\nto await the inexorable vengeance of the law.\n\nIn the meantime, the noble behavior of “Old Charley Goodfellow,” had\ndoubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough. He became\nten times a greater favorite than ever, and, as a natural result of the\nhospitality with which he was treated, he relaxed, as it were, perforce,\nthe extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto\nimpelled him to observe, and very frequently had little reunions at his\nown house, when wit and jollity reigned supreme-dampened a little, of\ncourse, by the occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy\nfate which impended over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of\nthe generous host.\n\nOne fine day, this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at\nthe receipt of the following letter:-\n\n Charles Goodfellow, Esq., Rattleborough\n From H.F.B. & Co.\n Chat. Mar. A--No. 1.--6 doz. bottles (1/2 Gross)\n\n “Charles Goodfellow, Esquire.\n\n “Dear Sir--In conformity with an order transmitted to our firm about\n two months since, by our esteemed correspondent, Mr. Barnabus\n Shuttleworthy, we have the honor of forwarding this morning, to your\n address, a double box of Chateau-Margaux of the antelope brand, violet\n seal. Box numbered and marked as per margin.\n\n “We remain, sir,\n         “Your most ob’nt ser’ts,\n                 “HOGGS, FROGS, BOGS, & CO.\n\n “City of--, June 21, 18--.\n\n “P.S.--The box will reach you by wagon, on the day after your receipt\n of this letter. Our respects to Mr. Shuttleworthy.\n\n                  “H., F., B., & CO.”\n\nThe fact is, that Mr. Goodfellow had, since the death of Mr.\nShuttleworthy, given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised\nChateau-Margaux; and he, therefore, looked upon it now as a sort\nof especial dispensation of Providence in his behalf. He was highly\ndelighted, of course, and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large\nparty of friends to a petit souper on the morrow, for the purpose of\nbroaching the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy’s present. Not that he said\nany thing about “the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy” when he issued the\ninvitations. The fact is, he thought much and concluded to say nothing\nat all. He did not mention to any one--if I remember aright--that he had\nreceived a present of Chateau-Margaux. He merely asked his friends to\ncome and help him drink some, of a remarkable fine quality and rich\nflavour, that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago,\nand of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow. I have often\npuzzled myself to imagine why it was that “Old Charley” came to the\nconclusion to say nothing about having received the wine from his\nold friend, but I could never precisely understand his reason for the\nsilence, although he had some excellent and very magnanimous reason, no\ndoubt.\n\nThe morrow at length arrived, and with it a very large and highly\nrespectable company at Mr. Goodfellow’s house. Indeed, half the borough\nwas there,--I myself among the number,--but, much to the vexation of the\nhost, the Chateau-Margaux did not arrive until a late hour, and when\nthe sumptuous supper supplied by “Old Charley” had been done very ample\njustice by the guests. It came at length, however,--a monstrously big\nbox of it there was, too--and as the whole party were in excessively\ngood humor, it was decided, nem. con., that it should be lifted upon the\ntable and its contents disembowelled forthwith.\n\nNo sooner said than done. I lent a helping hand; and, in a trice we had\nthe box upon the table, in the midst of all the bottles and glasses, not\na few of which were demolished in the scuffle. “Old Charley,” who was\npretty much intoxicated, and excessively red in the face, now took a\nseat, with an air of mock dignity, at the head of the board, and thumped\nfuriously upon it with a decanter, calling upon the company to keep\norder “during the ceremony of disinterring the treasure.”\n\nAfter some vociferation, quiet was at length fully restored, and, as\nvery often happens in similar cases, a profound and remarkable silence\nensued. Being then requested to force open the lid, I complied, of\ncourse, “with an infinite deal of pleasure.” I inserted a chisel, and\ngiving it a few slight taps with a hammer, the top of the box flew\nsuddenly off, and at the same instant, there sprang up into a sitting\nposition, directly facing the host, the bruised, bloody, and nearly\nputrid corpse of the murdered Mr. Shuttleworthy himself. It gazed for a\nfew seconds, fixedly and sorrowfully, with its decaying and lack-lustre\neyes, full into the countenance of Mr. Goodfellow; uttered slowly,\nbut clearly and impressively, the words--“Thou art the man!” and then,\nfalling over the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied, stretched\nout its limbs quiveringly upon the table.\n\nThe scene that ensued is altogether beyond description. The rush for the\ndoors and windows was terrific, and many of the most robust men in the\nroom fainted outright through sheer horror. But after the first wild,\nshrieking burst of affright, all eyes were directed to Mr. Goodfellow.\nIf I live a thousand years, I can never forget the more than mortal\nagony which was depicted in that ghastly face of his, so lately rubicund\nwith triumph and wine. For several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue\nof marble; his eyes seeming, in the intense vacancy of their gaze, to\nbe turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable,\nmurderous soul. At length their expression appeared to flash suddenly\nout into the external world, when, with a quick leap, he sprang from his\nchair, and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table,\nand in contact with the corpse, poured out rapidly and vehemently a\ndetailed confession of the hideous crime for which Mr. Pennifeather was\nthen imprisoned and doomed to die.\n\nWhat he recounted was in substance this:--He followed his victim to the\nvicinity of the pool; there shot his horse with a pistol; despatched\nits rider with the butt end; possessed himself of the pocket-book, and,\nsupposing the horse dead, dragged it with great labour to the\nbrambles by the pond. Upon his own beast he slung the corpse of Mr.\nShuttleworthy, and thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long\ndistance off through the woods.\n\nThe waistcoat, the knife, the pocket-book, and bullet, had been placed\nby himself where found, with the view of avenging himself upon Mr.\nPennifeather. He had also contrived the discovery of the stained\nhandkerchief and shirt.\n\nTowards the end of the blood-churning recital the words of the guilty\nwretch faltered and grew hollow. When the record was finally exhausted,\nhe arose, staggered backward from the table, and fell-dead.\n\n                   *****\n\nThe means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted, although\nefficient, were simple indeed. Mr. Goodfellow’s excess of frankness had\ndisgusted me, and excited my suspicions from the first. I was present\nwhen Mr. Pennifeather had struck him, and the fiendish expression which\nthen arose upon his countenance, although momentary, assured me that his\nthreat of vengeance would, if possible, be rigidly fulfilled. I was thus\nprepared to view the manoeuvering of “Old Charley” in a very different\nlight from that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of\nRattleborough. I saw at once that all the criminating discoveries arose,\neither directly or indirectly, from himself. But the fact which clearly\nopened my eyes to the true state of the case, was the affair of\nthe bullet, found by Mr. G. in the carcass of the horse. I had not\nforgotten, although the Rattleburghers had, that there was a hole where\nthe ball had entered the horse, and another where it went out. If it\nwere found in the animal then, after having made its exit, I saw clearly\nthat it must have been deposited by the person who found it. The bloody\nshirt and handkerchief confirmed the idea suggested by the bullet; for\nthe blood on examination proved to be capital claret, and no more.\nWhen I came to think of these things, and also of the late increase of\nliberality and expenditure on the part of Mr. Goodfellow, I entertained\na suspicion which was none the less strong because I kept it altogether\nto myself.\n\nIn the meantime, I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse\nof Mr. Shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as\ndivergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his\nparty. The result was that, after some days, I came across an old dry\nwell, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the\nbottom, I discovered what I sought.\n\nNow it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two\ncronies, when Mr. Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the\npromise of a box of Chateaux-Margaux. Upon this hint I acted. I procured\na stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse,\nand deposited the latter in an old wine box-taking care so to double\nthe body up as to double the whalebone with it. In this manner I had\nto press forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with\nnails; and I anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were\nremoved, the top would fly off and the body up.\n\nHaving thus arranged the box, I marked, numbered, and addressed it\nas already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine\nmerchants with whom Mr. Shuttleworthy dealt, I gave instructions to my\nservant to wheel the box to Mr. Goodfellow’s door, in a barrow, at a\ngiven signal from myself. For the words which I intended the corpse to\nspeak, I confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities; for their\neffect, I counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch.\n\nI believe there is nothing more to be explained. Mr. Pennifeather was\nreleased upon the spot, inherited the fortune of his uncle, profited by\nthe lessons of experience, turned over a new leaf, and led happily ever\nafterward a new life.\n\n","Thank you, thank you. Everybody, please be seated. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:\nLast month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq. Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought, and several thousand gave their lives. We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world.\nFor the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country. Most of al-Qaeda’s top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban’s momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home. These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness, and teamwork of America’s Armed Forces. At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They’re not consumed with personal ambition. They don’t obsess over their differences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together. Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example.\nThink about the America within our reach: a country that leads the world in educating its people. An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we’re in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded. We can do this. I know we can, because we’ve done it before. At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known.\nMy grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the chance to go to college on the G.I. Bill. My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth. The two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism. They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share – the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement.\nThe defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.\nWhat’s at stake aren't Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. And we have to reclaim them. Let’s remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren’t, and personal debt that kept piling up.\nIn 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn’t afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people’s money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn’t have the authority to stop the bad behavior. It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs, and we lost another four million before our policies were in full effect. Those are the facts. But so are these. In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs.\nLast year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late-1990s. Together, we’ve agreed to cut the deficit by more than two-trillion dollars. And we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again.\nThe state of our Union is getting stronger, and we’ve come too far to turn back now. As long as I’m President, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place.\nNo. We will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that’s built to last. An economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values.\nNow, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing. On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world’s number one automaker.\nChrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs. We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back.\nWhat’s happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. We can’t bring back every job that’s left our shores. But right now, it’s getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is more productive. A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for the first time in fifteen years, Master Lock’s unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.\nSo we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back. But we have to seize it. Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple: ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed.\nWe should start with our tax code. Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it.\nSo let’s change it. First, if you’re a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get a tax deduction for doing it. That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home.\nSecond, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here.\nThird, if you’re an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut. If you’re a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making products here. And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.\nMy message is simple. It’s time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I’ll sign them right away.\nWe’re also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years. With the bipartisan trade agreements I signed into law, we are on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule. Soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.\nI will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products. And I will not stand by when our competitors don’t play by the rules. We’ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration, and it’s made a difference. Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires. But we need to do more. It’s not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It’s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they’re heavily subsidized.\nTonight, I’m announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China. There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing finance or new markets like Russia. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you: America will always win.\nI also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but can’t find workers with the right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job. Think about that: openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work.\nThat’s inexcusable. And we know how to fix it.\nJackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic. Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College. The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training. It paid Jackie’s tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant.[1]\nI want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did. Join me in a national commitment to train two million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job. My Administration has already lined up more companies that want to help. Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, Orlando, and Louisville are up and running. Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers: places that teach people skills that local businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.\nAnd I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help they need. It’s time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work.\nThese reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier. For less than one-percent of what our Nation spends on education each year, we’ve convinced nearly every State in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning – the first time that’s happened in a generation. But challenges remain. And we know how to solve them.\nAt a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced States to lay off thousands of teachers. We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance. Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives. Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies, just to make a difference.\nTeachers matter. So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let’s offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones. In return, grant schools flexibility: to teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren’t helping kids learn. That's a bargain worth making.\nWe also know that when students aren’t allowed to walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma. When students are not allowed to drop out, they do better. So tonight, I call on every State to require that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn eighteen.\nWhen kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves middle-class families thousands of dollars. And give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years.\nOf course, it’s not enough for us to increase student aid. We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of money. States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down. Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who’ve done just that. Some schools re-design courses to help students finish more quickly. Some use better technology. The point is, it’s possible. So let me put colleges and universities on notice: if you can’t stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. Higher education can’t be a luxury. It’s an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.\nLet’s also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: the fact that they aren’t yet American citizens. Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation. Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else.\nThat doesn’t make sense.\nI believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration. That’s why my Administration has put more boots on the border than ever before. That’s why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office.\nThe opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let’s at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, and defend this country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away.\nYou see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country. That means women should earn equal pay for equal work. It means we should support everyone who’s willing to work; and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs.\nAfter all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses. So let’s pass an agenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year.\nInnovation also demands basic research. Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally-financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched. New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet. Don’t gut these investments in our budget. Don’t let other countries win the race for the future. Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries.\nNowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy. Over the last three years, we’ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m directing my Administration to open more than 75% of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. Right now, American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years. That’s right: eight years. Not only that: last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past sixteen years.\nBut with only two-percent of the world’s oil reserves, oil isn’t enough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy, a strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs.\nWe have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly one hundred years, and my Administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy. Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. And I’m requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.\nThe development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don’t have to choose between our environment and our economy. And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of thirty years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock, reminding us that Government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground.\nWhat’s true for natural gas is true for clean energy. In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world’s leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries. Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled. And thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.\nWhen Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance. But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan. Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts. Today, it’s hiring workers like Bryan, who said, “I’m proud to be working in the industry of the future.”[2]\nOur experience with shale gas shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don’t always come right away. Some technologies don’t pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. I will not walk away from workers like Bryan. I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here. We have subsidized oil companies for a century. That’s long enough. It’s time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that’s rarely been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that’s never been more promising. Pass clean energy tax credits and create these jobs.\nWe can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change. But there’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation. So far, you haven’t acted. Well tonight, I will. I’m directing my Administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power three million homes. And I’m proud to announce that the Department of Defense, the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history, with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year.\nOf course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. So here’s another proposal: help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings. Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, and more jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a bill that creates these jobs.\nBuilding this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure. So much of America needs to be rebuilt. We’ve got crumbling roads and bridges. A power grid that wastes too much energy. An incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world.\nDuring the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our States with a system of highways. Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today.\nIn the next few weeks, I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects. But you need to fund these projects. Take the money we’re no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home.\nThere’s never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest-hit when the housing bubble burst. Of course, construction workers weren’t the only ones hurt. So were millions of innocent Americans who’ve seen their home values decline. And while Government can’t fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.\nThat’s why I’m sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low interest rates. No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won’t add to the deficit, and will give banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust.\nLet’s never forget: millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a Government and a financial system that do the same. It’s time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: no bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.\nWe’ve all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn’t afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn’t afford them. That’s why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior. Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices don’t destroy the free market. They make the free market work better.\nThere is no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly. In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his. I’ve ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don’t make sense. We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than ten-billion dollars over the next five years. We got rid of one rule from forty years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill, because milk was somehow classified as an oil. With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.\nI’m confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder. But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago. I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury pollution, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean. I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny you coverage, or charge women differently from men.\nAnd I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules. The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system’s core purpose: getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, start a business, or send a kid to college.\nSo if you’re a big bank or financial institution, you are no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers’ deposits. You’re required to write out a “living will” that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you fail, because the rest of us aren’t bailing you out ever again. And if you’re a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they can’t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices are over. Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job: to look out for them.\nWe will also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments. Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there’s no real penalty for being a repeat offender. That’s bad for consumers, and it’s bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing. So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.\nAnd tonight, I am asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis. This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.\nA return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help us protect our people and our economy. But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future. Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160-million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile. People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year. There are plenty of ways to get this done. So let’s agree right here, right now: no side issues. No drama. Pass the payroll tax cut without delay.\nWhen it comes to the deficit, we’ve already agreed to more than two-trillion dollars in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means making choices. Right now, we’re poised to spend nearly a trillion dollars more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest two-percent of Americans. Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.\nDo we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else, like education and medical research, a strong military, and care for our veterans? Because if we’re serious about paying down our debt, we can’t do both.\nThe American people know what the right choice is. So do I. As I told the Speaker this summer, I’m prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors.\nBut in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of Members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes. Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule: if you make more than a million dollars a year, you should not pay less than 30% in taxes. And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires. In fact, if you’re earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98% of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up. You’re the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. You’re the ones who need relief.\nNow, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense.\nWe don’t begrudge financial success in this country. We admire it. When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it’s not because they envy the rich. It’s because they understand that when I get tax breaks I don’t need and the country can’t afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference – like a senior on a fixed income; or a student trying to get through school; or a family trying to make ends meet. That’s not right. Americans know it’s not right. They know that this generation’s success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to their country’s future, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility. That’s how we’ll reduce our deficit. That’s an America built to last.\nI recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt; energy and health care. But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right now: nothing will get done this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken. Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical?\nThe greatest blow to confidence in our economy last year didn’t come from events beyond our control. It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not. Who benefited from that fiasco?\nI’ve talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street. But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad, and it seems to get worse every year.\nSome of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics. So together, let’s take some steps to fix that. Send me a bill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress, and I will sign it tomorrow. Let’s limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact. Let’s make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can’t lobby Congress, and vice versa, an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington.\nSome of what’s broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days. A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything, even routine business, passed through the Senate. Neither party has been blameless in these tactics. Now both parties should put an end to it. For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days.\nThe executive branch also needs to change. Too often, it’s inefficient, outdated and remote. That’s why I’ve asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy so that our Government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people.\nFinally, none of these reforms can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town. We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common sense ideas.\nI’m a Democrat. But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: that Government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more. That’s why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and States. That’s why we’re getting rid of regulations that don’t work. That’s why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a Government program.\nOn the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about Government spending have supported federally-financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home.\nThe point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective Government. And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress. With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow. But I can do a whole lot more with your help. Because when we act together, there is nothing the United States of America can’t achieve.\nThat is the lesson we’ve learned from our actions abroad over the last few years. Ending the Iraq War has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies. From Pakistan to Yemen, the al-Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can’t escape the reach of the United States of America.\nFrom this position of strength, we’ve begun to wind down the War in Afghanistan. Ten thousand of our troops have come home. Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer. This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America.\nAs the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sana’a to Tripoli. A year ago, Gaddafi was one of the world’s longest-serving dictators, a murderer with American blood on his hands. Today, he is gone. And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change can’t be reversed, and that human dignity can’t be denied.\nHow this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain. But we have a huge stake in the outcome. And while it is ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well. We will stand against violence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings; men and women; Christians, Muslims, and Jews. We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.\nAnd we will safeguard America’s own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests. Look at Iran. Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran’s nuclear program now stands as one. The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent. Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal. But a peaceful resolution to this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.\nThe renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe. Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever. Our ties to the Americas are deeper. Our iron-clad commitment — and I mean ironclad — to Israel’s security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history. We’ve made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope. From the coalitions we’ve built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the blows we’ve dealt to our enemies, to the enduring power of our moral example: America is back.\nAnyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what they’re talking about. That’s not the message we get from leaders around the world, all of whom are eager to work with us. That’s not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin; from Cape Town to Rio; where opinions of America are higher than they’ve been in years. Yes, the world is changing; no, we can’t control every event. But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs, and as long as I’m President, I intend to keep it that way.\nThat’s why, working with our military leaders, I have proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget. To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I have already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing danger of cyber-threats.\nAbove all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it. As they come home, we must serve them as well as they served us. That includes giving them the care and benefits they have earned, which is why we’ve increased annual VA spending every year I’ve been President. And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our Nation.\nWith the bipartisan support of this Congress, we are providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets. Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families. And tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Job Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her.\nWhich brings me back to where I began. Those of us who’ve been sent here to serve can learn from the service of our troops. When you put on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re black or white; Asian or Latino; conservative or liberal; rich or poor; gay or straight. When you’re marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails. When you’re in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one Nation, leaving no one behind.\nOne of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden. On it are each of their names. Some may be Democrats. Some may be Republicans. But that doesn’t matter. Just like it didn’t matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates, a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary; and Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for president.\nAll that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about politics. No one thought about themselves. One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn’t deserve credit for the mission. It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job: the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs. More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other. Because you can’t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there’s someone behind you, watching your back.\nSo it is with America. Each time I look at that flag, I’m reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those fifty stars and those thirteen stripes. No one built this country on their own. This Nation is great because we built it together. This Nation is great because we worked as a team. This Nation is great because we get each other’s backs. And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great, no mission too hard. As long as we’re joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong.\nThank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.\n","The world has turned and left me here.\nJust where I was before you appeared, and in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face.\n\nI just made love with your sweet memory one thousand times in my head.\nYou said you loved it more than ever.\n\nYou remain turned away, turning further every day.\n\nI talked for hours to your wallet photograph and you just listened.\nYou laughed enchanted by intellect, or maybe you didn't.\n\nYou remain turned away, turning further every day.\n\n","Hey you guys!\nHey!\nHey, what are you doing?\nOh, figuring out our wedding plans.\nThat's funny, we were doing the same thing!\nYeah!\nIt's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea  how expensive this stuff was!\nYeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the  numbers.\nSo what did you two do about it?\nIt was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting  solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.\nThere's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact  that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.\nI heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.\nYeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.\nBut really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?\nAre you serious?\nYeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity  and we just got married at City Hall?\nI think it would make me wanna marry you even more.\nI've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!\nMaybe you do that next time you get married!\nNo, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. But  maybe the time after that!\nHey!\nHey!\nWhat's going on?\nOur adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning  the apartment.\nWe?\nYou know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!\nHey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?\nKind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.\nAnd it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about  us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.\nHey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very  impressive when the little people know a celebrity.\nLittle people?\nCelebrity.\nOk, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff  hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?\nWhat...? NO!\nChandler?\nI don't, and I'm offended  by the insinuation!\nOk, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes  taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?\nI'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not  mine.\nIt isn't mine!\nWell, I guess we'll never know whose  it is!\n \nMay I help you?\nYes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.\nWell, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.\nWell, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one\nWell, this is very generous!\nAnd we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.\nCompletely anonymous. From two kind strangers.\nMr. X and Phoebe Buffay.\nWell if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.\nNot necessary.\nBuffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.\nAnd \"X\" is spelled uhm... \"Mike Hannigan\".\nRight. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.\nSure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!\nIt does. It feels really good!\nOh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!\nOh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.\nMhm... it's moist.\nHi!\nHi! Emma will be up in a minute!\nOh, good!\nOh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.\nOh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists  out there.\nAbsolutely.\nThere was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under  a bridge!\nSo, uhm... what are you gonna do today?\nWell, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!\nOh my God, what!?\nLike I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and  fire!\nOk, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.\nBe-caaauuuse...\nAll right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing  incident... when I was little.\nSeriously?\nYes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden  my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut  a big chunk of my hair! And it was uneven for weeks!\nAnd you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you  in the movie!\nOk, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And  I was thinking Claire Danes.\nLook, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly  safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and  you'll see!\nRoss, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and  there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're  gonna return back to earth!\nSpace is filled with orbiting children. Look, please, just come  on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you  won’t regret it.\nAll right!\nGood, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their  irrational fears on their children, do you?\nIrrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next  time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!\nOh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different  species of poisonous swings!\nOh my God, the adoption lady is early!\nOk, ok, here we go.\nOk.\nHere we go. Stand up straight.\nHello, is this the creepy residence?\nWe’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad  you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…\nAwe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing  a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!\nI told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!\nNo, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money  we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.\nThat’s crazy! . I am sorry. I just can’t  imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!\nWe, you know, we’re different! We don’t care about having  a huge party. All right, well, who cares,  I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.\nThat’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s  the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?\nCity Hall.\nOw! Oh, that sounds nice! I am just  there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!\nIt’s ok, it’s ok. I made my decision. What I really want  is a great big wedding\nYay!\nBut you already gave all your money to charity!\nWell, I’ll just ask for it back!\nI don’t think you can do that!\nWhy not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some  stupid kids!\nThat’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.\nOk, careful.\nOk.\nCareful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!\nRach, she’s got like three hairs!\nI know but they’re just so beautiful!  Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.\nI promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.\nOk.\nReady sweety?\nOk.\nHere we go!\nOk, careful, ok. Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God,  she does like it!\nSee, I told you!\nAwe! Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil!  Oh, let me push, can I push?\nOh, absolutely!\nOk. Oh God. Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag.\nOk! Ow!\n \nWe’re seriously asking for our money back?\nIt’s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight,  because one of us gonna have to start flirting.\nWow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don’t  think that that’s ever happened before.\nGay, go.\nMike : Oh my God, I love your shirt!\nThe donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it  back.\nExcuse me?\nYeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t  want, but it turns out we do.\nSo you’re asking us to refund your donation to the children?\nYeah! This feels really good.\nI am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.\nHey, it’s not my business, besides it’s probably a good thing. We really would have been  spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing…\nHey, that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important!  And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t  go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an  escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me”  or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty  little man make me feel badly about it.\nShe could have been talking about either one of us.\nHi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.\nHi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.\nThank you!\nWould you like something to drink?\nOh, water would be fine.\nOk. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited  about getting this process started.\nOh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually  to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount...  as allowed by law.\nYour place is just lovely.\nAh, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.\nYou know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples  in the  building adopting?\nIs that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby  before  them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.\nBut other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.\nOh...\nWhat?\nI just realized why I remember this place.\nReally? What is it?\nOh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building  and it  didn't end very well.\nOhh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?\nYes!\nOf course it was!\nYeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he  would call  me and he didn't.\nRAT BASTARD!\nSo you're not friends with him?\nOH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no,  no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!\nWell, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning  on staying at  home with your child...\nOW!\nWhat was that?\nOh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great  with  kids though.\nOh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?\nSON OF A BITCH!\nRoss, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it.  That is  the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.\nNo! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault  and kind  of that kids fault. Who is still laughing.  Nice.\nRoss, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else  gets  hurt?\nNo wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing,  okay? And  you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.\nI know what this is all about... You've  always been  jealous of my hair.\nLook, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your  silly  fears.\nAlright fine. I'll do it.\nGood.\nIf you hold a spider.\nWHAT?  WHERE? WHERE?\nIF you hold a spider.\nI know.\nGuys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!\nWhat's going on?\nOh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.\nGuys!?\nKeep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!\nWhat's going on?\nWE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!\nEverything doesn't sound fine!\nIs he alright out there by himself?\nOh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.\nBert and Ernie!\nYou can't make this stuff up!\nYou never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm  sorry about  that.\nOh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.\nWell, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really  deserve that.\nYeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. Just like the kids I took the money from.\nNo! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.\nLook, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.\nAlright, fine. We'll give the money back.\nAnd if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't  shot  anyone in a really long time.\nWell, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child  in.\nOh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the  furniture,  because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!\nOh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything  I need  up to here...\nWhy don't I show you the baby's room?\nWhat the hell are you doing?\nWell, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.\nWell, we're not.\nBut you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!\nWe don't have a code word.\nWe don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word  for danger.\nSo that was the baby's room.\nWhat room should we see next?\nAny room that isn't behind this couch!\n.\nI did not care for that!\nYou have to get out of here. You slept  with  our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so  she can't  see you.\nOk, ok!\nOk!\nWhat?\nI forgot my bat.\nOh my God!\nAnd for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And  we don't want to buy your bat!\nWhat are you doing here?\nBert! Bert! Bert! Bert!\nAre you friends with him?\nI can explain... Joey...\nUhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back  here. I can't believe you never called me.\nExcuse me?\nOh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by  the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it...  lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.\nI gave you my number, you never called me.\nNo, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of...  social work, ok, that you can just... do.\nWell, I'm pretty sure I gave  you my number.\nReally? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny,  we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?\nI don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...\nNo, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You  know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you?\nJoey, wait!\nI'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...\nOh, that's really ok.\nYeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.\nBoy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going  to make excellent parents.\nLAURA!\nWe're back!\nAre you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're  looking for is an ATM.\nNo, no, we're here to give the money back.\nYeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.\nAlthough... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. No... Oh God... Oh!\nIf I haven't said so already sir,  congratulations!\nNow... what do you think we should do?\nYou know what? It's not your decision anymore.\nWhat?\nOn behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.\nBut... but... but we're giving you this!\nYeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it  a contribution.\nWell, this is very generous!\nPlease, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful  life together.\nWell, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come  back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.\nAbsolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.\nOh, is that you?\nNo!\nHello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler...  Ok, goodbye.\nWrong number?\nIt was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on  the waiting list.\nThat's great!\nNow we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's  a baby waiting for us. Oh...\nHello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?\nOk... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.\nOk...\nOk...\nThis feels perfectly normal. Ok,  get on the swing!\nOk... O-k...\nOk...\nwhoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!\nSee?\nA-alright! I can do this.\nThere you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used  to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.\nThat's because he's on your neck.\nWell... Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...\nROSS!\n","Article 901: Scope and Coverage\n1.

Article 105 (Extent of Obligations) does not apply to this Chapter.\n2. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure observance of Articles 904 through 908 by state or provincial governments and by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory.\nArticle 903: Affirmation of Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and Other Agreements\nFurther to Article 103 (Relation to Other Agreements), the Parties affirm with respect to each other their existing rights and obligations relating to standards-related measures under the GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and all other international agreements, including environmental and conservation agreements, to which those Parties are party.\nArticle 904: Basic Rights and Obligations\nRight to Take Standards-Related Measures\n1. Each Party may, in accordance with this Agreement, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure, including any such measure relating to safety, the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, and any measure to ensure its enforcement or implementation. Such measures include those to prohibit the importation of a good of another Party or the provision of a service by a service provider of another Party that fails to comply with the applicable requirements of those measures or to complete the Party's approval procedures.\nRight to Establish Level of Protection\n2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, each Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives of safety or the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, establish the levels of protection that it considers appropriate in accordance with Article 907(2).\nNon-Discriminatory Treatment\n3. Each Party shall, in respect of its standards-related measures, accord to goods and service providers of another Party:\n\n(a) national treatment in accordance with Article 301 (Market Access) or Article 1202 (Cross-Border Trade in Services); and\n(b) treatment no less favorable than that it accords to like goods, or in like circumstances to service providers, of any other country.\nUnnecessary Obstacles\n4. No Party may prepare, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure with a view to or with the effect of creating an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties. An unnecessary obstacle to trade shall not be deemed to be created where:\n\n(a) the demonstrable purpose of the measure is to achieve a legitimate objective; and\n(b) the measure does not operate to exclude goods of another Party that meet that legitimate objective.\nArticle 905: Use of International Standards\n1. Each Party shall use, as a basis for its standards-related measures, relevant international standards or international standards whose completion is imminent, except where such standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means to fulfill its legitimate objectives, for example because of fundamental climatic, geographical, technological or infrastructural factors, scientific justification or the level of protection that the Party considers appropriate.\n2. A Party's standards-related measure that conforms to an international standard shall be presumed to be consistent with Article 904(3) and (4).\n3. Nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, from adopting, maintaining or applying any standards-related measure that results in a higher level of protection than would be achieved if the measure were based on the relevant international standard.\nArticle 906: Compatibility and Equivalence\n1. Recognizing the crucial role of standards-related measures in achieving legitimate objectives, the Parties shall, in accordance with this Chapter, work jointly to enhance the level of safety and of protection of human, animal and plant life and health, the environment and consumers.\n2. Without reducing the level of safety or of protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, without prejudice to the rights of any Party under this Chapter, and taking into account international standardization activities, the Parties shall, to the greatest extent practicable, make compatible their respective standards-related measures, so as to facilitate trade in a good or service between the Parties.\n3. Further to Articles 902 and 905, a Party shall, on request of another Party, seek, through appropriate measures, to promote the compatibility of a specific standard or conformity assessment procedure that is maintained in its territory with the standards or conformity assessment procedures maintained in the territory of the other Party.\n4. Each importing Party shall treat a technical regulation adopted or maintained by an exporting Party as equivalent to its own where the exporting Party, in cooperation with the importing Party, demonstrates to the satisfaction of the importing Party that its technical regulation adequately fulfills the importing Party's legitimate objectives.\n5. The importing Party shall provide to the exporting Party, on request, its reasons in writing for not treating a technical regulation as equivalent under paragraph 4.\n6. Each Party shall, wherever possible, accept the results of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in the territory of another Party, provided that it is satisfied that the procedure offers an assurance, equivalent to that provided by a procedure it conducts or a procedure conducted in its territory the results of which it accepts, that the relevant good or service complies with the applicable technical regulation or standard adopted or maintained in the Party's territory.\n7. Prior to accepting the results of a conformity assessment procedure pursuant to paragraph 6, and to enhance confidence in the continued reliability of each other's conformity assessment results, the Parties may consult on such matters as the technical competence of the conformity assessment bodies involved, including verified compliance with relevant international standards through such means as accreditation.\nArticle 907: Assessment of Risk\n1. A Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, conduct an assessment of risk. In conducting an assessment, a Party may take into account, among other factors relating to a good or service:\n\n(a) available scientific evidence or technical information;\n(b) intended end uses;\n(c) processes or production, operating, inspection, sampling or testing methods; or\n(d) environmental conditions.\n2. Where pursuant to Article 904(2) a Party establishes a level of protection that it considers appropriate and conducts an assessment of risk, it should avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions between similar goods or services in the level of protection it considers appropriate, where the distinctions:\n\n(a) result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against goods or service providers of another Party;\n(b) constitute a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties; or\n(c) discriminate between similar goods or services for the same use under the same conditions that pose the same level of risk and provide similar benefits.\n3. Where a Party conducting an assessment of risk determines that available scientific evidence or other information is insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a provisional technical regulation on the basis of available relevant information. The Party shall, within a reasonable period after information sufficient to complete the assessment of risk is presented to it, complete its assessment, review and, where appropriate, revise the provisional technical regulation in the light of that assessment.\nArticle 908: Conformity Assessment\n1. The Parties shall, further to Article 906 and recognizing the existence of substantial differences in the structure, organization and operation of conformity assessment procedures in their respective territories, make compatible those procedures to the greatest extent practicable.\n2. Recognizing that it should be to the mutual advantage of the Parties concerned and except as set out in Annex 908.2, each Party shall accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize conformity assessment bodies in the territory of another Party on terms no less favorable than those accorded to conformity assessment bodies in its territory.\n3. Each Party shall, with respect to its conformity assessment procedures:\n\n(a) not adopt or maintain any such procedure that is stricter, nor apply the procedure more strictly, than necessary to give it confidence that a good or a service conforms with an applicable technical regulation or standard, taking into account the risks that non-conformity would create;\n(b) initiate and complete the procedure as expeditiously as possible;\n(c) in accordance with Article 904(3), undertake processing of applications in non-discriminatory order;\n(d) publish the normal processing period for each such procedure or communicate the anticipated processing period to an applicant on request;\n(e) ensure that the competent body\n\n(i) on receipt of an application, promptly examines the completeness of the documentation and informs the applicant in a precise and complete manner of any deficiency,\n(ii) transmits to the applicant as soon as possible the results of the conformity assessment procedure in a form that is precise and complete so that the applicant may take any necessary corrective action,\n(iii) where the application is deficient, proceeds as far as practicable with the procedure where the applicant so requests, and\n(iv) informs the applicant, on request, of the status of the application and the reasons for any delay;\n(f) limit the information the applicant is required to supply to that necessary to conduct the procedure and to determine appropriate fees;\n(g) accord confidential or proprietary information arising from, or supplied in connection with, the conduct of the procedure for a good of another Party or for a service provided by a person of another Party\n\n(i) the same treatment as that for a good of the Party or a service provided by a person of the Party, and\n(ii) in any event, treatment that protects an applicant's legitimate commercial interests to the extent provided under the Party's law;\n(h) ensure that any fee it imposes for conducting the procedure is no higher for a good of another Party or a service provider of another Party than is equitable in relation to any such fee imposed for its like goods or service providers or for like goods or service providers of any other country, taking into account communication, transportation and other related costs;\n(i) ensure that the location of facilities at which a conformity assessment procedure is conducted does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent;\n(j) limit the procedure, for a good or service modified subsequent to a determination that the good or service conforms to the applicable technical regulation or standard, to that necessary to determine that the good or service continues to conform to the technical regulation or standard; and\n(k) limit any requirement regarding samples of a good to that which is reasonable, and ensure that the selection of samples does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent.\n4. Each Party shall apply, with such modifications as may be necessary, the relevant provisions of paragraph 3 to its approval procedures.\n5. Each Party shall, on request of another Party, take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to facilitate access in its territory for conformity assessment activities.\n6. Each Party shall give sympathetic consideration to a request by another Party to negotiate agreements for the mutual recognition of the results of that other Party's conformity assessment procedures.\nArticle 909: Notification, Publication, and Provision of Information\n1. Further to Articles 1802 (Publication) and 1803 (Notification and Provision of Information), each Party proposing to adopt or modify a technical regulation shall:\n\n(a) at least 60 days prior to the adoption or modification of the measure, other than a law, publish a notice and notify in writing the other Parties of the proposed measure in such a manner as to enable interested persons to become acquainted with the proposed measure, except that in the case of any such measure relating to perishable goods, each Party shall, to the greatest extent practicable, publish the notice and provide the notification at least 30 days prior to the adoption or modification of the measure, but no later than when notification is provided to domestic producers;\n(b) identify in the notice and notification the good or service to which the measure would apply, and shall provide a brief description of the objective of, and reasons for the measure;\n(c) provide a copy of the proposed measure to any Party or interested person that so requests, and shall, wherever possible, identify any provision that deviates in substance from relevant international standards; and\n(d) without discrimination, allow other Parties and interested persons to make comments in writing and shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the comments and the results of the discussions into account.\n2. Each Party proposing to adopt or modify a standard or any conformity assessment procedure not otherwise considered to be a technical regulation shall, where an international standard relevant to the proposed measure does not exist or such measure is not substantially the same as an international standard, and where the measure may have a significant effect on the trade of the other Parties:\n\n(a) at an early appropriate stage, publish a notice and provide a notification of the type required in paragraph 1(a) and (b); and\n(b) observe paragraph (c) and (d).\n3. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure, with respect to a technical regulation of a state or provincial government other than a local government:\n\n(a) that, at an early appropriate stage, a notice and notification of the type required under paragraph 1(a) and (b) are made prior to their adoption; and\n(b) observance of paragraph (c) and (d).\n4. Where a Party considers it necessary to address an urgent problem relating to safety or to protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, it may omit any step set out in paragraph 1 or 3, provided that on adoption of a standards-related measure it shall:\n\n(a) immediately provide to the other Parties a notification of the type required under paragraph 1(b), including a brief description of the urgent problem;\n(b) provide a copy of the measure to any Party or interested person that so requests; and\n(c) without discrimination, allow other Parties and interested persons to make comments in writing, and shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the comments and the results of the discussions into account.\n5. Each Party shall, except where necessary to address an urgent problem referred to in paragraph 4, allow a reasonable period between the publication of a standards-related measure and the date that it becomes effective to allow time for interested persons to adapt to the measure.\n6. Where a Party allows non-governmental persons in its territory to be present during the process of development of standards-related measures, it shall also allow non-governmental persons from the territories of the other Parties to be present.\n7. Each Party shall notify the other Parties of the development of, amendment to, or change in the application of its standards-related measures no later than the time at which it notifies non-governmental persons in general or the relevant sector in its territory.\n8. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure the observance of paragraphs 6 and 7 by a state or provincial government, and by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory.\n9. Each Party shall designate by January 1, 1994 a government authority responsible for the implementation at the federal level of the notification provisions of this Article, and shall notify the other Parties thereof. Where a Party designates two or more government authorities for that purpose, it shall provide to the other Parties complete and unambiguous information on the scope of responsibility of each such authority.\nArticle 910: Inquiry Points\n1. Each Party shall ensure that there is an inquiry point that is able to answer all reasonable inquiries from other Parties and interested persons, and to provide relevant documents regarding:\n\n(a) any standards-related measure proposed, adopted or maintained in its territory at the federal, state or provincial government level;\n(b) the membership and participation of the Party, or its relevant federal, state or provincial government authorities, in international and regional standardizing bodies and conformity assessment systems, and in bilateral and multilateral arrangements regarding standards-related measures, and the provisions of those systems and arrangements;\n(c) the location of notices published pursuant to Article 909, or where the information can be obtained;\n(d) the location of the inquiry points referred to in paragraph 3; and\n(e) the Party's procedures for assessment of risk, and factors it considers in conducting the assessment and in establishing, pursuant to Article 904(2), the levels of protection that it considers appropriate.\n2. Where a Party designates more than one inquiry point, it shall:\n\n(a) provide to the other Parties complete and unambiguous information on the scope of responsibility of each inquiry point; and\n(b) ensure that any inquiry addressed to an incorrect inquiry point is promptly conveyed to the correct inquiry point.\n3. Each Party shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure that there is at least one inquiry point that is able to answer all reasonable inquiries from other Parties and interested persons and to provide relevant documents or information as to where they can be obtained regarding:\n\n(a) any standard or conformity assessment procedure proposed, adopted or maintained by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory; and\n(b) the membership and participation of relevant non-governmental bodies in its territory in international and regional standardizing bodies and conformity assessment systems.\n4. Each Party shall ensure that where copies of documents are requested by another Party or by interested persons in accordance with this Chapter, they are supplied at the same price, apart from the actual cost of delivery, as the price for domestic purchase.\nArticle 911: Technical Cooperation\n1. Each Party shall, on request of another Party:\n\n(a) provide to that Party technical advice, information and assistance on mutually agreed terms and conditions to enhance that Party's standards-related measures, and related activities, processes and systems;\n(b) provide to that Party information on its technical cooperation programs regarding standards-related measures relating to specific areas of interest; and\n(c) consult with that Party during the development of, or prior to the adoption or change in the application of, any standards-related measure.\n2. Each Party shall encourage standardizing bodies in its territory to cooperate with the standardizing bodies in the territories of the other Parties in their participation, as appropriate, in standardizing activities, such as through membership in international standardizing bodies.\nArticle 912: Limitations on the Provision of Information\nNothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a Party to:\n\n(a) communicate, publish texts, or provide particulars or copies of documents other than in an official language of the Party; or\n(b) furnish any information the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises.\nArticle 913: Committee on Standards-Related Measures\n1. The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Standards-Related Measures, comprising representatives of each Party.\n2.

The Committee shall:\n\n(a) meet on request of any Party and, unless the Parties otherwise agree, at least once each year; and\n(b) report annually to the Commission on the implementation of this Chapter.\n4. The Committee may, as it considers appropriate, establish and determine the scope and mandate of subcommittees or working groups, comprising representatives of each Party. Each subcommittee or working group may:\n\n(a) as it considers necessary or desirable, include or consult with\n\n(i) representatives of non-governmental bodies, including standardizing bodies,\n(ii) scientists, and\n(iii) technical experts; and\n(b) determine its work program, taking into account relevant international activities.\n5.

Where a Party requests consultations regarding the application of this Chapter to a standards-related measure, and so notifies the Committee, the Committee may facilitate the consultations, if it does not consider the matter itself, by referring the matter for non-binding technical advice or recommendations to a subcommittee or working group, including an ad hoc subcommittee or working group, or to another forum.\n2. The Committee should consider any matter referred to it under paragraph 1 as expeditiously as possible and promptly forward to the Parties any technical advice or recommendations that it develops or receives concerning the matter. The Parties involved shall provide a written response to the Committee concerning the technical advice or recommendations within such time as the Committee may request.\n3. Where the involved Parties have had recourse to consultations facilitated by the Committee under paragraph 1, the consultations shall, on the agreement of the Parties involved, constitute consultations under Article 2006 (Consultations).\n4.

Subject to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, disputes regarding any matter arising under both this Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , any agreement negotiated thereunder, or any successor agreement (GATT), may be settled in either forum at the discretion of the complaining Party.\n2. Before a Party initiates a dispute settlement proceeding in the GATT against another Party on grounds that are substantially equivalent to those available to that Party under this Agreement, that Party shall notify any third Party of its intention. If a third Party wishes to have recourse to dispute settlement procedures under this Agreement regarding the matter, it shall inform promptly the notifying Party and those Parties shall consult with a view to agreement on a single forum. If those Parties cannot agree, the dispute normally shall be settled under this Agreement.\n3. In any dispute referred to in paragraph 1 where the responding Party claims that its action is subject to Article 104 (Relation to Environmental and Conservation Agreements) and requests in writing that the matter be considered under this Agreement, the complaining Party may, in respect of that matter, thereafter have recourse to dispute settlement procedures solely under this Agreement.\n4.

On receipt of such request, the complaining Party shall promptly withdraw from participation in those proceedings and may initiate dispute settlement procedures under Article 2007.\n6. Once dispute settlement procedures have been initiated under Article 2007 or dispute settlement proceedings have been initiated under the GATT, the forum selected shall be used to the exclusion of the other, unless a Party makes a request pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4.\n7. For purposes of this Article, dispute settlement proceedings under the GATT are deemed to be initiated by a Party's request for a panel, such as under Article XXIII:2 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947 , or for a committee investigation, such as under Article 20.1 of the Customs Valuation Code.\nArticle 2006: Consultations\n1. Any Party may request in writing consultations with any other Party regarding any actual or proposed measure or any other matter that it considers might affect the operation of this Agreement.\n2.

About the second day out of school, I discovered some LSD at 9 AM in the morning. Whether I had eaten breakfast or not I don't remember, but i would guess NO. I was shocked looking at the two little green gel tabs, I put them in my mouth without hesitation and felt them disolve. OH WOW i thought before any of the effects kicked in, I just ate something that's going to make me trip for hours and hours seeing everything I've ever wanted to!\n\nHere I will give my previous drug experience:\nI had smoked endless amounts of pot just about every day starting about mid-junior year. I had eaten ecstacy about 5 times and I always felt uncomfortable getting an unnatural ecstatic emotion, and ecstacy is just bad for you, I say, and so does the evidence showing severe brain damage. Also at that point I had had one fun yet mild mushroom experience.\n\nI sat down at the computer to play an online game. I played about 15 minutes until the anticipation really kicked in. I started getting shaky and VERY ANXIOUS. I turned around and saw fishing poles in the corner of the room, they were taller than ever before and they towered over everything! At this point I figured I should go check things out, it's coming on. I got down on the floor and looked at my imitation oriental rug to see what was seen in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the pattern rose off the carpet, my eyes were really starting to play tricks on me.\n\nI need a shower. I get in the bathroom and the towels are breathing and pulsating, my vision was wacky. I could see small areas blown up very big and nothing other than my immediate vision. At this point I'm lost in my visuals and I'm in the shower feeling fucking great. I see a drop of water on the shower curtain and think, 'what would life be like inside a drop of water?'\n\nI'm out of the shower and decide to play my bass guitar. I put on Rage against the Machine's - Battle of LA. I am really feeling the music AND the the LSD...what a suprise! I'm softly inserting undertones on my bass, and I see the neck and strings all waving, up close, big, out of proportion, completely and utterly awesome! The anxiety is still there, STRONG, I'm trying to enjoy myself but the LSD is so freakin powerful!!!\n\nI start hearing audio hallucinations and at the same time visuals of lights turning on and off, plenty of color. The audio hallucinations sounded like the devil. Voices outside sounded like rumbling thunder. At this point I really need to talk to someone. I call my Mom at work. As soon as I start speaking I sound very loud and unusual, my Mom asks if I'm alright...what am I supposed to say, 'Well I'm on LSD!' No, that's not right.\n\nNow I REALLY need to leave my house or else the anxiety will drive me into a wall! I go outside with the phone and a cigarette. The side of my house looked like it was expanding in the upwards and downwards directions. I get in touch with my friend, who I'll call N, and I go to his house down the street to meet him and another friend A, whom were and are two of my best friends.\n\nWhen I get there I'm talking very loud and I say I think I've eaten some LSD. After a while, it is abundantly clear to them that I have. They stick by me and keep me relaxed. We drive over to a friend's house I'll call E, another best, and he has a friend chillin there. I wasn't feeling too high at this point, but everything on my mind was affecting me.\n\nI call my Mom again to talk, I tell her what happened, and she wants me home immediately. This was something I had to struggle with, I didn't wanna go home I'm out enjoying a high what good would coming home be if i'm going to get in trouble??? I decided to stay out and told my parents I would be safe and home later that evening.\n\nI go have a quality conversation with my friend A. He is a very experienced tripper of LSD and he comforts while we talk about jokes or funny experiences while the other people are out somewhere. They get back and I go for a ride with my friend N, we talk and I tell him how horrible the situation I'm in is, and that I'm in trouble. He ensures me that he is there and will help me.\n\nWe get back to E's house and then another friend shows up, he wants to smoke. Five of us head down the street to another friend's house to smoke. We sit out back and smoke dank bud out of a bubbler. My high starts to come back a little but the plateau had worn off a while ago.\n\nMy thinking goes on auto-pilot. I would think about the ramifications and harmony that come about through conversation. I decided not to speak after my thoughts flew right past the conversation.\n\nI come around after taking a piss and declare that on this day I am fucked up! At this point I feel sober enough to talk. I start to relax and my anxiety goes away. The trip slowed down and I started coming back to baseline.\n\nI decide it would be good to go home around 5 PM. When I go home I see some more visuals, talk with my parents, and make ammends. Almost a year has passed now. Since that summer, in the way of drugs I've decided not to touch cocaine, not to take LSD, ecstacy, heroine, ect...be careful, especially of the big ones...i'm serious\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this and learned a few things...\n\n\nRetrospective:\nFrom my personal experience...\n\nEating LSD at 9 AM: expect a freaking trip (see above) ^^.\nGel Tabs are potent, handle with care. I ate some 2 hits of paper/blotter about 2 months later and it wasn't a quarter as strong.\n\nHave friends & people you love to be with. \n\n","ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.  He had\nbright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long\nbit of black india-rubber.  The little ducks were swimming about in the\npond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who\nwas pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand\non their heads in the water.\n\n“You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your\nheads,” she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them\nhow it was done.  But the little ducks paid no attention to her.  They\nwere so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in\nsociety at all.\n\n“What disobedient children!” cried the old Water-rat; “they really\ndeserve to be drowned.”\n\n“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, “every one must make a\nbeginning, and parents cannot be too patient.”\n\n“Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,” said the Water-rat;\n“I am not a family man.  In fact, I have never been married, and I never\nintend to be.  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much\nhigher.  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or\nrarer than a devoted friendship.”\n\n“And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?” asked a\nGreen Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard\nthe conversation.\n\n“Yes, that is just what I want to know,” said the Duck; and she swam away\nto the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her\nchildren a good example.\n\n“What a silly question!” cried the Water-rat.  “I should expect my\ndevoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.”\n\n“And what would you do in return?” said the little bird, swinging upon a\nsilver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.\n\n“I don’t understand you,” answered the Water-rat.\n\n“Let me tell you a story on the subject,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Is the story about me?” asked the Water-rat.  “If so, I will listen to\nit, for I am extremely fond of fiction.”\n\n“It is applicable to you,” answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and\nalighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.\n\n“Once upon a time,” said the Linnet, “there was an honest little fellow\nnamed Hans.”\n\n“Was he very distinguished?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“No,” answered the Linnet, “I don’t think he was distinguished at all,\nexcept for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.  He\nlived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his\ngarden.  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.\nSweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds’-purses, and\nFair-maids of France.  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac\nCrocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white.  Columbine and Ladysmock,\nMarjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil\nand the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the\nmonths went by, one flower taking another flower’s place, so that there\nwere always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.\n\n“Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all\nwas big Hugh the Miller.  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to\nlittle Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over\nthe wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or\nfilling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.\n\n“‘Real friends should have everything in common,’ the Miller used to say,\nand little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend\nwith such noble ideas.\n\n“Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich\nMiller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred\nsacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large\nflock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these\nthings, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the\nwonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true\nfriendship.\n\n“So little Hans worked away in his garden.  During the spring, the\nsummer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and\nhe had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good\ndeal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper\nbut a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  In the winter, also, he was\nextremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.\n\n“‘There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow\nlasts,’ the Miller used to say to his wife, ‘for when people are in\ntrouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.  That\nat least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.  So I\nshall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and\nhe will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make\nhim so happy.’\n\n“‘You are certainly very thoughtful about others,’ answered the Wife, as\nshe sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; ‘very\nthoughtful indeed.  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about\nfriendship.  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful\nthings as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear\na gold ring on his little finger.’\n\n“‘But could we not ask little Hans up here?’ said the Miller’s youngest\nson.  ‘If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and\nshow him my white rabbits.’\n\n“‘What a silly boy you are!’ cried the Miller; ‘I really don’t know what\nis the use of sending you to school.  You seem not to learn anything.\nWhy, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good\nsupper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is\na most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody’s nature.  I certainly\nwill not allow Hans’ nature to be spoiled.  I am his best friend, and I\nwill always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any\ntemptations.  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have\nsome flour on credit, and that I could not do.  Flour is one thing, and\nfriendship is another, and they should not be confused.  Why, the words\nare spelt differently, and mean quite different things.  Everybody can\nsee that.’\n\n“‘How well you talk!’ said the Miller’s Wife, pouring herself out a large\nglass of warm ale; ‘really I feel quite drowsy.  It is just like being in\nchurch.’\n\n“‘Lots of people act well,’ answered the Miller; ‘but very few people\ntalk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of\nthe two, and much the finer thing also’; and he looked sternly across the\ntable at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his\nhead down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.\nHowever, he was so young that you must excuse him.”\n\n“Is that the end of the story?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Certainly not,” answered the Linnet, “that is the beginning.”\n\n“Then you are quite behind the age,” said the Water-rat.  “Every good\nstory-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the\nbeginning, and concludes with the middle.  That is the new method.  I\nheard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the\npond with a young man.  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am\nsure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head,\nand whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered ‘Pooh!’\nBut pray go on with your story.  I like the Miller immensely.  I have all\nkinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy\nbetween us.”\n\n“Well,” said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, “as\nsoon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale\nyellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see\nlittle Hans.\n\n“‘Why, what a good heart you have!’ cried his Wife; ‘you are always\nthinking of others.  And mind you take the big basket with you for the\nflowers.’\n\n“So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron\nchain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.\n\n“‘Good morning, little Hans,’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Good morning,’ said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to\near.\n\n“‘And how have you been all the winter?’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ cried Hans, ‘it is very good of you to ask, very good\nindeed.  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring\nhas come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.’\n\n“‘We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘and\nwondered how you were getting on.’\n\n“‘That was kind of you,’ said Hans; ‘I was half afraid you had forgotten\nme.’\n\n“‘Hans, I am surprised at you,’ said the Miller; ‘friendship never\nforgets.  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don’t\nunderstand the poetry of life.  How lovely your primroses are looking,\nby-the-bye!”\n\n“‘They are certainly very lovely,’ said Hans, ‘and it is a most lucky\nthing for me that I have so many.  I am going to bring them into the\nmarket and sell them to the Burgomaster’s daughter, and buy back my\nwheelbarrow with the money.’\n\n“‘Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don’t mean to say you have sold it?\nWhat a very stupid thing to do!’\n\n“‘Well, the fact is,’ said Hans, ‘that I was obliged to.  You see the\nwinter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to\nbuy bread with.  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat,\nand then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last\nI sold my wheelbarrow.  But I am going to buy them all back again now.’\n\n“‘Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘I will give you my wheelbarrow.  It is not in\nvery good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong\nwith the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.  I\nknow it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me\nextremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the\nworld.  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and,\nbesides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.  Yes, you may set your\nmind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.’\n\n“‘Well, really, that is generous of you,’ said little Hans, and his funny\nround face glowed all over with pleasure.  ‘I can easily put it in\nrepair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.’\n\n“‘A plank of wood!’ said the Miller; ‘why, that is just what I want for\nthe roof of my barn.  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will\nall get damp if I don’t stop it up.  How lucky you mentioned it!  It is\nquite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.  I have given\nyou my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.  Of\ncourse, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true,\nfriendship never notices things like that.  Pray get it at once, and I\nwill set to work at my barn this very day.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the\nplank out.\n\n“‘It is not a very big plank,’ said the Miller, looking at it, ‘and I am\nafraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won’t be any left for\nyou to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault.\nAnd now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to\ngive me some flowers in return.  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it\nquite full.’\n\n“‘Quite full?’ said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a\nvery big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no\nflowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver\nbuttons back.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘as I have given you my\nwheelbarrow, I don’t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.\nI may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true\nfriendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.’\n\n“‘My dear friend, my best friend,’ cried little Hans, ‘you are welcome to\nall the flowers in my garden.  I would much sooner have your good opinion\nthan my silver buttons, any day’; and he ran and plucked all his pretty\nprimroses, and filled the Miller’s basket.\n\n“‘Good-bye, little Hans,’ said the Miller, as he went up the hill with\nthe plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.\n\n“‘Good-bye,’ said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he\nwas so pleased about the wheelbarrow.\n\n“The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when\nhe heard the Miller’s voice calling to him from the road.  So he jumped\noff the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.\n\n“There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘would you mind carrying this sack\nof flour for me to market?’\n\n“‘Oh, I am so sorry,’ said Hans, ‘but I am really very busy to-day.  I\nhave got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all\nmy grass to roll.’\n\n“‘Well, really,’ said the Miller, ‘I think that, considering that I am\ngoing to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to\nrefuse.’\n\n“‘Oh, don’t say that,’ cried little Hans, ‘I wouldn’t be unfriendly for\nthe whole world’; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big\nsack on his shoulders.\n\n“It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans\nhad reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down\nand rest.  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the\nmarket.  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour\nfor a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was\nafraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.\n\n“‘It has certainly been a hard day,’ said little Hans to himself as he\nwas going to bed, ‘but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is\nmy best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.’\n\n“Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his\nsack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.\n\n“‘Upon my word,’ said the Miller, ‘you are very lazy.  Really,\nconsidering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might\nwork harder.  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don’t like any of\nmy friends to be idle or sluggish.  You must not mind my speaking quite\nplainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not\nyour friend.  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say\nexactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to\nplease and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things,\nand does not mind giving pain.  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he\nprefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off\nhis night-cap, ‘but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for\na little time, and listen to the birds singing.  Do you know that I\nalways work better after hearing the birds sing?’\n\n“‘Well, I am glad of that,’ said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the\nback, ‘for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed,\nand mend my barn-roof for me.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his\nflowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse\nthe Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.\n\n“‘Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?’ he\ninquired in a shy and timid voice.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘I do not think it is much to ask\nof you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of\ncourse if you refuse I will go and do it myself.’\n\n“‘Oh! on no account,’ cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and\ndressed himself, and went up to the barn.\n\n“He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came\nto see how he was getting on.\n\n“‘Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?’ cried the\nMiller in a cheery voice.\n\n“‘It is quite mended,’ answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.\n\n“‘Ah!’ said the Miller, ‘there is no work so delightful as the work one\ndoes for others.’\n\n“‘It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,’ answered little\nHans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, ‘a very great privilege.\nBut I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.’\n\n“‘Oh! they will come to you,’ said the Miller, ‘but you must take more\npains.  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you\nwill have the theory also.’\n\n“‘Do you really think I shall?’ asked little Hans.\n\n“‘I have no doubt of it,’ answered the Miller, ‘but now that you have\nmended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive\nmy sheep to the mountain to-morrow.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next\nmorning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans\nstarted off with them to the mountain.  It took him the whole day to get\nthere and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to\nsleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.\n\n“‘What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,’ he said, and he went\nto work at once.\n\n“But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his\nfriend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long\nerrands, or getting him to help at the mill.  Little Hans was very much\ndistressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had\nforgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller\nwas his best friend.  ‘Besides,’ he used to say, ‘he is going to give me\nhis wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.’\n\n“So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds\nof beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a\nnote-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good\nscholar.\n\n“Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside\nwhen a loud rap came at the door.  It was a very wild night, and the wind\nwas blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he\nthought it was merely the storm.  But a second rap came, and then a\nthird, louder than any of the others.\n\n“‘It is some poor traveller,’ said little Hans to himself, and he ran to\nthe door.\n\n“There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the\nother.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ cried the Miller, ‘I am in great trouble.  My little\nboy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the\nDoctor.  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it\nhas just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead\nof me.  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is\nonly fair that you should do something for me in return.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, ‘I take it quite as a compliment your\ncoming to me, and I will start off at once.  But you must lend me your\nlantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the\nditch.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ answered the Miller, ‘but it is my new lantern, and\nit would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.’\n\n“‘Well, never mind, I will do without it,’ cried little Hans, and he took\ndown his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler\nround his throat, and started off.\n\n“What a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans\ncould hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely\nstand.  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking\nabout three hours, he arrived at the Doctor’s house, and knocked at the\ndoor.\n\n“‘Who is there?’ cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom\nwindow.\n\n“‘Little Hans, Doctor.’\n\n“’What do you want, little Hans?’\n\n“‘The Miller’s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and\nthe Miller wants you to come at once.’\n\n“‘All right!’ said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big\nboots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the\ndirection of the Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him.\n\n“But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and\nlittle Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.\nAt last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very\ndangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans\nwas drowned.  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating\nin a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.\n\n“Everybody went to little Hans’ funeral, as he was so popular, and the\nMiller was the chief mourner.\n\n“‘As I was his best friend,’ said the Miller, ‘it is only fair that I\nshould have the best place’; so he walked at the head of the procession\nin a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a\nbig pocket-handkerchief.\n\n“‘Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,’ said the\nBlacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated\ncomfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.\n\n“‘A great loss to me at any rate,’ answered the Miller; ‘why, I had as\ngood as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don’t know what to do\nwith it.  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair\nthat I could not get anything for it if I sold it.  I will certainly take\ncare not to give away anything again.  One always suffers for being\ngenerous.’”\n\n“Well?” said the Water-rat, after a long pause.\n\n“Well, that is the end,” said the Linnet.\n\n“But what became of the Miller?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Oh!  I really don’t know,” replied the Linnet; “and I am sure that I\ndon’t care.”\n\n“It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,” said\nthe Water-rat.\n\n“I am afraid you don’t quite see the moral of the story,” remarked the\nLinnet.\n\n“The what?” screamed the Water-rat.\n\n“The moral.”\n\n“Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?”\n\n“Certainly,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Well, really,” said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, “I think you\nshould have told me that before you began.  If you had done so, I\ncertainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said\n‘Pooh,’ like the critic.  However, I can say it now”; so he shouted out\n“Pooh” at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back\ninto his hole.\n\n“And how do you like the Water-rat?” asked the Duck, who came paddling up\nsome minutes afterwards.  “He has a great many good points, but for my\nown part I have a mother’s feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed\nbachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.”\n\n“I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,” answered the Linnet.  “The\nfact is, that I told him a story with a moral.”\n\n“Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,” said the Duck.\n\nAnd I quite agree with her.\n\n","\n'Talking of Exhibitions, World's Fairs, and what not,' said the old\ngentleman, 'I would not go round the corner to see a dozen of them\nnowadays.  The only exhibition that ever made, or ever will make, any\nimpression upon my imagination was the first of the series, the parent of\nthem all, and now a thing of old times--the Great Exhibition of 1851, in\nHyde Park, London.  None of the younger generation can realize the sense\nof novelty it produced in us who were then in our prime.  A noun\nsubstantive went so far as to become an adjective in honour of the\noccasion.  It was \"exhibition\" hat, \"exhibition\" razor-strop,\n\"exhibition\" watch; nay, even \"exhibition\" weather, \"exhibition\" spirits,\nsweethearts, babies, wives--for the time.\n\n'For South Wessex, the year formed in many ways an extraordinary\nchronological frontier or transit-line, at which there occurred what one\nmight call a precipice in Time.  As in a geological \"fault,\" we had\npresented to us a sudden bringing of ancient and modern into absolute\ncontact, such as probably in no other single year since the Conquest was\never witnessed in this part of the country.'\n\nThese observations led us onward to talk of the different personages,\ngentle and simple, who lived and moved within our narrow and peaceful\nhorizon at that time; and of three people in particular, whose queer\nlittle history was oddly touched at points by the Exhibition, more\nconcerned with it than that of anybody else who dwelt in those outlying\nshades of the world, Stickleford, Mellstock, and Egdon.  First in\nprominence among these three came Wat Ollamoor--if that were his real\nname--whom the seniors in our party had known well.\n\nHe was a woman's man, they said,--supremely so--externally little else.\nTo men he was not attractive; perhaps a little repulsive at times.\nMusician, dandy, and company-man in practice; veterinary surgeon in\ntheory, he lodged awhile in Mellstock village, coming from nobody knew\nwhere; though some said his first appearance in this neighbourhood had\nbeen as fiddle-player in a show at Greenhill Fair.\n\nMany a worthy villager envied him his power over unsophisticated\nmaidenhood--a power which seemed sometimes to have a touch of the weird\nand wizardly in it.  Personally he was not ill-favoured, though rather un-\nEnglish, his complexion being a rich olive, his rank hair dark and rather\nclammy--made still clammier by secret ointments, which, when he came\nfresh to a party, caused him to smell like 'boys'-love' (southernwood)\nsteeped in lamp-oil.  On occasion he wore curls--a double row--running\nalmost horizontally around his head.  But as these were sometimes\nnoticeably absent, it was concluded that they were not altogether of\nNature's making.  By girls whose love for him had turned to hatred he had\nbeen nicknamed 'Mop,' from this abundance of hair, which was long enough\nto rest upon his shoulders; as time passed the name more and more\nprevailed.\n\nHis fiddling possibly had the most to do with the fascination he\nexercised, for, to speak fairly, it could claim for itself a most\npeculiar and personal quality, like that in a moving preacher.  There\nwere tones in it which bred the immediate conviction that indolence and\naverseness to systematic application were all that lay between 'Mop' and\nthe career of a second Paganini.\n\nWhile playing he invariably closed his eyes; using no notes, and, as it\nwere, allowing the violin to wander on at will into the most plaintive\npassages ever heard by rustic man.  There was a certain lingual character\nin the supplicatory expressions he produced, which would well nigh have\ndrawn an ache from the heart of a gate-post.  He could make any child in\nthe parish, who was at all sensitive to music, burst into tears in a few\nminutes by simply fiddling one of the old dance-tunes he almost entirely\naffected--country jigs, reels, and 'Favourite Quick Steps' of the last\ncentury--some mutilated remains of which even now reappear as nameless\nphantoms in new quadrilles and gallops, where they are recognized only by\nthe curious, or by such old-fashioned and far-between people as have been\nthrown with men like Wat Ollamoor in their early life.\n\nHis date was a little later than that of the old Mellstock quire-band\nwhich comprised the Dewys, Mail, and the rest--in fact, he did not rise\nabove the horizon thereabout till those well-known musicians were\ndisbanded as ecclesiastical functionaries.  In their honest love of\nthoroughness they despised the new man's style.  Theophilus Dewy (Reuben\nthe tranter's younger brother) used to say there was no 'plumness' in\nit--no bowing, no solidity--it was all fantastical.  And probably this\nwas true.  Anyhow, Mop had, very obviously, never bowed a note of church-\nmusic from his birth; he never once sat in the gallery of Mellstock\nchurch where the others had tuned their venerable psalmody so many\nhundreds of times; had never, in all likelihood, entered a church at all.\nAll were devil's tunes in his repertory.  'He could no more play the Wold\nHundredth to his true time than he could play the brazen serpent,' the\ntranter would say.  (The brazen serpent was supposed in Mellstock to be a\nmusical instrument particularly hard to blow.)\n\nOccasionally Mop could produce the aforesaid moving effect upon the souls\nof grown-up persons, especially young women of fragile and responsive\norganization.  Such an one was Car'line Aspent.  Though she was already\nengaged to be married before she met him, Car'line, of them all, was the\nmost influenced by Mop Ollamoor's heart-stealing melodies, to her\ndiscomfort, nay, positive pain and ultimate injury.  She was a pretty,\ninvocating, weak-mouthed girl, whose chief defect as a companion with her\nsex was a tendency to peevishness now and then.  At this time she was not\na resident in Mellstock parish where Mop lodged, but lived some miles off\nat Stickleford, farther down the river.\n\nHow and where she first made acquaintance with him and his fiddling is\nnot truly known, but the story was that it either began or was developed\non one spring evening, when, in passing through Lower Mellstock, she\nchanced to pause on the bridge near his house to rest herself, and\nlanguidly leaned over the parapet.  Mop was standing on his door-step, as\nwas his custom, spinning the insidious thread of semi- and\ndemi-semi-quavers from the E string of his fiddle for the benefit of\npassers-by, and laughing as the tears rolled down the cheeks of the\nlittle children hanging around him.  Car'line pretended to be engrossed\nwith the rippling of the stream under the arches, but in reality she was\nlistening, as he knew.  Presently the aching of the heart seized her\nsimultaneously with a wild desire to glide airily in the mazes of an\ninfinite dance.  To shake off the fascination she resolved to go on,\nalthough it would be necessary to pass him as he played.  On stealthily\nglancing ahead at the performer, she found to her relief that his eyes\nwere closed in abandonment to instrumentation, and she strode on boldly.\nBut when closer her step grew timid, her tread convulsed itself more and\nmore accordantly with the time of the melody, till she very nearly danced\nalong.  Gaining another glance at him when immediately opposite, she saw\nthat _one_ of his eyes was open, quizzing her as he smiled at her\nemotional state.  Her gait could not divest itself of its compelled\ncapers till she had gone a long way past the house; and Car'line was\nunable to shake off the strange infatuation for hours.\n\nAfter that day, whenever there was to be in the neighbourhood a dance to\nwhich she could get an invitation, and where Mop Ollamoor was to be the\nmusician, Car'line contrived to be present, though it sometimes involved\na walk of several miles; for he did not play so often in Stickleford as\nelsewhere.\n\nThe next evidences of his influence over her were singular enough, and it\nwould require a neurologist to fully explain them.  She would be sitting\nquietly, any evening after dark, in the house of her father, the parish\nclerk, which stood in the middle of Stickleford village street, this\nbeing the highroad between Lower Mellstock and Moreford, five miles\neastward.  Here, without a moment's warning, and in the midst of a\ngeneral conversation between her father, sister, and the young man before\nalluded to, who devotedly wooed her in ignorance of her infatuation, she\nwould start from her seat in the chimney-corner as if she had received a\ngalvanic shock, and spring convulsively towards the ceiling; then she\nwould burst into tears, and it was not till some half-hour had passed\nthat she grew calm as usual.  Her father, knowing her hysterical\ntendencies, was always excessively anxious about this trait in his\nyoungest girl, and feared the attack to be a species of epileptic fit.\nNot so her sister Julia.  Julia had found out what was the cause.  At the\nmoment before the jumping, only an exceptionally sensitive ear situated\nin the chimney-nook could have caught from down the flue the beat of a\nman's footstep along the highway without.  But it was in that footfall,\nfor which she had been waiting, that the origin of Car'line's involuntary\nspringing lay.  The pedestrian was Mop Ollamoor, as the girl well knew;\nbut his business that way was not to visit her; he sought another woman\nwhom he spoke of as his Intended, and who lived at Moreford, two miles\nfarther on.  On one, and only one, occasion did it happen that Car'line\ncould not control her utterance; it was when her sister alone chanced to\nbe present.  'Oh--oh--oh--!' she cried.  'He's going to _her_, and not\ncoming to _me_!'\n\nTo do the fiddler justice he had not at first thought greatly of, or\nspoken much to, this girl of impressionable mould.  But he had soon found\nout her secret, and could not resist a little by-play with her too easily\nhurt heart, as an interlude between his more serious performances at\nMoreford.  The two became well acquainted, though only by stealth, hardly\na soul in Stickleford except her sister, and her lover Ned Hipcroft,\nbeing aware of the attachment.  Her father disapproved of her coldness to\nNed; her sister, too, hoped she might get over this nervous passion for a\nman of whom so little was known.  The ultimate result was that Car'line's\nmanly and simple wooer Edward found his suit becoming practically\nhopeless.  He was a respectable mechanic, in a far sounder position than\nMop the nominal horse-doctor; but when, before leaving her, Ned put his\nflat and final question, would she marry him, then and there, now or\nnever, it was with little expectation of obtaining more than the negative\nshe gave him.  Though her father supported him and her sister supported\nhim, he could not play the fiddle so as to draw your soul out of your\nbody like a spider's thread, as Mop did, till you felt as limp as withy-\nwind and yearned for something to cling to.  Indeed, Hipcroft had not the\nslightest ear for music; could not sing two notes in tune, much less play\nthem.\n\nThe No he had expected and got from her, in spite of a preliminary\nencouragement, gave Ned a new start in life.  It had been uttered in such\na tone of sad entreaty that he resolved to persecute her no more; she\nshould not even be distressed by a sight of his form in the distant\nperspective of the street and lane.  He left the place, and his natural\ncourse was to London.\n\nThe railway to South Wessex was in process of construction, but it was\nnot as yet opened for traffic; and Hipcroft reached the capital by a six\ndays' trudge on foot, as many a better man had done before him.  He was\none of the last of the artisan class who used that now extinct method of\ntravel to the great centres of labour, so customary then from time\nimmemorial.\n\nIn London he lived and worked regularly at his trade.  More fortunate\nthan many, his disinterested willingness recommended him from the first.\nDuring the ensuing four years he was never out of employment.  He neither\nadvanced nor receded in the modern sense; he improved as a workman, but\nhe did not shift one jot in social position.  About his love for Car'line\nhe maintained a rigid silence.  No doubt he often thought of her; but\nbeing always occupied, and having no relations at Stickleford, he held no\ncommunication with that part of the country, and showed no desire to\nreturn.  In his quiet lodging in Lambeth he moved about after working-\nhours with the facility of a woman, doing his own cooking, attending to\nhis stocking-heels, and shaping himself by degrees to a life-long\nbachelorhood.  For this conduct one is bound to advance the canonical\nreason that time could not efface from his heart the image of little\nCar'line Aspent--and it may be in part true; but there was also the\ninference that his was a nature not greatly dependent upon the\nministrations of the other sex for its comforts.\n\nThe fourth year of his residence as a mechanic in London was the year of\nthe Hyde-Park Exhibition already mentioned, and at the construction of\nthis huge glass-house, then unexampled in the world's history, he worked\ndaily.  It was an era of great hope and activity among the nations and\nindustries.  Though Hipcroft was, in his small way, a central man in the\nmovement, he plodded on with his usual outward placidity.  Yet for him,\ntoo, the year was destined to have its surprises, for when the bustle of\ngetting the building ready for the opening day was past, the ceremonies\nhad been witnessed, and people were flocking thither from all parts of\nthe globe, he received a letter from Car'line.  Till that day the silence\nof four years between himself and Stickleford had never been broken.\n\nShe informed her old lover, in an uncertain penmanship which suggested a\ntrembling hand, of the trouble she had been put to in ascertaining his\naddress, and then broached the subject which had prompted her to write.\nFour years ago, she said with the greatest delicacy of which she was\ncapable, she had been so foolish as to refuse him.  Her wilful\nwrong-headedness had since been a grief to her many times, and of late\nparticularly.  As for Mr. Ollamoor, he had been absent almost as long as\nNed--she did not know where.  She would gladly marry Ned now if he were\nto ask her again, and be a tender little wife to him till her life's end.\n\nA tide of warm feeling must have surged through Ned Hipcroft's frame on\nreceipt of this news, if we may judge by the issue.  Unquestionably he\nloved her still, even if not to the exclusion of every other happiness.\nThis from his Car'line, she who had been dead to him these many years,\nalive to him again as of old, was in itself a pleasant, gratifying thing.\nNed had grown so resigned to, or satisfied with, his lonely lot, that he\nprobably would not have shown much jubilation at anything.  Still, a\ncertain ardour of preoccupation, after his first surprise, revealed how\ndeeply her confession of faith in him had stirred him.  Measured and\nmethodical in his ways, he did not answer the letter that day, nor the\nnext, nor the next.  He was having 'a good think.'  When he did answer\nit, there was a great deal of sound reasoning mixed in with the\nunmistakable tenderness of his reply; but the tenderness itself was\nsufficient to reveal that he was pleased with her straightforward\nfrankness; that the anchorage she had once obtained in his heart was\nrenewable, if it had not been continuously firm.\n\nHe told her--and as he wrote his lips twitched humorously over the few\ngentle words of raillery he indited among the rest of his sentences--that\nit was all very well for her to come round at this time of day.  Why\nwouldn't she have him when he wanted her?  She had no doubt learned that\nhe was not married, but suppose his affections had since been fixed on\nanother?  She ought to beg his pardon.  Still, he was not the man to\nforget her.  But considering how he had been used, and what he had\nsuffered, she could not quite expect him to go down to Stickleford and\nfetch her.  But if she would come to him, and say she was sorry, as was\nonly fair; why, yes, he would marry her, knowing what a good little woman\nshe was at the core.  He added that the request for her to come to him\nwas a less one to make than it would have been when he first left\nStickleford, or even a few months ago; for the new railway into South\nWessex was now open, and there had just begun to be run wonderfully\ncontrived special trains, called excursion-trains, on account of the\nGreat Exhibition; so that she could come up easily alone.\n\nShe said in her reply how good it was of him to treat her so generously,\nafter her hot and cold treatment of him; that though she felt frightened\nat the magnitude of the journey, and was never as yet in a railway-train,\nhaving only seen one pass at a distance, she embraced his offer with all\nher heart; and would, indeed, own to him how sorry she was, and beg his\npardon, and try to be a good wife always, and make up for lost time.\n\nThe remaining details of when and where were soon settled, Car'line\ninforming him, for her ready identification in the crowd, that she would\nbe wearing 'my new sprigged-laylock cotton gown,' and Ned gaily\nresponding that, having married her the morning after her arrival, he\nwould make a day of it by taking her to the Exhibition.  One early summer\nafternoon, accordingly, he came from his place of work, and hastened\ntowards Waterloo Station to meet her.  It was as wet and chilly as an\nEnglish June day can occasionally be, but as he waited on the platform in\nthe drizzle he glowed inwardly, and seemed to have something to live for\nagain.\n\nThe 'excursion-train'--an absolutely new departure in the history of\ntravel--was still a novelty on the Wessex line, and probably everywhere.\nCrowds of people had flocked to all the stations on the way up to witness\nthe unwonted sight of so long a train's passage, even where they did not\ntake advantage of the opportunity it offered.  The seats for the humbler\nclass of travellers in these early experiments in steam-locomotion, were\nopen trucks, without any protection whatever from the wind and rain; and\ndamp weather having set in with the afternoon, the unfortunate occupants\nof these vehicles were, on the train drawing up at the London terminus,\nfound to be in a pitiable condition from their long journey; blue-faced,\nstiff-necked, sneezing, rain-beaten, chilled to the marrow, many of the\nmen being hatless; in fact, they resembled people who had been out all\nnight in an open boat on a rough sea, rather than inland excursionists\nfor pleasure.  The women had in some degree protected themselves by\nturning up the skirts of their gowns over their heads, but as by this\narrangement they were additionally exposed about the hips, they were all\nmore or less in a sorry plight.\n\nIn the bustle and crush of alighting forms of both sexes which followed\nthe entry of the huge concatenation into the station, Ned Hipcroft soon\ndiscerned the slim little figure his eye was in search of, in the\nsprigged lilac, as described.  She came up to him with a frightened\nsmile--still pretty, though so damp, weather-beaten, and shivering from\nlong exposure to the wind.\n\n'O Ned!' she sputtered, 'I--I--'  He clasped her in his arms and kissed\nher, whereupon she burst into a flood of tears.\n\n'You are wet, my poor dear!  I hope you'll not get cold,' he said.  And\nsurveying her and her multifarious surrounding packages, he noticed that\nby the hand she led a toddling child--a little girl of three or so--whose\nhood was as clammy and tender face as blue as those of the other\ntravellers.\n\n'Who is this--somebody you know?' asked Ned curiously.\n\n'Yes, Ned.  She's mine.'\n\n'Yours?'\n\n'Yes--my own!'\n\n'Your own child?'\n\n'Yes!'\n\n'Well--as God's in--'\n\n'Ned, I didn't name it in my letter, because, you see, it would have been\nso hard to explain!  I thought that when we met I could tell you how she\nhappened to be born, so much better than in writing!  I hope you'll\nexcuse it this once, dear Ned, and not scold me, now I've come so many,\nmany miles!'\n\n'This means Mr. Mop Ollamoor, I reckon!' said Hipcroft, gazing palely at\nthem from the distance of the yard or two to which he had withdrawn with\na start.\n\nCar'line gasped.  'But he's been gone away for years!' she supplicated.\n'And I never had a young man before!  And I was so onlucky to be catched\nthe first time, though some of the girls down there go on like anything!'\n\nNed remained in silence, pondering.\n\n'You'll forgive me, dear Ned?' she added, beginning to sob outright.  'I\nhaven't taken 'ee in after all, because--because you can pack us back\nagain, if you want to; though 'tis hundreds o' miles, and so wet, and\nnight a-coming on, and I with no money!'\n\n'What the devil can I do!' Hipcroft groaned.\n\nA more pitiable picture than the pair of helpless creatures presented was\nnever seen on a rainy day, as they stood on the great, gaunt, puddled\nplatform, a whiff of drizzle blowing under the roof upon them now and\nthen; the pretty attire in which they had started from Stickleford in the\nearly morning bemuddled and sodden, weariness on their faces, and fear of\nhim in their eyes; for the child began to look as if she thought she too\nhad done some wrong, remaining in an appalled silence till the tears\nrolled down her chubby cheeks.\n\n'What's the matter, my little maid?' said Ned mechanically.\n\n'I do want to go home!' she let out, in tones that told of a bursting\nheart.  'And my totties be cold, an' I shan't have no bread an' butter no\nmore!'\n\n'I don't know what to say to it all!' declared Ned, his own eye moist as\nhe turned and walked a few steps with his head down; then regarded them\nagain point blank.  From the child escaped troubled breaths and silently\nwelling tears.\n\n'Want some bread and butter, do 'ee?' he said, with factitious hardness.\n\n'Ye-e-s!'\n\n'Well, I daresay I can get 'ee a bit!  Naturally, you must want some.  And\nyou, too, for that matter, Car'line.'\n\n'I do feel a little hungered.  But I can keep it off,' she murmured.\n\n'Folk shouldn't do that,' he said gruffly. . . . 'There come along!' he\ncaught up the child, as he added, 'You must bide here to-night, anyhow, I\ns'pose!  What can you do otherwise?  I'll get 'ee some tea and victuals;\nand as for this job, I'm sure I don't know what to say!  This is the way\nout.'\n\nThey pursued their way, without speaking, to Ned's lodgings, which were\nnot far off.  There he dried them and made them comfortable, and prepared\ntea; they thankfully sat down.  The ready-made household of which he\nsuddenly found himself the head imparted a cosy aspect to his room, and a\npaternal one to himself.  Presently he turned to the child and kissed her\nnow blooming cheeks; and, looking wistfully at Car'line, kissed her also.\n\n'I don't see how I can send 'ee back all them miles,' he growled, 'now\nyou've come all the way o' purpose to join me.  But you must trust me,\nCar'line, and show you've real faith in me.  Well, do you feel better\nnow, my little woman?'\n\nThe child nodded, her mouth being otherwise occupied.\n\n'I did trust you, Ned, in coming; and I shall always!'\n\nThus, without any definite agreement to forgive her, he tacitly\nacquiesced in the fate that Heaven had sent him; and on the day of their\nmarriage (which was not quite so soon as he had expected it could be, on\naccount of the time necessary for banns) he took her to the Exhibition\nwhen they came back from church, as he had promised.  While standing near\na large mirror in one of the courts devoted to furniture, Car'line\nstarted, for in the glass appeared the reflection of a form exactly\nresembling Mop Ollamoor's--so exactly, that it seemed impossible to\nbelieve anybody but that artist in person to be the original.  On passing\nround the objects which hemmed in Ned, her, and the child from a direct\nview, no Mop was to be seen.  Whether he were really in London or not at\nthat time was never known; and Car'line always stoutly denied that her\nreadiness to go and meet Ned in town arose from any rumour that Mop had\nalso gone thither; which denial there was no reasonable ground for\ndoubting.\n\nAnd then the year glided away, and the Exhibition folded itself up and\nbecame a thing of the past.  The park trees that had been enclosed for\nsix months were again exposed to the winds and storms, and the sod grew\ngreen anew.  Ned found that Car'line resolved herself into a very good\nwife and companion, though she had made herself what is called cheap to\nhim; but in that she was like another domestic article, a cheap tea-pot,\nwhich often brews better tea than a dear one.  One autumn Hipcroft found\nhimself with but little work to do, and a prospect of less for the\nwinter.  Both being country born and bred, they fancied they would like\nto live again in their natural atmosphere.  It was accordingly decided\nbetween them that they should leave the pent-up London lodging, and that\nNed should seek out employment near his native place, his wife and her\ndaughter staying with Car'line's father during the search for occupation\nand an abode of their own.\n\nTinglings of pleasure pervaded Car'line's spasmodic little frame as she\njourneyed down with Ned to the place she had left two or three years\nbefore, in silence and under a cloud.  To return to where she had once\nbeen despised, a smiling London wife with a distinct London accent, was a\ntriumph which the world did not witness every day.\n\nThe train did not stop at the petty roadside station that lay nearest to\nStickleford, and the trio went on to Casterbridge.  Ned thought it a good\nopportunity to make a few preliminary inquiries for employment at\nworkshops in the borough where he had been known; and feeling cold from\nher journey, and it being dry underfoot and only dusk as yet, with a moon\non the point of rising, Car'line and her little girl walked on toward\nStickleford, leaving Ned to follow at a quicker pace, and pick her up at\na certain half-way house, widely known as an inn.\n\nThe woman and child pursued the well-remembered way comfortably enough,\nthough they were both becoming wearied.  In the course of three miles\nthey had passed Heedless-William's Pond, the familiar landmark by Bloom's\nEnd, and were drawing near the Quiet Woman Inn, a lone roadside hostel on\nthe lower verge of the Egdon Heath, since and for many years abolished.\nIn stepping up towards it Car'line heard more voices within than had\nformerly been customary at such an hour, and she learned that an auction\nof fat stock had been held near the spot that afternoon.  The child would\nbe the better for a rest as well as herself, she thought, and she\nentered.\n\nThe guests and customers overflowed into the passage, and Car'line had no\nsooner crossed the threshold than a man whom she remembered by sight came\nforward with glass and mug in his hands towards a friend leaning against\nthe wall; but, seeing her, very gallantly offered her a drink of the\nliquor, which was gin-and-beer hot, pouring her out a tumblerful and\nsaying, in a moment or two: 'Surely, 'tis little Car'line Aspent that\nwas--down at Stickleford?'\n\nShe assented, and, though she did not exactly want this beverage, she\ndrank it since it was offered, and her entertainer begged her to come in\nfarther and sit down.  Once within the room she found that all the\npersons present were seated close against the walls, and there being a\nchair vacant she did the same.  An explanation of their position occurred\nthe next moment.  In the opposite corner stood Mop, rosining his bow and\nlooking just the same as ever.  The company had cleared the middle of the\nroom for dancing, and they were about to dance again.  As she wore a veil\nto keep off the wind she did not think he had recognized her, or could\npossibly guess the identity of the child; and to her satisfied surprise\nshe found that she could confront him quite calmly--mistress of herself\nin the dignity her London life had given her.  Before she had quite\nemptied her glass the dance was called, the dancers formed in two lines,\nthe music sounded, and the figure began.\n\nThen matters changed for Car'line.  A tremor quickened itself to life in\nher, and her hand so shook that she could hardly set down her glass.  It\nwas not the dance nor the dancers, but the notes of that old violin which\nthrilled the London wife, these having still all the witchery that she\nhad so well known of yore, and under which she had used to lose her power\nof independent will.  How it all came back!  There was the fiddling\nfigure against the wall; the large, oily, mop-like head of him, and\nbeneath the mop the face with closed eyes.\n\nAfter the first moments of paralyzed reverie the familiar tune in the\nfamiliar rendering made her laugh and shed tears simultaneously.  Then a\nman at the bottom of the dance, whose partner had dropped away, stretched\nout his hand and beckoned to her to take the place.  She did not want to\ndance; she entreated by signs to be left where she was, but she was\nentreating of the tune and its player rather than of the dancing man.  The\nsaltatory tendency which the fiddler and his cunning instrument had ever\nbeen able to start in her was seizing Car'line just as it had done in\nearlier years, possibly assisted by the gin-and-beer hot.  Tired as she\nwas she grasped her little girl by the hand, and plunging in at the\nbottom of the figure, whirled about with the rest.  She found that her\ncompanions were mostly people of the neighbouring hamlets and\nfarms--Bloom's End, Mellstock, Lewgate, and elsewhere; and by degrees she\nwas recognized as she convulsively danced on, wishing that Mop would\ncease and let her heart rest from the aching he caused, and her feet\nalso.\n\nAfter long and many minutes the dance ended, when she was urged to\nfortify herself with more gin-and-beer; which she did, feeling very weak\nand overpowered with hysteric emotion.  She refrained from unveiling, to\nkeep Mop in ignorance of her presence, if possible.  Several of the\nguests having left, Car'line hastily wiped her lips and also turned to\ngo; but, according to the account of some who remained, at that very\nmoment a five-handed reel was proposed, in which two or three begged her\nto join.\n\nShe declined on the plea of being tired and having to walk to\nStickleford, when Mop began aggressively tweedling 'My Fancy-Lad,' in D\nmajor, as the air to which the reel was to be footed.  He must have\nrecognized her, though she did not know it, for it was the strain of all\nseductive strains which she was least able to resist--the one he had\nplayed when she was leaning over the bridge at the date of their first\nacquaintance.  Car'line stepped despairingly into the middle of the room\nwith the other four.\n\nReels were resorted to hereabouts at this time by the more robust\nspirits, for the reduction of superfluous energy which the ordinary\nfigure-dances were not powerful enough to exhaust.  As everybody knows,\nor does not know, the five reelers stood in the form of a cross, the reel\nbeing performed by each line of three alternately, the persons who\nsuccessively came to the middle place dancing in both directions.\nCar'line soon found herself in this place, the axis of the whole\nperformance, and could not get out of it, the tune turning into the first\npart without giving her opportunity.  And now she began to suspect that\nMop did know her, and was doing this on purpose, though whenever she\nstole a glance at him his closed eyes betokened obliviousness to\neverything outside his own brain.  She continued to wend her way through\nthe figure of 8 that was formed by her course, the fiddler introducing\ninto his notes the wild and agonizing sweetness of a living voice in one\ntoo highly wrought; its pathos running high and running low in endless\nvariation, projecting through her nerves excruciating spasms, a sort of\nblissful torture.  The room swam, the tune was endless; and in about a\nquarter of an hour the only other woman in the figure dropped out\nexhausted, and sank panting on a bench.\n\nThe reel instantly resolved itself into a four-handed one.  Car'line\nwould have given anything to leave off; but she had, or fancied she had,\nno power, while Mop played such tunes; and thus another ten minutes\nslipped by, a haze of dust now clouding the candles, the floor being of\nstone, sanded.  Then another dancer fell out--one of the men--and went\ninto the passage, in a frantic search for liquor.  To turn the figure\ninto a three-handed reel was the work of a second, Mop modulating at the\nsame time into 'The Fairy Dance,' as better suited to the contracted\nmovement, and no less one of those foods of love which, as manufactured\nby his bow, had always intoxicated her.\n\nIn a reel for three there was no rest whatever, and four or five minutes\nwere enough to make her remaining two partners, now thoroughly blown,\nstamp their last bar and, like their predecessors, limp off into the next\nroom to get something to drink.  Car'line, half-stifled inside her veil,\nwas left dancing alone, the apartment now being empty of everybody save\nherself, Mop, and their little girl.\n\nShe flung up the veil, and cast her eyes upon him, as if imploring him to\nwithdraw himself and his acoustic magnetism from the atmosphere.  Mop\nopened one of his own orbs, as though for the first time, fixed it\npeeringly upon her, and smiling dreamily, threw into his strains the\nreserve of expression which he could not afford to waste on a big and\nnoisy dance.  Crowds of little chromatic subtleties, capable of drawing\ntears from a statue, proceeded straightway from the ancient fiddle, as if\nit were dying of the emotion which had been pent up within it ever since\nits banishment from some Italian city where it first took shape and\nsound.  There was that in the look of Mop's one dark eye which said: 'You\ncannot leave off, dear, whether you would or no!' and it bred in her a\nparoxysm of desperation that defied him to tire her down.\n\nShe thus continued to dance alone, defiantly as she thought, but in truth\nslavishly and abjectly, subject to every wave of the melody, and probed\nby the gimlet-like gaze of her fascinator's open eye; keeping up at the\nsame time a feeble smile in his face, as a feint to signify it was still\nher own pleasure which led her on.  A terrified embarrassment as to what\nshe could say to him if she were to leave off, had its unrecognized share\nin keeping her going.  The child, who was beginning to be distressed by\nthe strange situation, came up and said: 'Stop, mother, stop, and let's\ngo home!' as she seized Car'line's hand.\n\nSuddenly Car'line sank staggering to the floor; and rolling over on her\nface, prone she remained.  Mop's fiddle thereupon emitted an elfin shriek\nof finality; stepping quickly down from the nine-gallon beer-cask which\nhad formed his rostrum, he went to the little girl, who disconsolately\nbent over her mother.\n\nThe guests who had gone into the back-room for liquor and change of air,\nhearing something unusual, trooped back hitherward, where they\nendeavoured to revive poor, weak Car'line by blowing her with the bellows\nand opening the window.  Ned, her husband, who had been detained in\nCasterbridge, as aforesaid, came along the road at this juncture, and\nhearing excited voices through the open casement, and to his great\nsurprise, the mention of his wife's name, he entered amid the rest upon\nthe scene.  Car'line was now in convulsions, weeping violently, and for a\nlong time nothing could be done with her.  While he was sending for a\ncart to take her onward to Stickleford Hipcroft anxiously inquired how it\nhad all happened; and then the assembly explained that a fiddler formerly\nknown in the locality had lately revisited his old haunts, and had taken\nupon himself without invitation to play that evening at the inn.\n\nNed demanded the fiddler's name, and they said Ollamoor.\n\n'Ah!' exclaimed Ned, looking round him.  'Where is he, and where--where's\nmy little girl?'\n\nOllamoor had disappeared, and so had the child.  Hipcroft was in ordinary\na quiet and tractable fellow, but a determination which was to be feared\nsettled in his face now.  'Blast him!' he cried.  'I'll beat his skull in\nfor'n, if I swing for it to-morrow!'\n\nHe had rushed to the poker which lay on the hearth, and hastened down the\npassage, the people following.  Outside the house, on the other side of\nthe highway, a mass of dark heath-land rose sullenly upward to its not\neasily accessible interior, a ravined plateau, whereon jutted into the\nsky, at the distance of a couple of miles, the fir-woods of Mistover\nbacked by the Yalbury coppices--a place of Dantesque gloom at this hour,\nwhich would have afforded secure hiding for a battery of artillery, much\nless a man and a child.\n\nSome other men plunged thitherward with him, and more went along the\nroad.  They were gone about twenty minutes altogether, returning without\nresult to the inn.  Ned sat down in the settle, and clasped his forehead\nwith his hands.\n\n'Well--what a fool the man is, and hev been all these years, if he thinks\nthe child his, as a' do seem to!' they whispered.  'And everybody else\nknowing otherwise!'\n\n'No, I don't think 'tis mine!' cried Ned hoarsely, as he looked up from\nhis hands.  'But she is mine, all the same!  Ha'n't I nussed her?  Ha'n't\nI fed her and teached her?  Ha'n't I played wi' her?  O, little\nCarry--gone with that rogue--gone!'\n\n'You ha'n't lost your mis'ess, anyhow,' they said to console him.  'She's\nthrowed up the sperrits, and she is feeling better, and she's more to 'ee\nthan a child that isn't yours.'\n\n'She isn't!  She's not so particular much to me, especially now she's\nlost the little maid!  But Carry's everything!'\n\n'Well, ver' like you'll find her to-morrow.'\n\n'Ah--but shall I?  Yet he _can't_ hurt her--surely he can't!  Well--how's\nCar'line now?  I am ready.  Is the cart here?'\n\nShe was lifted into the vehicle, and they sadly lumbered on toward\nStickleford.  Next day she was calmer; but the fits were still upon her;\nand her will seemed shattered.  For the child she appeared to show\nsingularly little anxiety, though Ned was nearly distracted.  It was\nnevertheless quite expected that the impish Mop would restore the lost\none after a freak of a day or two; but time went on, and neither he nor\nshe could be heard of, and Hipcroft murmured that perhaps he was\nexercising upon her some unholy musical charm, as he had done upon\nCar'line herself.  Weeks passed, and still they could obtain no clue\neither to the fiddler's whereabouts or the girl's; and how he could have\ninduced her to go with him remained a mystery.\n\nThen Ned, who had obtained only temporary employment in the\nneighbourhood, took a sudden hatred toward his native district, and a\nrumour reaching his ears through the police that a somewhat similar man\nand child had been seen at a fair near London, he playing a violin, she\ndancing on stilts, a new interest in the capital took possession of\nHipcroft with an intensity which would scarcely allow him time to pack\nbefore returning thither.\n\nHe did not, however, find the lost one, though he made it the entire\nbusiness of his over-hours to stand about in by-streets in the hope of\ndiscovering her, and would start up in the night, saying, 'That rascal's\ntorturing her to maintain him!'  To which his wife would answer\npeevishly, 'Don't 'ee raft yourself so, Ned!  You prevent my getting a\nbit o' rest!  He won't hurt her!' and fall asleep again.\n\nThat Carry and her father had emigrated to America was the general\nopinion; Mop, no doubt, finding the girl a highly desirable companion\nwhen he had trained her to keep him by her earnings as a dancer.  There,\nfor that matter, they may be performing in some capacity now, though he\nmust be an old scamp verging on threescore-and-ten, and she a woman of\nfour-and-forty.\n\n","The widely discussed possibility of an invasion of England through a\nChannel tunnel has more than once recalled old Solomon Selby's story to\nmy mind.\n\nThe occasion on which I numbered myself among his audience was one\nevening when he was sitting in the yawning chimney-corner of the\ninn-kitchen, with some others who had gathered there, and I entered for\nshelter from the rain.  Withdrawing the stem of his pipe from the dental\nnotch in which it habitually rested, he leaned back in the recess behind\nhim and smiled into the fire.  The smile was neither mirthful nor sad,\nnot precisely humorous nor altogether thoughtful.  We who knew him\nrecognized it in a moment: it was his narrative smile.  Breaking off our\nfew desultory remarks we drew up closer, and he thus began:--\n\n'My father, as you mid know, was a shepherd all his life, and lived out\nby the Cove four miles yonder, where I was born and lived likewise, till\nI moved here shortly afore I was married.  The cottage that first knew me\nstood on the top of the down, near the sea; there was no house within a\nmile and a half of it; it was built o' purpose for the farm-shepherd, and\nhad no other use.  They tell me that it is now pulled down, but that you\ncan see where it stood by the mounds of earth and a few broken bricks\nthat are still lying about.  It was a bleak and dreary place in winter-\ntime, but in summer it was well enough, though the garden never came to\nmuch, because we could not get up a good shelter for the vegetables and\ncurrant bushes; and where there is much wind they don't thrive.\n\n'Of all the years of my growing up the ones that bide clearest in my mind\nwere eighteen hundred and three, four, and five.  This was for two\nreasons: I had just then grown to an age when a child's eyes and ears\ntake in and note down everything about him, and there was more at that\ndate to bear in mind than there ever has been since with me.  It was, as\nI need hardly tell ye, the time after the first peace, when Bonaparte was\nscheming his descent upon England.  He had crossed the great Alp\nmountains, fought in Egypt, drubbed the Turks, the Austrians, and the\nProossians, and now thought he'd have a slap at us.  On the other side of\nthe Channel, scarce out of sight and hail of a man standing on our\nEnglish shore, the French army of a hundred and sixty thousand men and\nfifteen thousand horses had been brought together from all parts, and\nwere drilling every day.  Bonaparte had been three years a-making his\npreparations; and to ferry these soldiers and cannon and horses across he\nhad contrived a couple of thousand flat-bottomed boats.  These boats were\nsmall things, but wonderfully built.  A good few of 'em were so made as\nto have a little stable on board each for the two horses that were to\nhaul the cannon carried at the stern.  To get in order all these, and\nother things required, he had assembled there five or six thousand\nfellows that worked at trades--carpenters, blacksmiths, wheelwrights,\nsaddlers, and what not.  O 'twas a curious time!\n\n'Every morning Neighbour Boney would muster his multitude of soldiers on\nthe beach, draw 'em up in line, practise 'em in the manoeuvre of\nembarking, horses and all, till they could do it without a single hitch.\nMy father drove a flock of ewes up into Sussex that year, and as he went\nalong the drover's track over the high downs thereabout he could see this\ndrilling actually going on--the accoutrements of the rank and file\nglittering in the sun like silver.  It was thought and always said by my\nuncle Job, sergeant of foot (who used to know all about these matters),\nthat Bonaparte meant to cross with oars on a calm night.  The grand query\nwith us was, Where would my gentleman land?  Many of the common people\nthought it would be at Dover; others, who knew how unlikely it was that\nany skilful general would make a business of landing just where he was\nexpected, said he'd go either east into the River Thames, or west'ard to\nsome convenient place, most likely one of the little bays inside the Isle\nof Portland, between the Beal and St. Alban's Head--and for choice the\nthree-quarter-round Cove, screened from every mortal eye, that seemed\nmade o' purpose, out by where we lived, and which I've climmed up with\ntwo tubs of brandy across my shoulders on scores o' dark nights in my\nyounger days.  Some had heard that a part o' the French fleet would sail\nright round Scotland, and come up the Channel to a suitable haven.\nHowever, there was much doubt upon the matter; and no wonder, for after-\nyears proved that Bonaparte himself could hardly make up his mind upon\nthat great and very particular point, where to land.  His uncertainty\ncame about in this wise, that he could get no news as to where and how\nour troops lay in waiting, and that his knowledge of possible places\nwhere flat-bottomed boats might be quietly run ashore, and the men they\nbrought marshalled in order, was dim to the last degree.  Being\nflat-bottomed, they didn't require a harbour for unshipping their cargo\nof men, but a good shelving beach away from sight, and with a fair open\nroad toward London.  How the question posed that great Corsican tyrant\n(as we used to call him), what pains he took to settle it, and, above\nall, what a risk he ran on one particular night in trying to do so, were\nknown only to one man here and there; and certainly to no maker of\nnewspapers or printer of books, or my account o't would not have had so\nmany heads shaken over it as it has by gentry who only believe what they\nsee in printed lines.\n\n'The flocks my father had charge of fed all about the downs near our\nhouse, overlooking the sea and shore each way for miles.  In winter and\nearly spring father was up a deal at nights, watching and tending the\nlambing.  Often he'd go to bed early, and turn out at twelve or one; and\non the other hand, he'd sometimes stay up till twelve or one, and then\nturn in to bed.  As soon as I was old enough I used to help him, mostly\nin the way of keeping an eye upon the ewes while he was gone home to\nrest.  This is what I was doing in a particular month in either the year\nfour or five--I can't certainly fix which, but it was long before I was\ntook away from the sheepkeeping to be bound prentice to a trade.  Every\nnight at that time I was at the fold, about half a mile, or it may be a\nlittle more, from our cottage, and no living thing at all with me but the\newes and young lambs.  Afeard?  No; I was never afeard of being alone at\nthese times; for I had been reared in such an out-step place that the\nlack o' human beings at night made me less fearful than the sight of 'em.\nDirectly I saw a man's shape after dark in a lonely place I was\nfrightened out of my senses.\n\n'One day in that month we were surprised by a visit from my uncle Job,\nthe sergeant in the Sixty-first foot, then in camp on the downs above\nKing George's watering-place, several miles to the west yonder.  Uncle\nJob dropped in about dusk, and went up with my father to the fold for an\nhour or two.  Then he came home, had a drop to drink from the tub of\nsperrits that the smugglers kept us in for housing their liquor when\nthey'd made a run, and for burning 'em off when there was danger.  After\nthat he stretched himself out on the settle to sleep.  I went to bed: at\none o'clock father came home, and waking me to go and take his place,\naccording to custom, went to bed himself.  On my way out of the house I\npassed Uncle Job on the settle.  He opened his eyes, and upon my telling\nhim where I was going he said it was a shame that such a youngster as I\nshould go up there all alone; and when he had fastened up his stock and\nwaist-belt he set off along with me, taking a drop from the sperrit-tub\nin a little flat bottle that stood in the corner-cupboard.\n\n'By and by we drew up to the fold, saw that all was right, and then, to\nkeep ourselves warm, curled up in a heap of straw that lay inside the\nthatched hurdles we had set up to break the stroke of the wind when there\nwas any.  To-night, however, there was none.  It was one of those very\nstill nights when, if you stand on the high hills anywhere within two or\nthree miles of the sea, you can hear the rise and fall of the tide along\nthe shore, coming and going every few moments like a sort of great snore\nof the sleeping world.  Over the lower ground there was a bit of a mist,\nbut on the hill where we lay the air was clear, and the moon, then in her\nlast quarter, flung a fairly good light on the grass and scattered straw.\n\n'While we lay there Uncle Job amused me by telling me strange stories of\nthe wars he had served in and the wounds he had got.  He had already\nfought the French in the Low Countries, and hoped to fight 'em again.  His\nstories lasted so long that at last I was hardly sure that I was not a\nsoldier myself, and had seen such service as he told of.  The wonders of\nhis tales quite bewildered my mind, till I fell asleep and dreamed of\nbattle, smoke, and flying soldiers, all of a kind with the doings he had\nbeen bringing up to me.\n\n'How long my nap lasted I am not prepared to say.  But some faint sounds\nover and above the rustle of the ewes in the straw, the bleat of the\nlambs, and the tinkle of the sheep-bell brought me to my waking senses.\nUncle Job was still beside me; but he too had fallen asleep.  I looked\nout from the straw, and saw what it was that had aroused me.  Two men, in\nboat-cloaks, cocked hats, and swords, stood by the hurdles about twenty\nyards off.\n\n'I turned my ear thitherward to catch what they were saying, but though I\nheard every word o't, not one did I understand.  They spoke in a tongue\nthat was not ours--in French, as I afterward found.  But if I could not\ngain the meaning of a word, I was shrewd boy enough to find out a deal of\nthe talkers' business.  By the light o' the moon I could see that one of\n'em carried a roll of paper in his hand, while every moment he spoke\nquick to his comrade, and pointed right and left with the other hand to\nspots along the shore.  There was no doubt that he was explaining to the\nsecond gentleman the shapes and features of the coast.  What happened\nsoon after made this still clearer to me.\n\n'All this time I had not waked Uncle Job, but now I began to be afeared\nthat they might light upon us, because uncle breathed so heavily\nthrough's nose.  I put my mouth to his ear and whispered, \"Uncle Job.\"\n\n'\"What is it, my boy?\" he said, just as if he hadn't been asleep at all.\n\n'\"Hush!\" says I.  \"Two French generals--\"\n\n'\"French?\" says he.\n\n'\"Yes,\" says I.  \"Come to see where to land their army!\"\n\n'I pointed 'em out; but I could say no more, for the pair were coming at\nthat moment much nearer to where we lay.  As soon as they got as near as\neight or ten yards, the officer with a roll in his hand stooped down to a\nslanting hurdle, unfastened his roll upon it, and spread it out.  Then\nsuddenly he sprung a dark lantern open on the paper, and showed it to be\na map.\n\n'\"What be they looking at?\" I whispered to Uncle Job.\n\n'\"A chart of the Channel,\" says the sergeant (knowing about such things).\n\n'The other French officer now stooped likewise, and over the map they had\na long consultation, as they pointed here and there on the paper, and\nthen hither and thither at places along the shore beneath us.  I noticed\nthat the manner of one officer was very respectful toward the other, who\nseemed much his superior, the second in rank calling him by a sort of\ntitle that I did not know the sense of.  The head one, on the other hand,\nwas quite familiar with his friend, and more than once clapped him on the\nshoulder.\n\n'Uncle Job had watched as well as I, but though the map had been in the\nlantern-light, their faces had always been in shade.  But when they rose\nfrom stooping over the chart the light flashed upward, and fell smart\nupon one of 'em's features.  No sooner had this happened than Uncle Job\ngasped, and sank down as if he'd been in a fit.\n\n'\"What is it--what is it, Uncle Job?\" said I.\n\n'\"O good God!\" says he, under the straw.\n\n'\"What?\" says I.\n\n'\"Boney!\" he groaned out.\n\n'\"Who?\" says I.\n\n'\"Bonaparty,\" he said.  \"The Corsican ogre.  O that I had got but my new-\nflinted firelock, that there man should die!  But I haven't got my new-\nflinted firelock, and that there man must live.  So lie low, as you value\nyour life!\"\n\n'I did lie low, as you mid suppose.  But I couldn't help peeping.  And\nthen I too, lad as I was, knew that it was the face of Bonaparte.  Not\nknow Boney?  I should think I did know Boney.  I should have known him by\nhalf the light o' that lantern.  If I had seen a picture of his features\nonce, I had seen it a hundred times.  There was his bullet head, his\nshort neck, his round yaller cheeks and chin, his gloomy face, and his\ngreat glowing eyes.  He took off his hat to blow himself a bit, and there\nwas the forelock in the middle of his forehead, as in all the draughts of\nhim.  In moving, his cloak fell a little open, and I could see for a\nmoment his white-fronted jacket and one of his epaulets.\n\n'But none of this lasted long.  In a minute he and his general had rolled\nup the map, shut the lantern, and turned to go down toward the shore.\n\n'Then Uncle Job came to himself a bit.  \"Slipped across in the night-time\nto see how to put his men ashore,\" he said.  \"The like o' that man's\ncoolness eyes will never again see!  Nephew, I must act in this, and\nimmediate, or England's lost!\"\n\n'When they were over the brow, we crope out, and went some little way to\nlook after them.  Half-way down they were joined by two others, and six\nor seven minutes brought them to the shore.  Then, from behind a rock, a\nboat came out into the weak moonlight of the Cove, and they jumped in; it\nput off instantly, and vanished in a few minutes between the two rocks\nthat stand at the mouth of the Cove as we all know.  We climmed back to\nwhere we had been before, and I could see, a little way out, a larger\nvessel, though still not very large.  The little boat drew up alongside,\nwas made fast at the stern as I suppose, for the largest sailed away, and\nwe saw no more.\n\n'My uncle Job told his officers as soon as he got back to camp; but what\nthey thought of it I never heard--neither did he.  Boney's army never\ncame, and a good job for me; for the Cove below my father's house was\nwhere he meant to land, as this secret visit showed.  We coast-folk\nshould have been cut down one and all, and I should not have sat here to\ntell this tale.'\n\nWe who listened to old Selby that night have been familiar with his\nsimple grave-stone for these ten years past.  Thanks to the incredulity\nof the age his tale has been seldom repeated.  But if anything short of\nthe direct testimony of his own eyes could persuade an auditor that\nBonaparte had examined these shores for himself with a view to a\npracticable landing-place, it would have been Solomon Selby's manner of\nnarrating the adventure which befell him on the down.\n\n","Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night and wouldn't you love to love her?\nTakes to the sky like a bird in flight and who will be her lover?\n\nAll your life you've never seen a woman taken by the wind.\nWould you stay if she promised you heaven?\nWill you ever win?\n\nShe is like a cat in the dark and then she is the darkness.\nShe rules her life like a fine skylark and when the sky is starless.\n\nShe rings like a bell through the night and wouldn't you love to love her?\nShe rules her life like a bird in flight and who will be her lover?\n\n","The lemon, Citrus limon Osbeck, is a species of small evergreen tree in the flowering plant family Rutaceae, native to Asia. The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit is used for culinary and non-culinary purposes throughout the world, primarily for its juice, which has both culinary and cleaning uses. The pulp and rind (zest) are also used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is about 5% to 6% citric acid, with a pH of around 2.2, giving it a sour taste. The distinctive sour taste of lemon juice makes it a key ingredient in drinks and foods such as lemonade and lemon meringue pie.\nThe origin of the lemon is unknown, though lemons are thought to have first grown in Assam (a region in northeast India), northern Burma or China. A study of the genetic origin of the lemon reported it to be hybrid between bitter orange (sour orange) and citron. Lemons entered Europe near southern Italy no later than the second century AD, during the time of Ancient Rome. However, they were not widely cultivated. They were later introduced to Persia and then to Iraq and Egypt around 700 AD. The lemon was first recorded in literature in a 10th-century Arabic treatise on farming, and was also used as an ornamental plant in early Islamic gardens. It was distributed widely throughout the Arab world and the Mediterranean region between 1000 and 1150. The first substantial cultivation of lemons in Europe began in Genoa in the middle of the 15th century. The lemon was later introduced to the Americas in 1493 when Christopher Columbus brought lemon seeds to Hispaniola on his voyages. Spanish conquest throughout the New World helped spread lemon seeds. It was mainly used as an ornamental plant and for medicine. In the 19th century, lemons were increasingly planted in Florida and California. In 1747, James Lind's experiments on seamen suffering from scurvy involved adding lemon juice to their diets, though vitamin C was not yet known. The origin of the word \"lemon\" may be Middle Eastern. The word draws from the Old French limon, then Italian limone, from the Arabic laymūn or līmūn, and from the Persian līmūn, a generic term for citrus fruit, which is a cognate of Sanskrit (nimbū, “lime”).\nThe 'Bonnie Brae' is oblong, smooth, thin-skinned, and seedless, mostly grown in San Diego County, USA. The 'Eureka' grows year-round and abundantly. This is the common supermarket lemon, also known as 'Four Seasons' (Quatre Saisons) because of its ability to produce fruit and flowers together throughout the year. This variety is also available as a plant to domestic customers. There is also a pink-fleshed Eureka lemon, with a green and yellow variegated outer skin. The 'Femminello St. Teresa', or 'Sorrento' is native to Italy. This fruit's zest is high in lemon oils. It is the variety traditionally used in the making of limoncello. The 'Meyer' is a cross between a lemon and possibly an orange or a mandarin, and was named after Frank N. Meyer, who first introduced it to the USA in 1908. Thin-skinned and slightly less acidic than the Lisbon and Eureka lemons, Meyer lemons require more care when shipping and are not widely grown on a commercial basis. Meyer lemons often mature to a yellow-orange color. They are slightly more frost-tolerant than other lemons. The 'Ponderosa' is more cold-sensitive than true lemons; the fruit are thick-skinned and very large. It is likely a citron-lemon hybrid. The 'Yen Ben' is an Australasian cultivar.\nLemons are a rich source of vitamin C, providing 64% of the Daily Value in a 100 g serving (table). Other essential nutrients, however, have insignificant content (table). Lemons contain numerous phytochemicals, including polyphenols, terpenes, and tannins. Lemon juice contains slightly more citric acid than lime juice (about 47 g/l), nearly twice the citric acid of grapefruit juice, and about five times the amount of citric acid found in orange juice.\nLemon juice, rind, and peel are used in a wide variety of foods and drinks. The whole lemon is used to make marmalade, lemon curd and lemon liqueur. Lemon slices and lemon rind are used as a garnish for food and drinks. Lemon zest, the grated outer rind of the fruit, is used to add flavor to baked goods, puddings, rice, and other dishes.\nLemon juice is used to make lemonade, soft drinks, and cocktails. It is used in marinades for fish, where its acid neutralizes amines in fish by converting them into nonvolatile ammonium salts, and meat, where the acid partially hydrolyzes tough collagen fibers, tenderizing the meat, but the low pH denatures the proteins, causing them to dry out when cooked. Lemon juice is frequently used in the United Kingdom to add to pancakes, especially on Shrove Tuesday. Lemon juice is also used as a short-term preservative on certain foods that tend to oxidize and turn brown after being sliced (enzymatic browning), such as apples, bananas, and avocados, where its acid denatures the enzymes.\nIn Morocco, lemons are preserved in jars or barrels of salt. The salt penetrates the peel and rind, softening them, and curing them so that they last almost indefinitely. The preserved lemon is used in a wide variety of dishes. Preserved lemons can also be found in Sicilian, Italian, Greek, and French dishes.\nThe leaves of the lemon tree are used to make a tea and for preparing cooked meats and seafoods.\nLemons were the primary commercial source of citric acid before the development of fermentation-based processes.\nThe juice of the lemon may be used for cleaning. A halved lemon dipped in salt or baking powder is used to brighten copper cookware. The acid dissolves the tarnish and the abrasives assist the cleaning. As a sanitary kitchen deodorizer the juice can deodorize, remove grease, bleach stains, and disinfect; when mixed with baking soda, it removes stains from plastic food storage containers. The oil of the lemon's peel also has various uses. It is used as a wood cleaner and polish, where its solvent property is employed to dissolve old wax, fingerprints, and grime. Lemon oil and orange oil are also used as a nontoxic insecticide treatment. A halved lemon is used as a finger moistener for those counting large amounts of bills, such as tellers and cashiers.\nLemon oil may be used in aromatherapy. Lemon oil aroma does not influence the human immune system, but may contribute to relaxation.\nOne educational science experiment involves attaching electrodes to a lemon and using it as a battery to produce electricity. Although very low power, several lemon batteries can power a small digital watch. These experiments also work with other fruits and vegetables. Lemon juice may be used as a simple invisible ink, developed by heat.\nLemons need a minimum temperature of around 7 C, so they are not hardy year round in temperate climates, but become hardier as they mature. Citrus require minimal pruning by trimming overcrowded branches, with the tallest branch cut back to encourage bushy growth. Throughout summer, pinching back tips of the most vigorous growth assures more abundant canopy development. As mature plants may produce unwanted, fast-growing shoots called ‘water shoots’, these are removed from the main branches at the bottom or middle of the plant. In cultivation in the UK, the cultivars ‘Meyer’ and ‘Variegata’ have gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).\nIn 2014, world production of lemons (data combined with limes) was 16.3 million tonnes. The top producers were India, Mexico, China, Argentina, and Brazil, collectively accounting for 59% of total production (table).\nMany plants taste or smell similar to lemons.\n\n","Good Morning plz call me sir","In linguistics, grammar is the set of structural rules governing the composition of clauses, phrases, and words in any given natural language. The term refers also to the study of such rules, and this field includes phonology, morphology, and syntax, often complemented by phonetics, semantics, and pragmatics.\nFor linguists, grammar refers to cognitive information underlying language use. Speakers of a language have a set of internalized rules for using that language. These rules constitute grammar, and the vast majority of the information in the grammar is—at least in the case of one's native language—acquired not by conscious study or instruction, but by observing other speakers. Much of this work is done during early childhood; learning a language later in life usually involves a greater degree of explicit instruction. The term \"grammar\" can also be used to describe the rules that govern the linguistic behaviour of a group of speakers. The term \"English grammar\", therefore, may have several meanings. It may refer to the whole of English grammar, that is, to the grammars of all the speakers of the language, in which case, the term encompasses a great deal of variation. Alternatively, it may refer only to what is common to the grammars of all, or of the vast majority of English speakers (such as subject–verb–object word order in simple declarative sentences). Or it may refer to the rules of a particular, relatively well-defined variety of English (such as standard English for a particular region). A specific description, study or analysis of such rules may also be referred to as a grammar. A reference book describing the grammar of a language is called a \"reference grammar\" or simply \"a grammar\" (see History of English grammars). A fully explicit grammar that exhaustively describes the grammatical constructions of a language is called a descriptive grammar. This kind of linguistic description contrasts with linguistic prescription, an attempt to discourage or suppress some grammatical constructions, while promoting others. For example, preposition stranding occurs widely in Germanic languages and has a long history in English. John Dryden, however, objected to it (without explanation), leading other English speakers to avoid the construction and discourage its use. Outside linguistics the term grammar is often used in a rather different sense. In some respects, it may be used more broadly, including rules of spelling and punctuation, which linguists would not typically consider to form part of grammar, but rather as a part of orthography, the set of conventions used for writing a language. In other respects, it may be used more narrowly, to refer to prescriptive grammar only and excluding those aspects of a language's grammar that are not subject to variation or debate. Jeremy Butterfield claimed that, for non-linguists, \"Grammar is often a generic way of referring to any aspect of English that people object to. \"\nThe word grammar is derived from Greek (grammatikē technē), which means \"art of letters\", from (gramma), \"letter\", itself from (graphein), \"to draw, to write\". The same Greek root also appears in graphics, grapheme, and photograph.\nThe Babylonians made some early attempts at language description, but the first systematic grammars, of Sanskrit, originated in Iron Age India, with Yaska (6th century BC), Pāṇini (4th century BC) and his commentators Pingala (c. 200 BC), Katyayana, and Patanjali (2nd century BC). Tolkāppiyam, the earliest Tamil grammar, is mostly dated to before the 5th century AD. In the West, grammar emerged as a discipline in Hellenism from the 3rd century BC forward with authors like Rhyanus and Aristarchus of Samothrace, the oldest extant work being the Art of Grammar, attributed to Dionysius Thrax (c. 100 BC). Latin grammar developed by following Greek models from the 1st century BC, due to the work of authors such as Orbilius Pupillus, Remmius Palaemon, Marcus Valerius Probus, Verrius Flaccus, and Aemilius Asper. A grammar of Irish originated in the 7th century with the Auraicept na n-Éces. Arabic grammar emerged with Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali in the 7th century. The first treatises on Hebrew grammar appeared in the High Middle Ages, in the context of Mishnah (exegesis of the Hebrew Bible). The Karaite tradition originated in Abbasid Baghdad. The Diqduq (10th century) is one of the earliest grammatical commentaries on the Hebrew Bible. Ibn Barun in the 12th century compares the Hebrew language with Arabic in the Islamic grammatical tradition. Belonging to the trivium of the seven liberal arts, grammar was taught as a core discipline throughout the Middle Ages, following the influence of authors from Late Antiquity, such as Priscian. Treatment of vernaculars began gradually during the High Middle Ages, with isolated works such as the First Grammatical Treatise, but became influential only in the Renaissance and Baroque periods. In 1486, Antonio de Nebrija published Las introduciones Latinas contrapuesto el romance al Latin, and the first Spanish grammar, Gramática de la lengua castellana, in 1492. During the 16th-century Italian Renaissance, the Questione della lingua was the discussion on the status and ideal form of the Italian language, initiated by Dante's de vulgari eloquentia (Pietro Bembo, Prose della volgar lingua Venice 1525). The first grammar of Slovene language was written in 1583 by Adam Bohorič. Grammars of non-European languages began to be compiled for the purposes of evangelization and Bible translation from the 16th century onward, such as Grammatica o Arte de la Lengua General de los Indios de los Reynos del Perú, and a Quechua grammar by Fray Domingo de Santo Tomás. In 1643 there appeared Ivan Uzhevych's Grammatica sclavonica and, in 1762, the Short Introduction to English Grammar of Robert Lowth was also published. The Grammatisch-Kritisches Wörterbuch der hochdeutschen Mundart, a High German grammar in five volumes by Johann Christoph Adelung, appeared as early as 1774. From the latter part of the 18th century, grammar came to be understood as a subfield of the emerging discipline of modern linguistics. The Serbian grammar by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić arrived in 1814, while the Deutsche Grammatik of the Brothers Grimm was first published in 1818. The Comparative Grammar of Franz Bopp, the starting point of modern comparative linguistics, came out in 1833.\nGrammars evolve through usage and also due to separations of the human population. With the advent of written representations, formal rules about language usage tend to appear also. Formal grammars are codifications of usage that are developed by repeated documentation over time, and by observation as well. As the rules become established and developed, the prescriptive concept of grammatical correctness can arise. This often creates a discrepancy between contemporary usage and that which has been accepted, over time, as being correct. Linguists tend to view prescriptive grammars as having little justification beyond their authors' aesthetic tastes, although style guides may give useful advice about standard language employment, based on descriptions of usage in contemporary writings of the same language. Linguistic prescriptions also form part of the explanation for variation in speech, particularly variation in the speech of an individual speaker (an explanation, for example, for why some people say \"I didn't do nothing\", some say \"I didn't do anything\", and some say one or the other depending on social context). The formal study of grammar is an important part of education for children from a young age through advanced learning, though the rules taught in schools are not a \"grammar\" in the sense most linguists use the term, particularly as they are often prescriptive rather than descriptive. Constructed languages (also called planned languages or conlangs) are more common in the modern day than they used to be, although still extremely uncommon compared to natural languages. Many have been designed to aid human communication (for example, naturalistic Interlingua, schematic Esperanto, and the highly logic-compatible artificial language Lojban). Each of these languages has its own grammar. Syntax refers to the linguistic structure above the word level (e.g. how sentences are formed)—though without taking into account intonation, which is the domain of phonology. Morphology, by contrast, refers to structure at and below the word level (e.g. how compound words are formed), but above the level of individual sounds, which, like intonation, are in the domain of phonology. No clear line can be drawn, however, between syntax and morphology. Analytic languages use syntax to convey information that is encoded via inflection in synthetic languages. In other words, word order is not significant and morphology is highly significant in a purely synthetic language, whereas morphology is not significant and syntax is highly significant in an analytic language. Chinese and Afrikaans, for example, are highly analytic, and meaning is therefore very context-dependent. (Both do have some inflections, and have had more in the past; thus, they are becoming even less synthetic and more \"purely\" analytic over time.) Latin, which is highly synthetic, uses affixes and inflections to convey the same information that Chinese does with syntax. Because Latin words are quite (though not completely) self-contained, an intelligible Latin sentence can be made from elements that are placed in a largely arbitrary order. Latin has a complex affixation and simple syntax, while Chinese has the opposite.\nVarious \"grammar frameworks\" have been developed in theoretical linguistics since the mid-20th century, in particular under the influence of the idea of a \"universal grammar\" in the United States. Of these, the main divisions are:\nPrescriptive grammar is taught in primary and secondary school. The term \"grammar school\" historically refers to a school teaching Latin grammar to future Roman citizens, orators, and, later, Catholic priests. In its earliest form, \"grammar school\" referred to a school that taught students to read, scan, interpret, and declaim Greek and Latin poets (including Homer, Virgil, Euripides, Ennius, and others). These should not be confused with the related, albeit distinct, modern British grammar schools. A standard language is a particular dialect of a language that is promoted above other dialects in writing, education, and broadly speaking in the public sphere; it contrasts with vernacular dialects, which may be the objects of study in descriptive grammar but which are rarely taught prescriptively. The standardized \"first language\" taught in primary education may be subject to political controversy, because it may sometimes establish a standard defining nationality or ethnicity. Recently, efforts have begun to update grammar instruction in primary and secondary education. The primary focus has been to prevent the use of outdated prescriptive rules in favour of more accurate descriptive ones and to change perceptions about relative \"correctness\" of standard forms in comparison to non-standard dialects. The pre-eminence of Parisian French has reigned largely unchallenged throughout the history of modern French literature. Standard Italian is not based on the speech of the capital, Rome, but on the speech of Florence because of the influence, Florentines had on early Italian literature. Similarly, standard Spanish is not based on the speech of Madrid, but on that of educated speakers from more northerly areas like Castile and León (e.g. see Gramática de la lengua castellana). In Argentina and Uruguay the Spanish standard is based on the local dialects of Buenos Aires and Montevideo (Rioplatense Spanish). Portuguese has, for now, two official standards, respectively Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese. The Serbian language is divided in a similar way; Serbia and the Republika Srpska use their own separate standards. The existence of a third standard is a matter of controversy, some consider Montenegrin as a separate language, and some think it is merely another variety of Serbian. Norwegian has two standards, Bokmål and Nynorsk, the choice between which is subject to controversy: Each Norwegian municipality can declare one of the two its official language, or it can remain \"language neutral\". Nynorsk is endorsed by a minority of 27 percent of the municipalities. The main language used in primary schools normally follows the official language of its municipality and is decided by referendum within the local school district. Standard German emerged from the standardized chancellery use of High German in the 16th and 17th centuries. Until about 1800, it was almost entirely a written language, but now it is so widely spoken that most of the former German dialects are nearly extinct. Standard Chinese has official status as the standard spoken form of the Chinese language in the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (ROC) and the Republic of Singapore. Pronunciation of Standard Chinese is based on the local accent of Mandarin Chinese from Luanping, Chengde in Hebei Province near Beijing, while grammar and syntax are based on modern vernacular written Chinese. Modern Standard Arabic is directly based on Classical Arabic, the language of the Qur'an. The Hindustani language has two standards, Hindi and Urdu. In the United States, the Society for the Promotion of Good Grammar designated 4 March as National Grammar Day in 2008.\n\n","I took my love, I took it down, climbed a mountain and I turned around, and I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills 'til the landslide brought it down.\nOh, mirror in the sky, what is love?\nCan the child within my heart rise above?\nCan I sail through the changin' ocean tides?\nCan I handle the seasons of my life?\n\nWell, I've been afraid of changin' 'cause I've built my life around you.\nBut time makes you bolder even children get older, and I'm getting older, too.\n\nI took my love, I took it down, I climbed a mountain and I turned around and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills, well the landslide will bring it down.\nAnd if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills, well the landslide will bring it down.\nOh, the landslide will bring it down.\n\n","Article 1401: Scope and Coverage\n1.

Subject to Annex 1403.3, at such time as the United States permits commercial banks of another Party located in its territory to expand through subsidiaries or direct branches into substantially all of the United States market, the Parties shall review and assess market access provided by each Party in relation to the principles in paragraphs 1 and 2 with a view to adopting arrangements permitting investors of another Party to choose the juridical form of establishment of commercial banks.\n4. Each Party shall permit an investor of another Party that does not own or control a financial institution in the Party's territory to establish a financial institution in that territory.

No Party may adopt any measure restricting any type of cross-border trade in financial services by cross-border financial service providers of another Party that the Party permits on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, except to the extent set out in Section B of the Party's Schedule to Annex VII.\n2. Each Party shall permit persons located in its territory, and its nationals wherever located, to purchase financial services from cross-border financial service providers of another Party located in the territory of that other Party or of another Party. This obligation does not require a Party to permit such providers to do business or solicit in its territory. Subject to paragraph 1, each Party may define \"doing business\" and \"solicitation\" for purposes of this obligation.\n3. Without prejudice to other means of prudential regulation of cross-border trade in financial services, a Party may require the registration of cross-border financial service providers of another Party and of financial instruments.\n4. The Parties shall consult on future liberalization of cross-border trade in financial services as set out in Annex 1404.4.\nArticle 1405: National Treatment\n1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own investors, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments in financial institutions in its territory.\n2. Each Party shall accord to financial institutions of another Party and to investments of investors of another Party in financial institutions treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own financial institutions and to investments of its own investors in financial institutions, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments.\n3. Subject to Article 1404, where a Party permits the cross-border provision of a financial service it shall accord to the cross-border financial service providers of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own financial service providers, in like circumstances, with respect to the provision of such service.\n4. The treatment that a Party is required to accord under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 means, with respect to a measure of any state or province:\n\n(a) in the case of an investor of another Party with an investment in a financial institution, an investment of such investor in a financial institution, or a financial institution of such investor, located in a state or province, treatment no less favorable than the treatment accorded to an investor of the Party in a financial institution, an investment of such investor in a financial institution, or a financial institution of such investor, located in that state or province, in like circumstances; and\n(b) in any other case, treatment no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded to an investor of the Party in a financial institution, its financial institution or its investment in a financial institution, in like circumstances.\nFor greater certainty, in the case of an investor of another Party with investments in financial institutions or financial institutions of such investor, located in more than one state or province, the treatment required under subparagraph (a) means:\n\n(c) treatment of the investor that is no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded to an investor of the Party with an investment located in such states, or provinces in like circumstances; and\n(d) with respect to an investment of the investor in a financial institution or a financial institution of such investor, located in a state or province, treatment no less favorable than that accorded to an investment of an investor of the Party, or a financial institution of such investor, located in that state or province, in like circumstances.\n5. A Party's treatment of financial institutions and cross-border financial service providers of another Party, whether different or identical to that accorded to its own institutions or providers in like circumstances, is consistent with paragraphs 1 through 3 if the treatment affords equal competitive opportunities.\n6. A Party's treatment affords equal competitive opportunities if it does not disadvantage financial institutions and cross-border financial services providers of another Party in their ability to provide financial services as compared with the ability of the Party's own financial institutions and financial services providers to provide such services, in like circumstances.\n7. Differences in market share, profitability or size do not in themselves establish a denial of equal competitive opportunities, but such differences may be used as evidence regarding whether a Party's treatment affords equal competitive opportunities.\nArticle 1406: Most-Favored-Nation Treatment\n1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party, financial institutions of another Party, investments of investors in financial institutions and cross-border financial service providers of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords to the investors, financial institutions, investments of investors in financial institutions and cross-border financial service providers of any other Party or of a non-Party, in like circumstances.\n2. A Party may recognize prudential measures of another Party or of a non-Party in the application of measures covered by this Chapter. Such recognition may be:\n\n(a) accorded unilaterally;\n(b) achieved through harmonization or other means; or\n(c) based upon an agreement or arrangement with the other Party or non-Party.\n3. A Party according recognition of prudential measures under paragraph 2 shall provide adequate opportunity to another Party to demonstrate that circumstances exist in which there are or would be equivalent regulation, oversight, implementation of regulation, and if appropriate, procedures concerning the sharing of information between the Parties.\n4. Where a Party accords recognition of prudential measures under paragraph 2(c); and the circumstances set out in paragraph 3 exist, the Party shall provide adequate opportunity to another Party to negotiate accession to the agreement or arrangement, or to negotiate a comparable agreement or arrangement.\nArticle 1407: New Financial Services and Data Processing\n1. Each Party shall permit a financial institution of another Party to provide any new financial service of a type similar to those services that the Party permits its own financial institutions, in like circumstances, to provide under its domestic law. A Party may determine the institutional and juridical form through which the service may be provided and may require authorization for the provision of the service. Where such authorization is required, a decision shall be made within a reasonable time and the authorization may only be refused for prudential reasons.\n2. Each Party shall permit a financial institution of another Party to transfer information in electronic or other form, into and out of the Party's territory, for data processing where such processing is required in the ordinary course of business of such institution.\nArticle 1408: Senior Management and Boards of Directors\n1.

Articles 1403 through 1408 do not apply to any non-conforming measure that a Party adopts or maintains in accordance with Section B of its Schedule to Annex VII.\n3. Section C of each Party's Schedule to Annex VII sets out certain specific commitments by that Party.\n4. Where a Party has set out a reservation to Article 1102, 1103, 1202 or 1203 in its Schedule to Annex I, II, III or IV, the reservation shall be deemed to constitute a reservation to Article 1405 or 1406, as the case may be, to the extent that the measure, sector, subsector or activity set out in the reservation is covered by this Chapter.\nArticle 1410: Exceptions\n\n1. Nothing in this Part shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining reasonable measures for prudential reasons, such as:\n\n(a) the protection of investors, depositors, financial market participants, policyholders, policy claimants, or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial institution or cross-border financial service provider;\n(b) the maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions or cross-border financial service providers; and\n(c) ensuring the integrity and stability of a Party's financial system.\n2.

Article 1405 shall not apply to the granting by a Party to a financial institution of an exclusive right to provide a financial service referred to in Article 1401(3)(a).\n4. Notwithstanding Article 1109(1), (2) and (3), as incorporated into this Chapter, and without limiting the applicability of Article 1109(4), as incorporated into this Chapter, a Party may prevent or limit transfers by a financial institution or cross-border financial services provider to, or for the benefit of, an affiliate of or person related to such institution or provider, through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of measures relating to maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions or cross-border financial service providers. This paragraph does not prejudice any other provision of this Agreement that permits a Party to restrict transfers.\nArticle 1411: Transparency\n1.

The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit is used for culinary and non-culinary purposes throughout the world, primarily for its juice, which has both culinary and cleaning uses. The pulp and rind (zest) are also used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is about 5% to 6% citric acid, with a pH of around 2.2, giving it a sour taste. The distinctive sour taste of lemon juice makes it a key ingredient in drinks and foods such as lemonade and lemon meringue pie.\nThe origin of the lemon is unknown, though lemons are thought to have first grown in Assam (a region in northeast India), northern Burma or China. A study of the genetic origin of the lemon reported it to be hybrid between bitter orange (sour orange) and citron. Lemons entered Europe near southern Italy no later than the second century AD, during the time of Ancient Rome. However, they were not widely cultivated. They were later introduced to Persia and then to Iraq and Egypt around 700 AD. The lemon was first recorded in literature in a 10th-century Arabic treatise on farming, and was also used as an ornamental plant in early Islamic gardens. It was distributed widely throughout the Arab world and the Mediterranean region between 1000 and 1150. The first substantial cultivation of lemons in Europe began in Genoa in the middle of the 15th century. The lemon was later introduced to the Americas in 1493 when Christopher Columbus brought lemon seeds to Hispaniola on his voyages. Spanish conquest throughout the New World helped spread lemon seeds. It was mainly used as an ornamental plant and for medicine. In the 19th century, lemons were increasingly planted in Florida and California. In 1747, James Lind's experiments on seamen suffering from scurvy involved adding lemon juice to their diets, though vitamin C was not yet known. The origin of the word \"lemon\" may be Middle Eastern. The word draws from the Old French limon, then Italian limone, from the Arabic laymūn or līmūn, and from the Persian līmūn, a generic term for citrus fruit, which is a cognate of Sanskrit (nimbū, “lime”).\nThe 'Bonnie Brae' is oblong, smooth, thin-skinned, and seedless, mostly grown in San Diego County, USA. The 'Eureka' grows year-round and abundantly. This is the common supermarket lemon, also known as 'Four Seasons' (Quatre Saisons) because of its ability to produce fruit and flowers together throughout the year. This variety is also available as a plant to domestic customers. There is also a pink-fleshed Eureka lemon, with a green and yellow variegated outer skin. The 'Femminello St. Teresa', or 'Sorrento' is native to Italy. This fruit's zest is high in lemon oils. It is the variety traditionally used in the making of limoncello. The 'Meyer' is a cross between a lemon and possibly an orange or a mandarin, and was named after Frank N. Meyer, who first introduced it to the USA in 1908. Thin-skinned and slightly less acidic than the Lisbon and Eureka lemons, Meyer lemons require more care when shipping and are not widely grown on a commercial basis. Meyer lemons often mature to a yellow-orange color. They are slightly more frost-tolerant than other lemons. The 'Ponderosa' is more cold-sensitive than true lemons; the fruit are thick-skinned and very large. It is likely a citron-lemon hybrid. The 'Yen Ben' is an Australasian cultivar.\nLemons are a rich source of vitamin C, providing 64% of the Daily Value in a 100 g serving (table). Other essential nutrients, however, have insignificant content (table). Lemons contain numerous phytochemicals, including polyphenols, terpenes, and tannins. Lemon juice contains slightly more citric acid than lime juice (about 47 g/l), nearly twice the citric acid of grapefruit juice, and about five times the amount of citric acid found in orange juice.\nLemon juice, rind, and peel are used in a wide variety of foods and drinks. The whole lemon is used to make marmalade, lemon curd and lemon liqueur. Lemon slices and lemon rind are used as a garnish for food and drinks. Lemon zest, the grated outer rind of the fruit, is used to add flavor to baked goods, puddings, rice, and other dishes.\nLemon juice is used to make lemonade, soft drinks, and cocktails. It is used in marinades for fish, where its acid neutralizes amines in fish by converting them into nonvolatile ammonium salts, and meat, where the acid partially hydrolyzes tough collagen fibers, tenderizing the meat, but the low pH denatures the proteins, causing them to dry out when cooked. Lemon juice is frequently used in the United Kingdom to add to pancakes, especially on Shrove Tuesday. Lemon juice is also used as a short-term preservative on certain foods that tend to oxidize and turn brown after being sliced (enzymatic browning), such as apples, bananas, and avocados, where its acid denatures the enzymes.\nIn Morocco, lemons are preserved in jars or barrels of salt. The salt penetrates the peel and rind, softening them, and curing them so that they last almost indefinitely. The preserved lemon is used in a wide variety of dishes. Preserved lemons can also be found in Sicilian, Italian, Greek, and French dishes.\nThe leaves of the lemon tree are used to make a tea and for preparing cooked meats and seafoods.\nLemons were the primary commercial source of citric acid before the development of fermentation-based processes.\nThe juice of the lemon may be used for cleaning. A halved lemon dipped in salt or baking powder is used to brighten copper cookware. The acid dissolves the tarnish and the abrasives assist the cleaning. As a sanitary kitchen deodorizer the juice can deodorize, remove grease, bleach stains, and disinfect; when mixed with baking soda, it removes stains from plastic food storage containers. The oil of the lemon's peel also has various uses. It is used as a wood cleaner and polish, where its solvent property is employed to dissolve old wax, fingerprints, and grime. Lemon oil and orange oil are also used as a nontoxic insecticide treatment. A halved lemon is used as a finger moistener for those counting large amounts of bills, such as tellers and cashiers.\nLemon oil may be used in aromatherapy. Lemon oil aroma does not influence the human immune system, but may contribute to relaxation.\nOne educational science experiment involves attaching electrodes to a lemon and using it as a battery to produce electricity. Although very low power, several lemon batteries can power a small digital watch. These experiments also work with other fruits and vegetables. Lemon juice may be used as a simple invisible ink, developed by heat.\nLemons need a minimum temperature of around 7 C, so they are not hardy year round in temperate climates, but become hardier as they mature. Citrus require minimal pruning by trimming overcrowded branches, with the tallest branch cut back to encourage bushy growth. Throughout summer, pinching back tips of the most vigorous growth assures more abundant canopy development. As mature plants may produce unwanted, fast-growing shoots called ‘water shoots’, these are removed from the main branches at the bottom or middle of the plant. In cultivation in the UK, the cultivars ‘Meyer’ and ‘Variegata’ have gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).\nIn 2014, world production of lemons (data combined with limes) was 16.3 million tonnes. The top producers were India, Mexico, China, Argentina, and Brazil, collectively accounting for 59% of total production (table).\nMany plants taste or smell similar to lemons.\n\n","Article 1401: Scope and Coverage\n1.

Each Party shall accord to financial institutions of another Party and to investments of investors of another Party in financial institutions treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own financial institutions and to investments of its own investors in financial institutions, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments.\n3.

Each Party may, in accordance with this Agreement, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure, including any such measure relating to safety, the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, and any measure to ensure its enforcement or implementation.

An unnecessary obstacle to trade shall not be deemed to be created where:\n\n(a) the demonstrable purpose of the measure is to achieve a legitimate objective; and\n(b) the measure does not operate to exclude goods of another Party that meet that legitimate objective.\nArticle 905: Use of International Standards\n1. Each Party shall use, as a basis for its standards-related measures, relevant international standards or international standards whose completion is imminent, except where such standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means to fulfill its legitimate objectives, for example because of fundamental climatic, geographical, technological or infrastructural factors, scientific justification or the level of protection that the Party considers appropriate.\n2. A Party's standards-related measure that conforms to an international standard shall be presumed to be consistent with Article 904(3) and (4).\n3. Nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, from adopting, maintaining or applying any standards-related measure that results in a higher level of protection than would be achieved if the measure were based on the relevant international standard.\nArticle 906: Compatibility and Equivalence\n1. Recognizing the crucial role of standards-related measures in achieving legitimate objectives, the Parties shall, in accordance with this Chapter, work jointly to enhance the level of safety and of protection of human, animal and plant life and health, the environment and consumers.\n2. Without reducing the level of safety or of protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, without prejudice to the rights of any Party under this Chapter, and taking into account international standardization activities, the Parties shall, to the greatest extent practicable, make compatible their respective standards-related measures, so as to facilitate trade in a good or service between the Parties.\n3.

Each Party shall, wherever possible, accept the results of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in the territory of another Party, provided that it is satisfied that the procedure offers an assurance, equivalent to that provided by a procedure it conducts or a procedure conducted in its territory the results of which it accepts, that the relevant good or service complies with the applicable technical regulation or standard adopted or maintained in the Party's territory.\n7. Prior to accepting the results of a conformity assessment procedure pursuant to paragraph 6, and to enhance confidence in the continued reliability of each other's conformity assessment results, the Parties may consult on such matters as the technical competence of the conformity assessment bodies involved, including verified compliance with relevant international standards through such means as accreditation.\nArticle 907: Assessment of Risk\n1.

Where pursuant to Article 904(2) a Party establishes a level of protection that it considers appropriate and conducts an assessment of risk, it should avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions between similar goods or services in the level of protection it considers appropriate, where the distinctions:\n\n(a) result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against goods or service providers of another Party;\n(b) constitute a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties; or\n(c) discriminate between similar goods or services for the same use under the same conditions that pose the same level of risk and provide similar benefits.\n3. Where a Party conducting an assessment of risk determines that available scientific evidence or other information is insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a provisional technical regulation on the basis of available relevant information. The Party shall, within a reasonable period after information sufficient to complete the assessment of risk is presented to it, complete its assessment, review and, where appropriate, revise the provisional technical regulation in the light of that assessment.\nArticle 908: Conformity Assessment\n1. The Parties shall, further to Article 906 and recognizing the existence of substantial differences in the structure, organization and operation of conformity assessment procedures in their respective territories, make compatible those procedures to the greatest extent practicable.\n2. Recognizing that it should be to the mutual advantage of the Parties concerned and except as set out in Annex 908.2, each Party shall accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize conformity assessment bodies in the territory of another Party on terms no less favorable than those accorded to conformity assessment bodies in its territory.\n3. Each Party shall, with respect to its conformity assessment procedures:\n\n(a) not adopt or maintain any such procedure that is stricter, nor apply the procedure more strictly, than necessary to give it confidence that a good or a service conforms with an applicable technical regulation or standard, taking into account the risks that non-conformity would create;\n(b) initiate and complete the procedure as expeditiously as possible;\n(c) in accordance with Article 904(3), undertake processing of applications in non-discriminatory order;\n(d) publish the normal processing period for each such procedure or communicate the anticipated processing period to an applicant on request;\n(e) ensure that the competent body\n\n(i) on receipt of an application, promptly examines the completeness of the documentation and informs the applicant in a precise and complete manner of any deficiency,\n(ii) transmits to the applicant as soon as possible the results of the conformity assessment procedure in a form that is precise and complete so that the applicant may take any necessary corrective action,\n(iii) where the application is deficient, proceeds as far as practicable with the procedure where the applicant so requests, and\n(iv) informs the applicant, on request, of the status of the application and the reasons for any delay;\n(f) limit the information the applicant is required to supply to that necessary to conduct the procedure and to determine appropriate fees;\n(g) accord confidential or proprietary information arising from, or supplied in connection with, the conduct of the procedure for a good of another Party or for a service provided by a person of another Party\n\n(i) the same treatment as that for a good of the Party or a service provided by a person of the Party, and\n(ii) in any event, treatment that protects an applicant's legitimate commercial interests to the extent provided under the Party's law;\n(h) ensure that any fee it imposes for conducting the procedure is no higher for a good of another Party or a service provider of another Party than is equitable in relation to any such fee imposed for its like goods or service providers or for like goods or service providers of any other country, taking into account communication, transportation and other related costs;\n(i) ensure that the location of facilities at which a conformity assessment procedure is conducted does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent;\n(j) limit the procedure, for a good or service modified subsequent to a determination that the good or service conforms to the applicable technical regulation or standard, to that necessary to determine that the good or service continues to conform to the technical regulation or standard; and\n(k) limit any requirement regarding samples of a good to that which is reasonable, and ensure that the selection of samples does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent.\n4. Each Party shall apply, with such modifications as may be necessary, the relevant provisions of paragraph 3 to its approval procedures.\n5. Each Party shall, on request of another Party, take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to facilitate access in its territory for conformity assessment activities.\n6.

Each Party proposing to adopt or modify a standard or any conformity assessment procedure not otherwise considered to be a technical regulation shall, where an international standard relevant to the proposed measure does not exist or such measure is not substantially the same as an international standard, and where the measure may have a significant effect on the trade of the other Parties:\n\n(a) at an early appropriate stage, publish a notice and provide a notification of the type required in paragraph 1(a) and (b); and\n(b) observe paragraph (c) and (d).\n3. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure, with respect to a technical regulation of a state or provincial government other than a local government:\n\n(a) that, at an early appropriate stage, a notice and notification of the type required under paragraph 1(a) and (b) are made prior to their adoption; and\n(b) observance of paragraph (c) and (d).\n4. Where a Party considers it necessary to address an urgent problem relating to safety or to protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, it may omit any step set out in paragraph 1 or 3, provided that on adoption of a standards-related measure it shall:\n\n(a) immediately provide to the other Parties a notification of the type required under paragraph 1(b), including a brief description of the urgent problem;\n(b) provide a copy of the measure to any Party or interested person that so requests; and\n(c) without discrimination, allow other Parties and interested persons to make comments in writing, and shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the comments and the results of the discussions into account.\n5.

The sledge was shaped like a great golden\nswan, and between the swan’s wings lay the little Princess herself.  Her\nlong ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny\ncap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she\nhad always lived.  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets\nall the people wondered.  “She is like a white rose!” they cried, and\nthey threw down flowers on her from the balconies.\n\nAt the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had\ndreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he\nsank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.\n\n“Your picture was beautiful,” he murmured, “but you are more beautiful\nthan your picture”; and the little Princess blushed.\n\n“She was like a white rose before,” said a young Page to his neighbour,\n“but she is like a red rose now”; and the whole Court was delighted.\n\nFor the next three days everybody went about saying, “White rose, Red\nrose, Red rose, White rose”; and the King gave orders that the Page’s\nsalary was to be doubled.  As he received no salary at all this was not\nof much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly\npublished in the Court Gazette.\n\nWhen the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  It was a\nmagnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand\nunder a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.  Then\nthere was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and\nPrincess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear\ncrystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips\ntouched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.\n\n“It’s quite clear that they love each other,” said the little Page, “as\nclear as crystal!” and the King doubled his salary a second time.  “What\nan honour!” cried all the courtiers.\n\nAfter the banquet there was to be a Ball.  The bride and bridegroom were\nto dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the\nflute.  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so,\nbecause he was the King.  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never\nquite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for,\nwhatever he did, everybody cried out, “Charming! charming!”\n\nThe last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be\nlet off exactly at midnight.  The little Princess had never seen a\nfirework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal\nPyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.\n\n“What are fireworks like?” she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she\nwas walking on the terrace.\n\n“They are like the Aurora Borealis,” said the King, who always answered\nquestions that were addressed to other people, “only much more natural.\nI prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to\nappear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.  You must\ncertainly see them.”\n\nSo at the end of the King’s garden a great stand had been set up, and as\nsoon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place,\nthe fireworks began to talk to each other.\n\n“The world is certainly very beautiful,” cried a little Squib.  “Just\nlook at those yellow tulips.  Why! if they were real crackers they could\nnot be lovelier.  I am very glad I have travelled.  Travel improves the\nmind wonderfully, and does away with all one’s prejudices.”\n\n“The King’s garden is not the world, you foolish squib,” said a big Roman\nCandle; “the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days\nto see it thoroughly.”\n\n“Any place you love is the world to you,” exclaimed a pensive Catherine\nWheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided\nherself on her broken heart; “but love is not fashionable any more, the\npoets have killed it.  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed\nthem, and I am not surprised.  True love suffers, and is silent.  I\nremember myself once—But it is no matter now.  Romance is a thing of the\npast.”\n\n“Nonsense!” said the Roman Candle, “Romance never dies.  It is like the\nmoon, and lives for ever.  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love\neach other very dearly.  I heard all about them this morning from a\nbrown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as\nmyself, and knew the latest Court news.”\n\nBut the Catherine Wheel shook her head.  “Romance is dead, Romance is\ndead, Romance is dead,” she murmured.  She was one of those people who\nthink that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times,\nit becomes true in the end.\n\nSuddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.\n\nIt came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end\nof a long stick.  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as\nto attract attention.\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine\nWheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, “Romance is dead.”\n\n“Order! order!” cried out a Cracker.  He was something of a politician,\nand had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew\nthe proper Parliamentary expressions to use.\n\n“Quite dead,” whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.\n\nAs soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and\nbegan.  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating\nhis memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he\nwas talking.  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.\n\n“How fortunate it is for the King’s son,” he remarked, “that he is to be\nmarried on the very day on which I am to be let off.  Really, if it had\nbeen arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him;\nbut, Princes are always lucky.”\n\n“Dear me!” said the little Squib, “I thought it was quite the other way,\nand that we were to be let off in the Prince’s honour.”\n\n“It may be so with you,” he answered; “indeed, I have no doubt that it\nis, but with me it is different.  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come\nof remarkable parents.  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel\nof her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.  When she made her\ngreat public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went\nout, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink\nstars.  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very\nbest gunpowder.  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French\nextraction.  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would\nnever come down again.  He did, though, for he was of a kindly\ndisposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden\nrain.  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering\nterms.  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic\nart.”\n\n“Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,” said a Bengal Light; “I know it is\nPyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.”\n\n“Well, I said Pylotechnic,” answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of\nvoice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to\nbully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of\nsome importance.\n\n“I was saying,” continued the Rocket, “I was saying—What was I saying?”\n\n“You were talking about yourself,” replied the Roman Candle.\n\n“Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was\nso rudely interrupted.  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind,\nfor I am extremely sensitive.  No one in the whole world is so sensitive\nas I am, I am quite sure of that.”\n\n“What is a sensitive person?” said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.\n\n“A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other\npeople’s toes,” answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the\nCracker nearly exploded with laughter.\n\n“Pray, what are you laughing at?” inquired the Rocket; “I am not\nlaughing.”\n\n“I am laughing because I am happy,” replied the Cracker.\n\n“That is a very selfish reason,” said the Rocket angrily.  “What right\nhave you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others.  In fact, you\nshould be thinking about me.  I am always thinking about myself, and I\nexpect everybody else to do the same.  That is what is called sympathy.\nIt is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.  Suppose,\nfor instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that\nwould be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy\nagain, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I\nknow he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the\nimportance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.”\n\n“If you want to give pleasure to others,” cried the Roman Candle, “you\nhad better keep yourself dry.”\n\n“Certainly,” exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits;\n“that is only common sense.”\n\n“Common sense, indeed!” said the Rocket indignantly; “you forget that I\nam very uncommon, and very remarkable.  Why, anybody can have common\nsense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination,\nfor I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as\nbeing quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no\none here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for\nmyself, I don’t care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is\nthe consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this\nis a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any\nhearts.  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and\nPrincess had not just been married.”\n\n“Well, really,” exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, “why not?  It is a most\njoyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the\nstars all about it.  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about\nthe pretty bride.”\n\n“Ah! what a trivial view of life!” said the Rocket; “but it is only what\nI expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why,\nperhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there\nis a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little\nfair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps\nsome day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may\ngo to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall\ninto the deep river and be drowned.  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor\npeople, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall\nnever get over it.”\n\n“But they have not lost their only son,” said the Roman Candle; “no\nmisfortune has happened to them at all.”\n\n“I never said that they had,” replied the Rocket; “I said that they\nmight.  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying\nanything more about the matter.  I hate people who cry over spilt milk.\nBut when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very\nmuch affected.”\n\n“You certainly are!” cried the Bengal Light.  “In fact, you are the most\naffected person I ever met.”\n\n“You are the rudest person I ever met,” said the Rocket, “and you cannot\nunderstand my friendship for the Prince.”\n\n“Why, you don’t even know him,” growled the Roman Candle.\n\n“I never said I knew him,” answered the Rocket.  “I dare say that if I\nknew him I should not be his friend at all.  It is a very dangerous thing\nto know one’s friends.”\n\n“You had really better keep yourself dry,” said the Fire-balloon.  “That\nis the important thing.”\n\n“Very important for you, I have no doubt,” answered the Rocket, “but I\nshall weep if I choose”; and he actually burst into real tears, which\nflowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little\nbeetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were\nlooking for a nice dry spot to live in.\n\n“He must have a truly romantic nature,” said the Catherine Wheel, “for he\nweeps when there is nothing at all to weep about”; and she heaved a deep\nsigh, and thought about the deal box.\n\nBut the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept\nsaying, “Humbug! humbug!” at the top of their voices.  They were\nextremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called\nit humbug.\n\nThen the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to\nshine, and a sound of music came from the palace.\n\nThe Prince and Princess were leading the dance.  They danced so\nbeautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and\nwatched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.\n\nThen ten o’clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the\nlast stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King\nsent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.\n\n“Let the fireworks begin,” said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made\na low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.  He had six\nattendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a\nlong pole.\n\nIt was certainly a magnificent display.\n\nWhizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.\nBoom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the\nplace, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  “Good-bye,”\ncried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.\nBang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves\nimmensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.\nHe was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best\nthing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it\nwas of no use.  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak,\nexcept with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers\nwith blossoms of fire.  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little\nPrincess laughed with pleasure.\n\n“I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,” said the\nRocket; “no doubt that is what it means,” and he looked more supercilious\nthan ever.\n\nThe next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.  “This is evidently\na deputation,” said the Rocket; “I will receive them with becoming\ndignity” so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if\nhe were thinking about some very important subject.  But they took no\nnotice of him at all till they were just going away.  Then one of them\ncaught sight of him.  “Hallo!” he cried, “what a bad rocket!” and he\nthrew him over the wall into the ditch.\n\n“BAD Rocket?  BAD Rocket?” he said, as he whirled through the air;\n“impossible!  GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.  BAD and GRAND\nsound very much the same, indeed they often are the same”; and he fell\ninto the mud.\n\n“It is not comfortable here,” he remarked, “but no doubt it is some\nfashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my\nhealth.  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require\nrest.”\n\nThen a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat,\nswam up to him.\n\n“A new arrival, I see!” said the Frog.  “Well, after all there is nothing\nlike mud.  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.  Do\nyou think it will be a wet afternoon?  I am sure I hope so, but the sky\nis quite blue and cloudless.  What a pity!”\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket, and he began to cough.\n\n“What a delightful voice you have!” cried the Frog.  “Really it is quite\nlike a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the\nworld.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck\npond close by the farmer’s house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.\nIt is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact,\nit was only yesterday that I heard the farmer’s wife say to her mother\nthat she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is\nmost gratifying to find oneself so popular.”\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket angrily.  He was very much annoyed that he\ncould not get a word in.\n\n“A delightful voice, certainly,” continued the Frog; “I hope you will\ncome over to the duck-pond.  I am off to look for my daughters.  I have\nsix beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He\nis a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off\nthem.  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I\nassure you.”\n\n“Conversation, indeed!” said the Rocket.  “You have talked the whole time\nyourself.  That is not conversation.”\n\n“Somebody must listen,” answered the Frog, “and I like to do all the\ntalking myself.  It saves time, and prevents arguments.”\n\n“But I like arguments,” said the Rocket.\n\n“I hope not,” said the Frog complacently.  “Arguments are extremely\nvulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.\nGood-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little\nFrog swam away.\n\n“You are a very irritating person,” said the Rocket, “and very ill-bred.\nI hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to\ntalk about oneself, as I do.  It is what I call selfishness, and\nselfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my\ntemperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.  In fact, you\nshould take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.\nNow that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I\nam going back to Court almost immediately.  I am a great favourite at\nCourt; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my\nhonour.  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a\nprovincial.”\n\n“There is no good talking to him,” said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on\nthe top of a large brown bulrush; “no good at all, for he has gone away.”\n\n“Well, that is his loss, not mine,” answered the Rocket.  “I am not going\nto stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.  I like\nhearing myself talk.  It is one of my greatest pleasures.  I often have\nlong conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I\ndon’t understand a single word of what I am saying.”\n\n“Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,” said the Dragon-fly;\nand he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.\n\n“How very silly of him not to stay here!” said the Rocket.  “I am sure\nthat he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.  However,\nI don’t care a bit.  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some\nday”; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.\n\nAfter some time a large White Duck swam up to him.  She had yellow legs,\nand webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her\nwaddle.\n\n“Quack, quack, quack,” she said.  “What a curious shape you are!  May I\nask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?”\n\n“It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,” answered\nthe Rocket, “otherwise you would know who I am.  However, I excuse your\nignorance.  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable\nas oneself.  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up\ninto the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain.”\n\n“I don’t think much of that,” said the Duck, “as I cannot see what use it\nis to any one.  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw\na cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that\nwould be something.”\n\n“My good creature,” cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, “I\nsee that you belong to the lower orders.  A person of my position is\nnever useful.  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than\nsufficient.  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least\nof all with such industries as you seem to recommend.  Indeed, I have\nalways been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who\nhave nothing whatever to do.”\n\n“Well, well,” said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and\nnever quarrelled with any one, “everybody has different tastes.  I hope,\nat any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here.”\n\n“Oh! dear no,” cried the Rocket.  “I am merely a visitor, a distinguished\nvisitor.  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.  There is\nneither society here, nor solitude.  In fact, it is essentially suburban.\nI shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make\na sensation in the world.”\n\n“I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,” remarked the Duck;\n“there are so many things that need reforming.  Indeed, I took the chair\nat a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning\neverything that we did not like.  However, they did not seem to have much\neffect.  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.”\n\n“I am made for public life,” said the Rocket, “and so are all my\nrelations, even the humblest of them.  Whenever we appear we excite great\nattention.  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will\nbe a magnificent sight.  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and\ndistracts one’s mind from higher things.”\n\n“Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are!” said the Duck; “and\nthat reminds me how hungry I feel”: and she swam away down the stream,\nsaying, “Quack, quack, quack.”\n\n“Come back! come back!” screamed the Rocket, “I have a great deal to say\nto you”; but the Duck paid no attention to him.  “I am glad that she has\ngone,” he said to himself, “she has a decidedly middle-class mind”; and\nhe sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the\nloneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came\nrunning down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots.\n\n“This must be the deputation,” said the Rocket, and he tried to look very\ndignified.\n\n“Hallo!” cried one of the boys, “look at this old stick!  I wonder how it\ncame here”; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.\n\n“OLD Stick!” said the Rocket, “impossible!  GOLD Stick, that is what he\nsaid.  Gold Stick is very complimentary.  In fact, he mistakes me for one\nof the Court dignitaries!”\n\n“Let us put it into the fire!” said the other boy, “it will help to boil\nthe kettle.”\n\nSo they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit\nthe fire.\n\n“This is magnificent,” cried the Rocket, “they are going to let me off in\nbroad day-light, so that every one can see me.”\n\n“We will go to sleep now,” they said, “and when we wake up the kettle\nwill be boiled”; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.\n\nThe Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.  At last,\nhowever, the fire caught him.\n\n“Now I am going off!” he cried, and he made himself very stiff and\nstraight.  “I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher\nthan the moon, much higher than the sun.  In fact, I shall go so high\nthat—”\n\nFizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.\n\n“Delightful!” he cried, “I shall go on like this for ever.  What a\nsuccess I am!”\n\nBut nobody saw him.\n\nThen he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.\n\n“Now I am going to explode,” he cried.  “I shall set the whole world on\nfire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for\na whole year.”  And he certainly did explode.  Bang! Bang! Bang! went the\ngunpowder.  There was no doubt about it.\n\nBut nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound\nasleep.\n\nThen all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the\nback of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.\n\n“Good heavens!” cried the Goose.  “It is going to rain sticks”; and she\nrushed into the water.\n\n“I knew I should create a great sensation,” gasped the Rocket, and he\nwent out.\n\n","\nWell, I have received much encouragement to relate my experiences on Ecstasy, so here is an attempt...\n\nI was told almost a week in advance that I might have the opportunity to try Ecstasy with the young lady who acted as a guide for my first LSD trip. We were to meet at a given tube station not far from the nightclub where the experimentation would take place.\n\nI was not easy about trying a new psychedelic in a crowded place, realizing this could have been difficult to handle with LSD. But there lay the opportunity and I just hoped to have enough mental control (practice of Yoga helping) if things got tight.\n\nI had read about MDMA in Peter Stafford's Psychedelics Encyclopaedia, but was aware E's are not very often pure MDMA. In addition, the book had stayed at home and my memory of its contents had faded somewhat. So I scanned the net for an Ecstasy FAQ and read that, also reading whatever current reports of the experience were posted on alt.drugs.\n\nQuite strangely, that was also the week my father decided to give me a hysterical account of some absurd and manipulatively badly written article in a Swiss newspaper depicting the dreadful and possessive evils of the Love Pill. He knows I have profound interest in altered consciousness and its chemical gateways, but not what I'm up to in my spare time...\n\nAnyway, I psyched myself up all week for the event, and when the Saturday evening came, I left a little note on my desk explaining that if I was unlucky that night, the Quest had been worth it.\n\nAs soon as we entered the nightclub, we went upstairs to the dance floor. An immense room with drapes hanging off all walls, a screen with a permanent slide of Planet Earth on it and countless balloons floating all around.\n\nSitting in a corner of the stage, I was handed my 2/3 of a White Dove pill. I insisted on chewing it to taste it - I wanted some intimate contact with the substance I was about to share my mind with. Tasted awful. Very chemical. That made me laugh, especially looking at the face of my companion who had agreed to bite into it too. We washed the taste down with gulps from the traditional raver's water bottle, as our supplier explained to us a few of the basics and possible initial effects.\n\n'If you feel funny, get up and dance.' she had said.\n\nSure enough, about 25 minutes later, I was feeling slightly uncomfortable. Stomach ? Mind ? I wasn't sure. From feeling quite talkative I went to being rather silent and reserved. So I got up and began to jiggle about. That felt a whole lot better.\n\nI was soon joined by the other Ecstasy-newbie who commented that nothing was happening to her.\n\n'I feel weird', I said.\n\n'Keep dancing' our supplier repeated, she too waiting for her E to kick in.\n\nMinutes later I experienced a rush to the head - I felt for a few seconds that I was really going to lose it, and had a vision of myself huddled in a corner, crying for hours. Damn, just my luck I thought, a bad trip on the first one. I literally felt as if my mind was going to black out. No way, I thought, no way. My dad talks WOsD propaganda and I'm not having a bad trip. I quickly searched for my companions on the stage and got closer to them. I danced more energetically, trying to get into the music.\n\nSeconds later a most unbelievable surge of energy and gentle warmth rushed through my body. It was so brutally intense, all I could do for several minutes was inhale and let the breath come out as one long howl of indescriptible joy. Many around me joined in. It seemed as though half the stage was just hollering in joint ecstasy.\n\nEcstasy. The perfect word. No other could have described what I was experiencing right then and there. Beyond words. The entire message was contained in a scream and the most intense smile my face had displayed in ages.\n\nOur supplier bounded up to us asking 'are you OK ? Have you eased up both of you ? You were rather tense'. I just grinned my face off.\n\n'I feel like hugging everybody' I shouted.\n\n'Then DO !' she yelled, flinging herself around my neck. Geez, that felt so GOOD ! Hugging was the most rewarding, comforting and uplifting experience ! This, for a person such as myself, usually quite conscious of personal space and physical contact with strangers, was a truly fascinating discovery.\n\nThe music too was surrounding me in trance-like comfort. The sound spoke to every nerve in my body. This is the synergy between dance, mind and rythmic signatures Terrence McKenna was on about, I thought. Wow. I could enjoy the 'Here and Now' - any time a thought of something unpleasant from the world would arise, I could look at it without stress, then gently push it out of my mind. It didn't matter that I had a project and exams. This state was pure, free, uninhibited.\n\nSpeaking to people in the chill-out room was bliss. I wanted everybody to be OK, I wanted to know their names, how many times they came here, what they were on... They were all so friendly.\n\nOne of them asked me 'You're all loved up, right ?'. I answered with the ecstatic grin. 'It's their first E' he was told. He then got up, opened his arms wide, and gave me a big hug. There was something so pure and brotherly about the whole atmosphere, it was overwhelming.\n\nI noticed all the described effects : brighter lights and colours, increased physical energy yet great calm, strong empathy and forgiveness for agressive behaviour, merging with the music to a trance state...\n\n'Beware of inappropriate emotional bonding', I had read. Damn, that's what held me back from interacting more fully with an unusually pretty girl who seemed to want to dance with me. As I noticed she was looking into my eyes and half turning to face me, I felt my heartbeat pound away. Another amazing wave of warmth shot up through my stomach to the top of my head. I felt my entire body vibrating with pleasure. I was on E and I was being turned on.\n\nI just looked into her eyes. I was confused by the intensity of the attraction, and uncertain how much of this was real. I needed a nod from a friend to go ahead, or something like that.\n\nThe nod never came. But I learned something really valuable there. Several years ago I got screwed up by a strong bondage with a girl. She moved away, and sure enough some predator attracted by her beauty seduced her. Though she chucked him away fast, that was the end for us. I had never been able to start another relationship with a girl since. I would miss any cue girls would send out to me, or even turn away from them, frightened. That Saturday night, Ecstasy cleared me from this emotional hangup. On the way down, I became introspective and meditative, and figured out what had been inhibiting me from falling in love again. This made me feel a great weight had just left my conscience, and I shared this feeling with friends immediately. I was once more free to love.\n\nSounds dramatic, I know. But this realization was deep, complete and liberating. LSD had freed my mind from some of its shackles, Ecstasy was freeing my feelings.\n\nThere would be so much more to say. But if you've read this far, I won't abuse your patience.\n\nWhat remains from the first experience is this emotional freedom, this feeling for Compassion (I now have a much better notion of what Buddha or Christ seemed to be preaching), and an increased ability to tune in to the structures and messages of music. On a more subtle level, I find it easier to initiate conversation with people and can cope better with aimless talk about this or that. I can also pick out almost anybody in a nightclub who is on E ! A real sharing and compassionate bunch - if a complete stranger happily offers you water, a spliff or a Vicks inhaler, I give you one guess as to what he's swallowed. Check the intense smile on his face, too.\n\nI have had only two more experiences with Ecstasy since.\n\nOn one occasion I met a really interesting group on the dance floor, winding up back at their place smoking spliff and playing video games, with a good bed for the night ! It also confirmed the return of my ability to interact with girls without hangups.\n\nOn the second occasion, I had twenty minutes of deeply mystical feeling ('I feel I'm talking to Jesus' I told my friend - this being from an agnostic). I also had a blinding moment in which I felt intensely how deeply important my friends are to me and how far beyond ordinary bonds our friendship goes.\n\nSo for whoever is going to try Ecstasy : aside from the usual drink-lots-of-water-and-wear-loose-clothing advice, prepare for times of howling beauty and buzzing interactions. Remember you can look at personal problems in a warm detached manner and maybe solve emotional history problems. And prepare for the ultimate experiences in dancing. \n\n","Originally written by Doty Abrams Transcribed by Mindy Mattingly Phillips\nOk. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!\nSo how did everything go?\nOh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.\nWell, we've gotta go.\nOk.\nSUSAN:\nOh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.\nOh, you and me?\nUh, no, Susan and me.\nThe other us.\nOk.\nWe're uh, we're getting married.\nAs in, \"I now pronounce you wife and wife\" married?\nAnyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.\nWhy wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.\nLook I just thought that...\nNo no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!\nIs your finger caught in that chair?\nMmm hmmm.\nWant us to go?\nUh-huh.\nThis is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.\nIt really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..\nYes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.\nROSS, CHANDLER & JOEY: Yes!\nThey want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?\nWould it matter?\nOh, you are so great! Thank you!\nAre you really not going?\nI am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?\nThey love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.\nIf you wanna call that a reason.\nWho's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.\nRoss, I thought you were over this.\nLook, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.\nHey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.\nDid I miss it? Did I miss it?\nNo, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.\nWhoa, she's pretty.\nYeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.\nI'm sorry, what?\nWhat?\nIt's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.\nOh, ok.\nThere's my scene, there's my scene. \"Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.\nIs she gonna be all right?\nI'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.\nNice!\nThat's great!\nExcellent!\nFor a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.\nThat is so good! Do it again!\nAll right, all right. \"Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!\"\nThat's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.\nNo no, that's me.\nOh, yeah.\nOh, hello.\nOh, thanks. I couldn't uh...\nIs everything ok?\nUm, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.\nOh my god.\nThat's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.\nYeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.\nOh, honey.\nYeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, \"ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage.\" Little did she know God was thinking, \"Ok, but that's it.\" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.\nWhat do you mean?\nI think it went into me.\nGod, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.\nWell, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.\nOk, who ordered what?\nOh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.\nYes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?\nOh god.\nI can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.\nI know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?\nTalk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.\nUh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?\nI don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!\nThere she is.\nMom!\nSweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.\nPretty much.\nMonica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.\nThis is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.\nOh hello, Ross.\nHi, Mrs. Green.\nSo, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?\nOh Mom!\nIf you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.\nBelieve me, sometimes that happens.\nThis is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.\nReally?\nYes.\nI know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.\nPheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?\nI don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?\nOh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.\nYeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.\nYou have some life here, sweetie.\nI know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?\nI do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.\nFor...me.\nWell, not just for you.\nWell, what do you mean?\nI'm uh, considering leaving your father.\nAll right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.\nOh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.\nWhy? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.\nAnd you had no idea they weren't getting along?\nNone.\nThey didn't fight a lot?\nNo! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?\nIn my day, divorce was not an option.\nHey, look who's up.\nI just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.\nIs there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.\nWell, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?\nYou know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.\nThat's him.\nDamn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.\nMR A: Phoebe?\nYes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.\nMR A: Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.\nUm, do you wanna sit?\nMR A: Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?\nI don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.\nMR A: You're saying, my wife is in you?\nYeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?\nMR A: Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.\nEverything?\nMR A: Everything.\nWhoa, that's a lot of stuff.\nMR A: Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.\nI'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.\nMR A: Worth a shot, huh?\nLook at this.\nThese are from Halloween three years ago.\nOh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?\nNo, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.\nUm, you guys, you know when I said before, \"thank you, but I don't really need your help\"?\nActually, what I think you said was, \"don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.\"\nReally? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.\nHey, Mon, you want some help?\nIf you want.\nHey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.\nShe's still with you?\nYeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.\nThis is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?\nGod!\nAll right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.\nThat's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?\nOh! What's new in sex?\nThe only man I've ever been with is your father.\nI'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.\nI mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.\nOh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?\nNo.\nYou want me to talk you out of it?\nNo.\nThen what? What do you want?\nI guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.\nWhy on earth would I understand this?\nYou didn't marry your Barry. I did.\nOh.\nAll right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!\nMonica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.\nJoey, speed it up!\nI'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!\nMonica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.\nDo you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?\nSir! No sir!\nAll right, you!\nNo. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.\nAll right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called \"pigs in Ross\". All right, ball the melon.\nHey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.\nHi.\nHow's it going?\nIt's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.\nFine, whatever.\nWhat's the matter?\nNothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.\nWhat?\nYou're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.\nCarol, what's the matter? What happened?\nMy parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.\nOh my god.\nI mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.\nIt's ok. I'm sorry.\nAnd then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.\nI uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.\nYou do?\nLook, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.\nOf course I do.\nWell then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.\nYou're right. Of course you're right.\nSo we're back on?\nWe're back on.\nYou heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.\nIt just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.\nWell now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.\nButterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.\nThank you.\nAny time.\nRoss.\nYou know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.\nWhoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.\nWould you look at them?\nYeah, can't help but.\nI wrapped those bad boys.\nI miss Rose.\nOh, yeah?\nI know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.\nYou know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?\nOk, that's so nice.Hey, Mom? Having fun?\nOh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.\nThere's more alcohol, right?\nHow you doin'?\nOk.\nYou did a good thing today.\nYeah.\nYou wanna dance?\nNo, that's fine.\nCome on. I'll let you lead.\nOk.Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?\nWell, Mon, I was married.\nYeah, me, too, technically.\nI had a wedding.\nAll right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.\nI got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?\nIsn't Ben in this?\nOh, yeah!\n","HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy\nPrince.  He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes\nhe had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his\nsword-hilt.\n\nHe was very much admired indeed.  “He is as beautiful as a weathercock,”\nremarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for\nhaving artistic tastes; “only not quite so useful,” he added, fearing\nlest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\n\n“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince?” asked a sensible mother of her\nlittle boy who was crying for the moon.  “The Happy Prince never dreams\nof crying for anything.”\n\n“I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,” muttered a\ndisappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\n\n“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came out\nof the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white\npinafores.\n\n“How do you know?” said the Mathematical Master, “you have never seen\none.”\n\n“Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the\nMathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not\napprove of children dreaming.\n\nOne night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had\ngone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was\nin love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring\nas he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so\nattracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\n\n“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at\nonce, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her,\ntouching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was\nhis courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\n\n“It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; “she has\nno money, and far too many relations”; and indeed the river was quite\nfull of Reeds.  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.\n\nAfter they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love.\n“She has no conversation,” he said, “and I am afraid that she is a\ncoquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.”  And certainly,\nwhenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.  “I\nadmit that she is domestic,” he continued, “but I love travelling, and my\nwife, consequently, should love travelling also.”\n\n“Will you come away with me?” he said finally to her; but the Reed shook\nher head, she was so attached to her home.\n\n“You have been trifling with me,” he cried.  “I am off to the Pyramids.\nGood-bye!” and he flew away.\n\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.  “Where\nshall I put up?” he said; “I hope the town has made preparations.”\n\nThen he saw the statue on the tall column.\n\n“I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a fine position, with plenty of\nfresh air.”  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.\n\n“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to himself as he looked round,\nand he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under\nhis wing a large drop of water fell on him.  “What a curious thing!” he\ncried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear\nand bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is\nreally dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her\nselfishness.”\n\nThen another drop fell.\n\n“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?” he said; “I\nmust look for a good chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away.\n\nBut before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up,\nand saw—Ah! what did he see?\n\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were\nrunning down his golden cheeks.  His face was so beautiful in the\nmoonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.\n\n“Who are you?” he said.\n\n“I am the Happy Prince.”\n\n“Why are you weeping then?” asked the Swallow; “you have quite drenched\nme.”\n\n“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue, “I did not\nknow what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where\nsorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my\ncompanions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great\nHall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask\nwhat lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers\ncalled me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be\nhappiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have\nset me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery\nof my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but\nweep.”\n\n“What! is he not solid gold?” said the Swallow to himself.  He was too\npolite to make any personal remarks out loud.\n\n“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away in a\nlittle street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and\nthrough it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and\nworn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she\nis a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for\nthe loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next\nCourt-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying\nill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing\nto give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little\nSwallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet\nare fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow.  “My friends are flying up\nand down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.  Soon they\nwill go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.  The King is there\nhimself in his painted coffin.  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and\nembalmed with spices.  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and\nhis hands are like withered leaves.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and\nthe mother so sad.”\n\n“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow.  “Last summer, when I\nwas staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons,\nwho were always throwing stones at me.  They never hit me, of course; we\nswallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family\nfamous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.”\n\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.\n“It is very cold here,” he said; “but I will stay with you for one night,\nand be your messenger.”\n\n“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince.\n\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword, and\nflew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\n\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were\nsculptured.  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.  A\nbeautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.  “How wonderful\nthe stars are,” he said to her, “and how wonderful is the power of love!”\n\n“I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,” she answered;\n“I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the\nseamstresses are so lazy.”\n\nHe passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of\nthe ships.  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining\nwith each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.  At last he\ncame to the poor house and looked in.  The boy was tossing feverishly on\nhis bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.  In he\nhopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble.\nThen he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy’s forehead with his\nwings.  “How cool I feel,” said the boy, “I must be getting better”; and\nhe sank into a delicious slumber.\n\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had\ndone.  “It is curious,” he remarked, “but I feel quite warm now, although\nit is so cold.”\n\n“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince.  And the\nlittle Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.  Thinking always\nmade him sleepy.\n\nWhen day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  “What a\nremarkable phenomenon,” said the Professor of Ornithology as he was\npassing over the bridge.  “A swallow in winter!”  And he wrote a long\nletter about it to the local newspaper.  Every one quoted it, it was full\nof so many words that they could not understand.\n\n“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at\nthe prospect.  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time\non top of the church steeple.  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped,\nand said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger!” so he enjoyed\nhimself very much.\n\nWhen the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  “Have you any\ncommissions for Egypt?” he cried; “I am just starting.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me one night longer?”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow.  “To-morrow my friends\nwill fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among\nthe bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All\nnight long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he\nutters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions\ncome down to the water’s edge to drink.  They have eyes like green\nberyls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away across the\ncity I see a young man in a garret.  He is leaning over a desk covered\nwith papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered\nviolets.  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a\npomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.  He is trying to finish a\nplay for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any\nmore.  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.”\n\n“I will wait with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, who really had\na good heart.  “Shall I take him another ruby?”\n\n“Alas!  I have no ruby now,” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that I\nhave left.  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of\nIndia a thousand years ago.  Pluck out one of them and take it to him.\nHe will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish\nhis play.”\n\n“Dear Prince,” said the Swallow, “I cannot do that”; and he began to\nweep.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\nyou.”\n\nSo the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and flew away to the\nstudent’s garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in\nthe roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room.  The young man\nhad his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the\nbird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying\non the withered violets.\n\n“I am beginning to be appreciated,” he cried; “this is from some great\nadmirer.  Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy.\n\nThe next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of\na large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold\nwith ropes.  “Heave a-hoy!” they shouted as each chest came up.  “I am\ngoing to Egypt”! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon\nrose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\n\n“I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\nwith me one night longer?”\n\n“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon be\nhere.  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the\ncrocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  My companions are\nbuilding a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves\nare watching them, and cooing to each other.  Dear Prince, I must leave\nyou, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back\ntwo beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.  The ruby\nshall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the\ngreat sea.”\n\n“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little\nmatch-girl.  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all\nspoiled.  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money,\nand she is crying.  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is\nbare.  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will\nnot beat her.”\n\n“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, “but I cannot\npluck out your eye.  You would be quite blind then.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\nyou.”\n\nSo he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down with it.  He\nswooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her\nhand.  “What a lovely bit of glass,” cried the little girl; and she ran\nhome, laughing.\n\nThen the Swallow came back to the Prince.  “You are blind now,” he said,\n“so I will stay with you always.”\n\n“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away to Egypt.”\n\n“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the\nPrince’s feet.\n\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him stories of\nwhat he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who\nstand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their\nbeaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the\ndesert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the\nside of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King\nof the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a\nlarge crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and\nhas twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who\nsail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the\nbutterflies.\n\n“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous\nthings, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of\nwomen.  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.  Fly over my city, little\nSwallow, and tell me what you see there.”\n\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in\ntheir beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He\nflew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children\nlooking out listlessly at the black streets.  Under the archway of a\nbridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep\nthemselves warm.  “How hungry we are!” they said.  “You must not lie\nhere,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\n\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\n\n“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it off,\nleaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold\ncan make them happy.”\n\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy\nPrince looked quite dull and grey.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he\nbrought to the poor, and the children’s faces grew rosier, and they\nlaughed and played games in the street.  “We have bread now!” they cried.\n\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  The streets\nlooked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and\nglistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of\nthe houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore\nscarlet caps and skated on the ice.\n\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave\nthe Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the\nbaker’s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself\nwarm by flapping his wings.\n\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die.  He had just strength to\nfly up to the Prince’s shoulder once more.  “Good-bye, dear Prince!” he\nmurmured, “will you let me kiss your hand?”\n\n“I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,” said the\nPrince, “you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips,\nfor I love you.”\n\n“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the Swallow.  “I am going to\nthe House of Death.  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?”\n\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his\nfeet.\n\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something\nhad broken.  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.\nIt certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\n\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in\ncompany with the Town Councillors.  As they passed the column he looked\nup at the statue: “Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!” he said.\n\n“How shabby indeed!” cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with\nthe Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\n\n“The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is\ngolden no longer,” said the Mayor in fact, “he is litttle better than a\nbeggar!”\n\n“Little better than a beggar,” said the Town Councillors.\n\n“And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!” continued the Mayor.  “We\nmust really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die\nhere.”  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.\n\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.  “As he is no longer\nbeautiful he is no longer useful,” said the Art Professor at the\nUniversity.\n\nThen they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of\nthe Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.  “We must\nhave another statue, of course,” he said, “and it shall be a statue of\nmyself.”\n\n“Of myself,” said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.\nWhen I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.\n\n“What a strange thing!” said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.\n“This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.  We must throw it\naway.”  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also\nlying.\n\n“Bring me the two most precious things in the city,” said God to one of\nHis Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.\n\n“You have rightly chosen,” said God, “for in my garden of Paradise this\nlittle bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy\nPrince shall praise me.”\n\n","ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.  He had\nbright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long\nbit of black india-rubber.  The little ducks were swimming about in the\npond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who\nwas pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand\non their heads in the water.\n\n“You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your\nheads,” she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them\nhow it was done.  But the little ducks paid no attention to her.  They\nwere so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in\nsociety at all.\n\n“What disobedient children!” cried the old Water-rat; “they really\ndeserve to be drowned.”\n\n“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, “every one must make a\nbeginning, and parents cannot be too patient.”\n\n“Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,” said the Water-rat;\n“I am not a family man.  In fact, I have never been married, and I never\nintend to be.  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much\nhigher.  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or\nrarer than a devoted friendship.”\n\n“And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?” asked a\nGreen Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard\nthe conversation.\n\n“Yes, that is just what I want to know,” said the Duck; and she swam away\nto the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her\nchildren a good example.\n\n“What a silly question!” cried the Water-rat.  “I should expect my\ndevoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.”\n\n“And what would you do in return?” said the little bird, swinging upon a\nsilver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.\n\n“I don’t understand you,” answered the Water-rat.\n\n“Let me tell you a story on the subject,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Is the story about me?” asked the Water-rat.  “If so, I will listen to\nit, for I am extremely fond of fiction.”\n\n“It is applicable to you,” answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and\nalighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.\n\n“Once upon a time,” said the Linnet, “there was an honest little fellow\nnamed Hans.”\n\n“Was he very distinguished?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“No,” answered the Linnet, “I don’t think he was distinguished at all,\nexcept for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.  He\nlived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his\ngarden.  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.\nSweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds’-purses, and\nFair-maids of France.  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac\nCrocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white.  Columbine and Ladysmock,\nMarjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil\nand the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the\nmonths went by, one flower taking another flower’s place, so that there\nwere always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.\n\n“Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all\nwas big Hugh the Miller.  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to\nlittle Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over\nthe wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or\nfilling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.\n\n“‘Real friends should have everything in common,’ the Miller used to say,\nand little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend\nwith such noble ideas.\n\n“Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich\nMiller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred\nsacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large\nflock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these\nthings, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the\nwonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true\nfriendship.\n\n“So little Hans worked away in his garden.  During the spring, the\nsummer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and\nhe had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good\ndeal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper\nbut a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  In the winter, also, he was\nextremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.\n\n“‘There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow\nlasts,’ the Miller used to say to his wife, ‘for when people are in\ntrouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.  That\nat least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.  So I\nshall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and\nhe will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make\nhim so happy.’\n\n“‘You are certainly very thoughtful about others,’ answered the Wife, as\nshe sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; ‘very\nthoughtful indeed.  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about\nfriendship.  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful\nthings as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear\na gold ring on his little finger.’\n\n“‘But could we not ask little Hans up here?’ said the Miller’s youngest\nson.  ‘If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and\nshow him my white rabbits.’\n\n“‘What a silly boy you are!’ cried the Miller; ‘I really don’t know what\nis the use of sending you to school.  You seem not to learn anything.\nWhy, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good\nsupper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is\na most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody’s nature.  I certainly\nwill not allow Hans’ nature to be spoiled.  I am his best friend, and I\nwill always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any\ntemptations.  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have\nsome flour on credit, and that I could not do.  Flour is one thing, and\nfriendship is another, and they should not be confused.  Why, the words\nare spelt differently, and mean quite different things.  Everybody can\nsee that.’\n\n“‘How well you talk!’ said the Miller’s Wife, pouring herself out a large\nglass of warm ale; ‘really I feel quite drowsy.  It is just like being in\nchurch.’\n\n“‘Lots of people act well,’ answered the Miller; ‘but very few people\ntalk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of\nthe two, and much the finer thing also’; and he looked sternly across the\ntable at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his\nhead down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.\nHowever, he was so young that you must excuse him.”\n\n“Is that the end of the story?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Certainly not,” answered the Linnet, “that is the beginning.”\n\n“Then you are quite behind the age,” said the Water-rat.  “Every good\nstory-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the\nbeginning, and concludes with the middle.  That is the new method.  I\nheard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the\npond with a young man.  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am\nsure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head,\nand whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered ‘Pooh!’\nBut pray go on with your story.  I like the Miller immensely.  I have all\nkinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy\nbetween us.”\n\n“Well,” said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, “as\nsoon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale\nyellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see\nlittle Hans.\n\n“‘Why, what a good heart you have!’ cried his Wife; ‘you are always\nthinking of others.  And mind you take the big basket with you for the\nflowers.’\n\n“So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron\nchain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.\n\n“‘Good morning, little Hans,’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Good morning,’ said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to\near.\n\n“‘And how have you been all the winter?’ said the Miller.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ cried Hans, ‘it is very good of you to ask, very good\nindeed.  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring\nhas come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.’\n\n“‘We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘and\nwondered how you were getting on.’\n\n“‘That was kind of you,’ said Hans; ‘I was half afraid you had forgotten\nme.’\n\n“‘Hans, I am surprised at you,’ said the Miller; ‘friendship never\nforgets.  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don’t\nunderstand the poetry of life.  How lovely your primroses are looking,\nby-the-bye!”\n\n“‘They are certainly very lovely,’ said Hans, ‘and it is a most lucky\nthing for me that I have so many.  I am going to bring them into the\nmarket and sell them to the Burgomaster’s daughter, and buy back my\nwheelbarrow with the money.’\n\n“‘Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don’t mean to say you have sold it?\nWhat a very stupid thing to do!’\n\n“‘Well, the fact is,’ said Hans, ‘that I was obliged to.  You see the\nwinter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to\nbuy bread with.  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat,\nand then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last\nI sold my wheelbarrow.  But I am going to buy them all back again now.’\n\n“‘Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘I will give you my wheelbarrow.  It is not in\nvery good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong\nwith the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.  I\nknow it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me\nextremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the\nworld.  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and,\nbesides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.  Yes, you may set your\nmind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.’\n\n“‘Well, really, that is generous of you,’ said little Hans, and his funny\nround face glowed all over with pleasure.  ‘I can easily put it in\nrepair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.’\n\n“‘A plank of wood!’ said the Miller; ‘why, that is just what I want for\nthe roof of my barn.  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will\nall get damp if I don’t stop it up.  How lucky you mentioned it!  It is\nquite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.  I have given\nyou my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.  Of\ncourse, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true,\nfriendship never notices things like that.  Pray get it at once, and I\nwill set to work at my barn this very day.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the\nplank out.\n\n“‘It is not a very big plank,’ said the Miller, looking at it, ‘and I am\nafraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won’t be any left for\nyou to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault.\nAnd now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to\ngive me some flowers in return.  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it\nquite full.’\n\n“‘Quite full?’ said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a\nvery big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no\nflowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver\nbuttons back.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘as I have given you my\nwheelbarrow, I don’t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.\nI may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true\nfriendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.’\n\n“‘My dear friend, my best friend,’ cried little Hans, ‘you are welcome to\nall the flowers in my garden.  I would much sooner have your good opinion\nthan my silver buttons, any day’; and he ran and plucked all his pretty\nprimroses, and filled the Miller’s basket.\n\n“‘Good-bye, little Hans,’ said the Miller, as he went up the hill with\nthe plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.\n\n“‘Good-bye,’ said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he\nwas so pleased about the wheelbarrow.\n\n“The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when\nhe heard the Miller’s voice calling to him from the road.  So he jumped\noff the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.\n\n“There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘would you mind carrying this sack\nof flour for me to market?’\n\n“‘Oh, I am so sorry,’ said Hans, ‘but I am really very busy to-day.  I\nhave got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all\nmy grass to roll.’\n\n“‘Well, really,’ said the Miller, ‘I think that, considering that I am\ngoing to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to\nrefuse.’\n\n“‘Oh, don’t say that,’ cried little Hans, ‘I wouldn’t be unfriendly for\nthe whole world’; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big\nsack on his shoulders.\n\n“It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans\nhad reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down\nand rest.  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the\nmarket.  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour\nfor a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was\nafraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.\n\n“‘It has certainly been a hard day,’ said little Hans to himself as he\nwas going to bed, ‘but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is\nmy best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.’\n\n“Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his\nsack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.\n\n“‘Upon my word,’ said the Miller, ‘you are very lazy.  Really,\nconsidering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might\nwork harder.  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don’t like any of\nmy friends to be idle or sluggish.  You must not mind my speaking quite\nplainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not\nyour friend.  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say\nexactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to\nplease and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things,\nand does not mind giving pain.  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he\nprefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off\nhis night-cap, ‘but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for\na little time, and listen to the birds singing.  Do you know that I\nalways work better after hearing the birds sing?’\n\n“‘Well, I am glad of that,’ said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the\nback, ‘for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed,\nand mend my barn-roof for me.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his\nflowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse\nthe Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.\n\n“‘Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?’ he\ninquired in a shy and timid voice.\n\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘I do not think it is much to ask\nof you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of\ncourse if you refuse I will go and do it myself.’\n\n“‘Oh! on no account,’ cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and\ndressed himself, and went up to the barn.\n\n“He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came\nto see how he was getting on.\n\n“‘Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?’ cried the\nMiller in a cheery voice.\n\n“‘It is quite mended,’ answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.\n\n“‘Ah!’ said the Miller, ‘there is no work so delightful as the work one\ndoes for others.’\n\n“‘It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,’ answered little\nHans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, ‘a very great privilege.\nBut I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.’\n\n“‘Oh! they will come to you,’ said the Miller, ‘but you must take more\npains.  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you\nwill have the theory also.’\n\n“‘Do you really think I shall?’ asked little Hans.\n\n“‘I have no doubt of it,’ answered the Miller, ‘but now that you have\nmended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive\nmy sheep to the mountain to-morrow.’\n\n“Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next\nmorning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans\nstarted off with them to the mountain.  It took him the whole day to get\nthere and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to\nsleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.\n\n“‘What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,’ he said, and he went\nto work at once.\n\n“But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his\nfriend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long\nerrands, or getting him to help at the mill.  Little Hans was very much\ndistressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had\nforgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller\nwas his best friend.  ‘Besides,’ he used to say, ‘he is going to give me\nhis wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.’\n\n“So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds\nof beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a\nnote-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good\nscholar.\n\n“Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside\nwhen a loud rap came at the door.  It was a very wild night, and the wind\nwas blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he\nthought it was merely the storm.  But a second rap came, and then a\nthird, louder than any of the others.\n\n“‘It is some poor traveller,’ said little Hans to himself, and he ran to\nthe door.\n\n“There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the\nother.\n\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ cried the Miller, ‘I am in great trouble.  My little\nboy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the\nDoctor.  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it\nhas just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead\nof me.  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is\nonly fair that you should do something for me in return.’\n\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, ‘I take it quite as a compliment your\ncoming to me, and I will start off at once.  But you must lend me your\nlantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the\nditch.’\n\n“‘I am very sorry,’ answered the Miller, ‘but it is my new lantern, and\nit would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.’\n\n“‘Well, never mind, I will do without it,’ cried little Hans, and he took\ndown his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler\nround his throat, and started off.\n\n“What a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans\ncould hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely\nstand.  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking\nabout three hours, he arrived at the Doctor’s house, and knocked at the\ndoor.\n\n“‘Who is there?’ cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom\nwindow.\n\n“‘Little Hans, Doctor.’\n\n“’What do you want, little Hans?’\n\n“‘The Miller’s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and\nthe Miller wants you to come at once.’\n\n“‘All right!’ said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big\nboots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the\ndirection of the Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him.\n\n“But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and\nlittle Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.\nAt last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very\ndangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans\nwas drowned.  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating\nin a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.\n\n“Everybody went to little Hans’ funeral, as he was so popular, and the\nMiller was the chief mourner.\n\n“‘As I was his best friend,’ said the Miller, ‘it is only fair that I\nshould have the best place’; so he walked at the head of the procession\nin a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a\nbig pocket-handkerchief.\n\n“‘Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,’ said the\nBlacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated\ncomfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.\n\n“‘A great loss to me at any rate,’ answered the Miller; ‘why, I had as\ngood as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don’t know what to do\nwith it.  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair\nthat I could not get anything for it if I sold it.  I will certainly take\ncare not to give away anything again.  One always suffers for being\ngenerous.’”\n\n“Well?” said the Water-rat, after a long pause.\n\n“Well, that is the end,” said the Linnet.\n\n“But what became of the Miller?” asked the Water-rat.\n\n“Oh!  I really don’t know,” replied the Linnet; “and I am sure that I\ndon’t care.”\n\n“It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,” said\nthe Water-rat.\n\n“I am afraid you don’t quite see the moral of the story,” remarked the\nLinnet.\n\n“The what?” screamed the Water-rat.\n\n“The moral.”\n\n“Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?”\n\n“Certainly,” said the Linnet.\n\n“Well, really,” said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, “I think you\nshould have told me that before you began.  If you had done so, I\ncertainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said\n‘Pooh,’ like the critic.  However, I can say it now”; so he shouted out\n“Pooh” at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back\ninto his hole.\n\n“And how do you like the Water-rat?” asked the Duck, who came paddling up\nsome minutes afterwards.  “He has a great many good points, but for my\nown part I have a mother’s feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed\nbachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.”\n\n“I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,” answered the Linnet.  “The\nfact is, that I told him a story with a moral.”\n\n“Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,” said the Duck.\n\nAnd I quite agree with her.\n\n","Hey...\nHey!\nHi!\nPheebs, what's wrong?\nOh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...  HUGE engagement ring!\nOH!\nMy God!\nHey!   Congratulations! Wow!!\nSo, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared,  or Yeah, big surprise,  I like proposals!\nWell, it was really sweet, and like the  most romantic thing ever.\nWell, hey! Well... To Phoebe and Mike!\nWhoo!\nThank you! Oh, and I have something for  you!\nMmh-mmh!\nIt's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers  of all the guys I've dated.\nOh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what,  I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?\nI would, but you're the last one.\nPablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, \"Guy-in-van\"?\nOh, my first love!\nOh!\nWhat does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?\nDead. Oh, it's OK, no,  he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave  at Omaha Beach.\nHey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my  black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin.  With Janice's phone number on it.\nPhoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?\nOh yes, they are.\nHey honey!\nHi sweetie!\nIs Monica not here?\nNo.\nOh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for  a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!\nCool!\nYeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas  were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were  mine!!!\nThat's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?\nOh... I don't know, I really don't think you're  right for the part.\nWhat do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon!  Huh? I'm cold!! Huh??  Come on! What can't I do?\nFirst of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think  you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.\nI can do that! \"Hello, I'm  your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing.  I like to use...\" Oh, what's the product?\nSoftware that facilitates inter-business networking  e-solutions?\nI'm cold!\nHey!\nHey!\nGuess who's a finalist for a huge research  grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.\nAh, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand  up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!\nOh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds  of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not  that I'm keeping score or anything... five!\nWow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!\nWell, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get  it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there  will be an article about me in the \"Paleontology Review\"! Yeah!  That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious  questions  about my work!\nWait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?\nYeah. Why?\nBenjamin Hobart is administering that grant.\nYour ex-boyfriend?\nYeah.\nSo, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new  boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!\nNo, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything,  I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner  together, and I can introduce you.\nWell, if you think it would help.\nYes, absolutely. I'll call him.\nOk, now, is there anything I can do to... you know,  butter him up? Anything he really likes?\nMmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.\nWe'll see how dinner goes.\nHey!\nHey, you wanna go to see a movie?\nWell, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing  out stuff, so Mike could move in.\nOh, right.\nYeah.\nOh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you  with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!\nOh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did  you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?\nUh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?   A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me  to get rid of Gladys.\nWho's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!\nYeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh,  I know!! Oh, you should take her!\nWell, I-I-I-I... I don't know...\nWhy, you don't like her?\nWell, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll  take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too  easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!\nReally? You think?\nAbsolutely! Yes, you say to him \"I'm sorry  Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!\"\nOk, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just  realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.\nDamn it, I did not think this through!\n \nHey you guys.\nHi!\nOh! Any word on casting yet?\nJoe, I told you, you're just not right for  the part.\nWhat do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor  you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?\nI'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna  be interested in.\nJoey . Look, here's a  copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.\nJoe...\nJust watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't  pass it on to your bosses!\nFine!\nThank you.\nWork, Joe!\nDamn it!\nWhat am I gonna do now?\nJust pass it to your boss!\nHe's not right for the part. So if I suggest  him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should  learn on their own!\nJust tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked  it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and  they're the bad guys.\nThat's good! I liked it, they didn't.  .\nRoss: I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart.  I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner  party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley  or C3PO?\nSorry, looks  like it's just him.\nCharlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!\nWell, I... I am having a good hair day.\nSo good to see you.\nMe too.\nI'm ok.\nI'm sorry... Ross  Geller... Benjamin Hobart.\nIt's an honor to meet you. I can't tell  you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,  whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of  the reasons I got into the field.\nOh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've  never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!\nShall we? .\n. I can't  believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?\nOh my God, I completely forgot! .\nBenjamin : You weren't there!\nNo, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image,  you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz,  mmm.\nRoss, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal,  while I go to the ladies room?\nSo, tell me about it.\nOk well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.\nM-m.\nSee, there are still several areas that haven't  been fully excavated.\nBreak up with Charlie!\nWhat?\nWhat?\nDid you just say \"break up with Charlie\"?\nWell, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I  didn't not say it.\nKind of inappropriate, don't you think?\nI'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so  long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much  I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.\nAre you serious?\nIf you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then  I'm joking!\nNo!\nJoking it is!\nHi! Sorry, I'm late.\nHey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you  keep the painting?\nNo, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me  keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news  is, Gladys is yours!\nWow, what's the bad news!\nWho's Gladys?\nOh, she's that work of art I made, you know,  with the woman coming out of the frame.\nOh, and Monica gets to keep her?  In her house? I am so jealous!\nOh, I didn't know you wanted her too!\nHuh!\nWell, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already  gave that to Monica, so...\nYou know, I would give her up, for you.\nNo, I couldn't let you do that.\nBut I want to.\nBut I don't want you to.\nBut I insist!\nBut I insist harder!\nGirls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads,  she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!\nNo, that landed in your food!\nNo, no, that's ok. You won fair  and square. I'm so sad!\nHey Joe!\nWhat's up?\nBad news. I watched the tape and passed it along  to my bosses and they weren't interested.\nOh.\nI'm sorry man.\nBut, ehm... you watched  the tape?\nBut, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it.  Stupid sons of bitches!\nYou didn't watch the tape.\nWhat!? Of course I did!\nLook, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?\nI'm not lying to you, I watched it!\nWell, you lied again!\nI watched it!\nKeep going Pinocchio!\nI did!\nDid you watch the tape?\nNo!\nThe selection committee has chosen the three of  you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers  you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you  claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you  propose to correct this problem?\nWell, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological  evidence. I plan to begin there.\nInteresting.\nI guess!\nDr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work.  Where might that take place?\nPrimarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.\nCertainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my  birthday?Care to venture a guess?\nMay 12th?\nDr. Li, how many graduate students  you'd be needing?\nHalf a dozen.\nI see, and Dr. Biely?\nThree for excavation and two for analysis.\nCertainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit  was later covered by a popular British invasion band?\nWha..? I need 6 graduate students.\nNo! I'm sorry, we were looking for \"Baby It's  You\". Baby It's You.\nWha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my  questions have anything to do with Paleontology.\nYou're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question.  Spell \"Boscodictiasaur\".\num... I've never heard of a \"Boscodictiasaur\".\nYeah, I just made it up. Spell it.\nB - O - S ...\nNo, it starts with a silent \"M\".\nOh come on!!\nI can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!\nBut you are a liar.\nWhat did I just say?\nYou still here?\nYes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am  insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...\nOk whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok?  First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about  lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying  about... lying... Stop lying!\nWhy are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?\nWell, this is going well.\n.\nHe really is a chameleon.\nOh, my!Monica: I haven't really settled on a spot yet!\nWell, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be  the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!\nYeah, yeah! And you can  get rid of that French poster.\nI like that poster!\nReally? It doesn't have anything coming out of it.  Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?\nOh! There's  nothing above your bed!!\nAre you still here?\nRoss: Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology  related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps?  Aunt Margaret's pants size?\nI've come here to apologize. I think I may have  let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.\nNo! Stop!\nAnyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.\nReally?\nWell... there is just one small... stipulation...\nI have to break up with Charlie?\nHey, you got one right!\nYou're crazy.\nCrazy, or... romantic?\nCrazy!\nOoor...O-oh my God!\nWhat?\nJoey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?\nI got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very  reasonable price.\nJoey, we're not keeping this!\nBut it's an original Buffay...\nAlright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't  mind that she's haunted.\nHey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?\nWell, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive  when you're asleep.\nShe climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body  across the floor, just looking for legs to steal.  And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your  doorknob.\nGET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!\nHey! I sold that to Joey.\nWell, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at  this game.\nNo, too late. You can't give it back!\nYes I can!\nNo you can't. She's yours!\nShe's yours!\nSHE'S YOURS!\nShe's yours!\nHey!\nShe's mine!\nShe's m-i-i-ne!\nShe's mine!\nShe's mine!\nYou guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her  anymore.\nI want Gladys!\nShe's mine!\nShe's mine!\nShe's mine!\nShe's mine!\nLook, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And  I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part  or not.\nThat's not the point Chandler. The point is that you  lied.\nI know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you  to forgive me?\nOh my God!\nExcellent!\nNow, what do you say?\nLying is wrong!\nAnd?... AND?\nI'm a pretty little girl.\nI knew it!\nYour ex-boyfriend is insane.\nDid you get the grant?\nNo I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your  ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.\nWhat?\nYeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't  give you up.\nBenji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up  with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.\nReally? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review,  who was the voice of \"Underdog\"?\nI'm sure he was just joking, Ross.\nIf you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay?  I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.\nSeriously?\nOh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do  you spell Mboscodictiosaur?\nWell, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then  M-B-O...\nDamnit!\nDr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are  you doing here?\nI want you to tell her everything. About the deal you  tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the  voice of Underdog!\nLike I tried to tell you in the interview Ross,  this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.\nNo, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in  the eyes, and tell her the truth.\nBenji?\nAlright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's  only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in  my life.\nToo little, too late, Benji!\nI can't believe this.\nI never should have broken up with you. I think  about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?\nNo!\nYes!\nWhat?\nI don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so....  romantic.\nor...\nListen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here,  but is there any chance you will take me back?\nMaybe...\nSweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a  little uncomfortable.\nOh God! I am so sorry, but... I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...\nI'm sorry  too...\nI love you!\nI love you too!\nOkay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!\nGladys?\nHa ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not  get old.\nYou're mean!\nOh, don't be such a baby!\n \n","Article 901: Scope and Coverage\n1. This Chapter applies to standards-related measures of a Party, other than those covered by Section B of Chapter Seven (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade in goods or services between the Parties, and to measures of the Parties relating to such measures.\n2. Technical specifications prepared by governmental bodies for production or consumption requirements of such bodies shall be governed exclusively by Chapter Ten (Government Procurement).\nArticle 902: Extent of Obligations\n1. Article 105 (Extent of Obligations) does not apply to this Chapter.\n2. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure observance of Articles 904 through 908 by state or provincial governments and by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory.\nArticle 903: Affirmation of Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and Other Agreements\nFurther to Article 103 (Relation to Other Agreements), the Parties affirm with respect to each other their existing rights and obligations relating to standards-related measures under the GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and all other international agreements, including environmental and conservation agreements, to which those Parties are party.\nArticle 904: Basic Rights and Obligations\nRight to Take Standards-Related Measures\n1. Each Party may, in accordance with this Agreement, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure, including any such measure relating to safety, the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, and any measure to ensure its enforcement or implementation. Such measures include those to prohibit the importation of a good of another Party or the provision of a service by a service provider of another Party that fails to comply with the applicable requirements of those measures or to complete the Party's approval procedures.\nRight to Establish Level of Protection\n2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, each Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives of safety or the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, establish the levels of protection that it considers appropriate in accordance with Article 907(2).\nNon-Discriminatory Treatment\n3. Each Party shall, in respect of its standards-related measures, accord to goods and service providers of another Party:\n\n(a) national treatment in accordance with Article 301 (Market Access) or Article 1202 (Cross-Border Trade in Services); and\n(b) treatment no less favorable than that it accords to like goods, or in like circumstances to service providers, of any other country.\nUnnecessary Obstacles\n4. No Party may prepare, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure with a view to or with the effect of creating an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties. An unnecessary obstacle to trade shall not be deemed to be created where:\n\n(a) the demonstrable purpose of the measure is to achieve a legitimate objective; and\n(b) the measure does not operate to exclude goods of another Party that meet that legitimate objective.\nArticle 905: Use of International Standards\n1. Each Party shall use, as a basis for its standards-related measures, relevant international standards or international standards whose completion is imminent, except where such standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means to fulfill its legitimate objectives, for example because of fundamental climatic, geographical, technological or infrastructural factors, scientific justification or the level of protection that the Party considers appropriate.\n2. A Party's standards-related measure that conforms to an international standard shall be presumed to be consistent with Article 904(3) and (4).\n3. Nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, from adopting, maintaining or applying any standards-related measure that results in a higher level of protection than would be achieved if the measure were based on the relevant international standard.\nArticle 906: Compatibility and Equivalence\n1. Recognizing the crucial role of standards-related measures in achieving legitimate objectives, the Parties shall, in accordance with this Chapter, work jointly to enhance the level of safety and of protection of human, animal and plant life and health, the environment and consumers.\n2. Without reducing the level of safety or of protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, without prejudice to the rights of any Party under this Chapter, and taking into account international standardization activities, the Parties shall, to the greatest extent practicable, make compatible their respective standards-related measures, so as to facilitate trade in a good or service between the Parties.\n3. Further to Articles 902 and 905, a Party shall, on request of another Party, seek, through appropriate measures, to promote the compatibility of a specific standard or conformity assessment procedure that is maintained in its territory with the standards or conformity assessment procedures maintained in the territory of the other Party.\n4. Each importing Party shall treat a technical regulation adopted or maintained by an exporting Party as equivalent to its own where the exporting Party, in cooperation with the importing Party, demonstrates to the satisfaction of the importing Party that its technical regulation adequately fulfills the importing Party's legitimate objectives.\n5. The importing Party shall provide to the exporting Party, on request, its reasons in writing for not treating a technical regulation as equivalent under paragraph 4.\n6. Each Party shall, wherever possible, accept the results of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in the territory of another Party, provided that it is satisfied that the procedure offers an assurance, equivalent to that provided by a procedure it conducts or a procedure conducted in its territory the results of which it accepts, that the relevant good or service complies with the applicable technical regulation or standard adopted or maintained in the Party's territory.\n7. Prior to accepting the results of a conformity assessment procedure pursuant to paragraph 6, and to enhance confidence in the continued reliability of each other's conformity assessment results, the Parties may consult on such matters as the technical competence of the conformity assessment bodies involved, including verified compliance with relevant international standards through such means as accreditation.\nArticle 907: Assessment of Risk\n1. A Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, conduct an assessment of risk. In conducting an assessment, a Party may take into account, among other factors relating to a good or service:\n\n(a) available scientific evidence or technical information;\n(b) intended end uses;\n(c) processes or production, operating, inspection, sampling or testing methods; or\n(d) environmental conditions.\n2. Where pursuant to Article 904(2) a Party establishes a level of protection that it considers appropriate and conducts an assessment of risk, it should avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions between similar goods or services in the level of protection it considers appropriate, where the distinctions:\n\n(a) result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against goods or service providers of another Party;\n(b) constitute a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties; or\n(c) discriminate between similar goods or services for the same use under the same conditions that pose the same level of risk and provide similar benefits.\n3. Where a Party conducting an assessment of risk determines that available scientific evidence or other information is insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a provisional technical regulation on the basis of available relevant information. The Party shall, within a reasonable period after information sufficient to complete the assessment of risk is presented to it, complete its assessment, review and, where appropriate, revise the provisional technical regulation in the light of that assessment.\nArticle 908: Conformity Assessment\n1. The Parties shall, further to Article 906 and recognizing the existence of substantial differences in the structure, organization and operation of conformity assessment procedures in their respective territories, make compatible those procedures to the greatest extent practicable.\n2. Recognizing that it should be to the mutual advantage of the Parties concerned and except as set out in Annex 908.2, each Party shall accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize conformity assessment bodies in the territory of another Party on terms no less favorable than those accorded to conformity assessment bodies in its territory.\n3. Each Party shall, with respect to its conformity assessment procedures:\n\n(a) not adopt or maintain any such procedure that is stricter, nor apply the procedure more strictly, than necessary to give it confidence that a good or a service conforms with an applicable technical regulation or standard, taking into account the risks that non-conformity would create;\n(b) initiate and complete the procedure as expeditiously as possible;\n(c) in accordance with Article 904(3), undertake processing of applications in non-discriminatory order;\n(d) publish the normal processing period for each such procedure or communicate the anticipated processing period to an applicant on request;\n(e) ensure that the competent body\n\n(i) on receipt of an application, promptly examines the completeness of the documentation and informs the applicant in a precise and complete manner of any deficiency,\n(ii) transmits to the applicant as soon as possible the results of the conformity assessment procedure in a form that is precise and complete so that the applicant may take any necessary corrective action,\n(iii) where the application is deficient, proceeds as far as practicable with the procedure where the applicant so requests, and\n(iv) informs the applicant, on request, of the status of the application and the reasons for any delay;\n(f) limit the information the applicant is required to supply to that necessary to conduct the procedure and to determine appropriate fees;\n(g) accord confidential or proprietary information arising from, or supplied in connection with, the conduct of the procedure for a good of another Party or for a service provided by a person of another Party\n\n(i) the same treatment as that for a good of the Party or a service provided by a person of the Party, and\n(ii) in any event, treatment that protects an applicant's legitimate commercial interests to the extent provided under the Party's law;\n(h) ensure that any fee it imposes for conducting the procedure is no higher for a good of another Party or a service provider of another Party than is equitable in relation to any such fee imposed for its like goods or service providers or for like goods or service providers of any other country, taking into account communication, transportation and other related costs;\n(i) ensure that the location of facilities at which a conformity assessment procedure is conducted does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent;\n(j) limit the procedure, for a good or service modified subsequent to a determination that the good or service conforms to the applicable technical regulation or standard, to that necessary to determine that the good or service continues to conform to the technical regulation or standard; and\n(k) limit any requirement regarding samples of a good to that which is reasonable, and ensure that the selection of samples does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent.\n4.

I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.\nDo you know anything about women?\nNo.\nThat's all right.\nOkay.\n","\nApart from the occasional caffeine (which has little effect on me) and a few half-glasses of champagne at various special events, and some demerol in hospitals on two occasions, I had no experience with psychoactives prior to trying LSD. Stimulants and depressants are simply not appealing to me and opiates are far too risky. As long as I have known about them (probably since one of those 'Just Say No' lectures that public schools were constantly having in the 80s) LSD (and by extension all psychedelics) have been intriguing to me. I vaguely remember at some point in 8th or 9th grade thinking 'if only LSD did not cause brain damage it would be the perfect drug, and even I would try it'.\n\nRoll the clock forward about 10 years. I have recently started reading Hunter Thompson and listening to an increasing amount of psychedelic music (both 1st generation stuff and newer things like the Butthole Surfers and the Cramps). Naturally, I sought out information on these fascinating substances which had inspired so much great music and literature. Before long, I had learned that, while certainly not 'safe' (what is?), the risks of LSD were almost entirely of the psychological nature. The point is, between the time at which I decided I was going to try LSD and the time I actually tried it I spent about 7 months researching and generally preparing myself mentally for it. This definitely payed off... when I later described some of the most impressive moments of the trip to my friend who acted as guide (and who has had a lot of experience, having taken acid a few hundred times), she was suprised that I had enjoyed it at all. I loved it, paranoia, loss of self, loss of linear time and all. I was not anxious to try it again immediately, but I will almost certainly use it again in the future; I could easily see myself using it once or twice a year indefinitely.\n\nThe experience itself:\n\nI arrived the day before and slept on the couch. the next morning I awoke around 10 and took a long shower, followed by a light breakfast (I cannot remember precisely what). We sat and talked for a little while with her boyfriend, then got the acid from te refrigerator and divided it up. It was difficult to tell how much I took because we only had leftover edges from a sheet, but in retrospect it is clear that she had a prett good idea of how much was actually there. At any rate, I had about four pieces; she had two. After eating it (I swallowed the paper after a minute or so, which her boyriend then warned me not to do - it made his stomach upset...) her boyfriend left for work and we sat and talked aout nothing in particular, looked at some Maurice Sendak books, and waited. And waited. After about 20 minutes I was just beginning to feel it. Nothing was actually different, but there was an increasing sense of anticipation: SOMETHING was about to happen. We moved to the living room and put on some music. Some buddhist chants she had downloaded a few weeks before... nice background music, though somewhat humorous on a meta level: here we are, full of acid listening to buddhist chants in her living room. I found the idea of that strangely amusing. Something was happening, all right.\n\nI guess it took about an hour before it really kicked in, but I can't be sure. I tend to be kind of analytical, so she had hidden all of the clocks in the house beforehand and I had placed my watch safely out of reach. The wait was definitely on the long side, though. Then, without much warning, I could feel it starting to pick up: sort of waves of electricity traveling up my body. She was obviously farther along than I, and asked if I wanted more or not (we had previously discussed whether to go for a lot right off or do a bit at a time so I didn't get more than I felt comfortable with; it ended up being somewhere in between, as my initial dose was probably about the same as an average tab). I said 'sure' and she went to the kitchen to get it. I stood up and took a few steps toward the wall. All of a sudden, everything started to twist into a sort of counterclockwise nautilus spiral, which was centered somewhere above and to the left of my head. This was not visual (though there was initially a slight, brief distortion); it was only a nearly overpowering feeling. I looked at the prints and drawings that were hanging on the wall and thought something along the lines of 'I am HERE. This is it.' About this time, she returned with three more pieces which I put in my mouth and sucked on for maybe five minutes. I had not tasted anything from the first dose I took (which I attribute to the fact that I held it for about five minutes before taking it and my palms were slightly sweaty), but this one had a definite flavor. Despite her boyfriend's assertion that it tasted unpleasant, I enjoyed it. Interestingly enough, it tasted a bit like the acid (of a very different type) that dentists use to soften a tooth before filling it - a taste most people probably dislike.\n\nNow that we were fully taking off, I soon remembered that we had planned on drawing. We got out crayons and paper and made a 'book', which took somewhere between 15 minutes and an hour. When we were tired of drawing, we sat for a few minutes on the floor and did not do much of anything. Neither of us were having any significant visuals. Light seemed a little brighter and more 'pure' and sometimes moved on its own. Distances were distorted. There were no heavy colors or patterns, however, and nothing was significantly distorted. That is not to say that the trip was at all mild up to this point, however. It was simply not going on in the visual domain. Most of the changes were in perception, thought processes, and so forth. Very subjective, very hard to put into words. And, while I did not SEE any distortions or trails or the like, I certainly FELT them.\n\nWe were still sitting on the floor comparing notes when suddenly I snapped back to normalcy. It was almost instant and almost complete. Here I was sitting on the floor, perfectly sober. And there was the couch over there, a few feet away. I suddenly know that I had to get over there quickly while I still had the chance. I muttered something to that effect and stood up, stepped across the floor (only one step... but what a step it was) and dropped onto the couch.\n\n...ceiling, acoustic tiling. Tunneling upward.... the second dose must be kicking in...\n\n...\n\n'I... I think I might be a while... if you... want to read a book or something...'\n\n... picture on the wall is... alive... shapes crawling into themselves...\n\nI am siting on the couch. It is a bit darker outside than it was last time I noticed. Everything around me is still more or less solid, but it seems very distant. The computer is on, and some of the colors are leaking off of the screen onto the side of the monitor, but the picture itself is the only thing in the room that seems to be completely noral. Strange.\n\nI am looking across the room. I do not know how long I have been here. I can feel my body and the couch flowing into each other, a strangely comforting sensation. I am alone in the room, but I know that someone is in the other room, and will be back soon. Or is that me? Am I really just a reflection of what I am looking at? I can feel my presence start to leak out into the couch, like water from a plastic bottle with a leak in the bottom. The level of my existance is falling down my body; only my eyes and teeth are left. Just before everything else disappears completely into the couch, I remember reading 'The Psychedelic Experience' earlier that week, and recognize that this is, in its eccentric way, the 'pure whit elight' that Leary was talking about. Thinking this makes me quickly flow back up out of the couch into myself, much to my chagrin. I suppose that the act of thinking reminded me that I exist. I begin to flow out again, but it does not go much lower than my chest, and I end up laying back on the couch and just enjoying being around.\n\nHow long has it been since then? Minutes? Hours? Someone says something to me and a large stuffed bee attached to a keychain lands on my chest and looks at me. I look back. It is a friendly bee. I like it.\n\nIt is definitely nighttime now; the windows are dark. We have been playing Atari 2600 games on the computer for some time now. Or rather, I have been watching her play. I occasionally try to control the action a bit, but mostly I am content to watch. There is a game called 'Bobby is going home'. Bobby is jumping across puts and dodging viscious greek letters(!). The sky is purple, and the sun is flying around the sky in a figure 8 pattern. Bobby reaches the edge of the screen and moves to the next: the sun becomes a giant bird! I am now convinced that the atari 2600 was designed by and for acid users.\n\nI am walking to the kitchen to get a drink of water. The observing part of my brain realizes how absurd te entire situation is. It thinks of Peter Fonda: the perfect icon of the ridiculousness of LSD. For a brief moment I am standing behind myself watching: I AM Peter Fonda. I get my water, set it on a shelf, forget where it is, return, find it, drink it. We go to the bedroom to look at the ceiling, which is a sort of lumpy stucco. On the way, we notice a poster which depicts farm animals picketing. All of them are carrying signs except for the duck, who has a small red banner. We are sure that this is very important, but cannot decide why. I look at myself in the mirror and... there I am! And I can even move my mouth and eyes! I am happy to see this.\n\nWe have watched the ceiling for a while but we are both feeling restless. It has been quite a few hours now, and she is clearly overmost of it. I am still feeling strange, but I am definitely over the peak. We decide that, despite the cold and the icy streets, we are going to walk round outside a little bit.\n\nOut in the hallway. Bare white walls. No furniture except for a salvaged church pew with a life-sized cast of a tombstone sitting on it. We reach the front door and she tries to open it. Nothing. It is frozen. My mind races: the night before her boyfriend was late getting home from work and we had locked the keys in the apartment. We were stuck out in the rain for two hours. Now we want to get back out and we are locked IN! The perfect symmetry! I am overcome by the humor of the situation. am I laughing? I feel as though I am splitting apart from the waist up, becoming multiple images, like a photograph taken under strobe lights. But none of the motion is actually happening, is it? Is it?\n\nThe door finally opens - it was frozen shut - and we leave the house. I loo0k at the snow underneath the drainspout and admite the pefect fractal curve of crystals that are formed where water dripped onto it and froze. We walk down the street. The cold is severe, and I am starting to lose track of my body. Am I here? We walk down another street, but time is beginning to come apart. I am no longer experiencing my existance as a steady stream. It is a series of three basic images: looking forward, looking sideways, looking down at my feet. Each step I take the image changes in a cycle. This goes on forever, quite literally.\n\nWe are at a bus stop. A bus pulls up and the images speed up. I slide back into normal time and we decide not to get on the bus. I slide back to the ccling images, but there are more of them, closer together. We are in a richer neighborhood now. It is very dark, and all of the houses seem abandoned. We do not stay long. We are back on the main street, heading to the apartment. We pass a gas station. There is a large van filled with police. I feel unmoved: this is just the part where I act normal. We walk past and nobody pays the slightest bit of attention. I feel as if I am not actually connected to my body, but am in fact floating inside of it and trying to steer it around. She mentions something she read about that very sensation, though I had not mentioned it to her. 'I know exactly what you mean' I say loudly. The man walking his dog past us looks at me disapprovingly. 'But he doesn't,' I say, trying hard not to burst out laughing.\n\nWe are at an intersection. I cannot tell when and where the traffic is, but she is nearly back to normal and has no trouble negotiating the street crossing. As I step out into the road, however, I realize that I am no longer connected to my body at all: it is walking off across the road without me. Horror: what if I cannot catch up with it? The cars are coming! My body is almost across the street, but my consciousness is still standing right in the middle of it. I dash to the curb and, more or less, back into my body. I am not connected to it yet, but I have caught it and I fo not think it is going anywhere again. Sure enough, net time we cross a street, I only lag behind it slightly the first step or two. I am getting the hang of driving it around again.\n\nBack in the apartment. We are both getting tired, but there is no chance of sleeping yet. It is probably only 8 or 9 pm, anyway. We wander about, trying to decide what to do. It is cold. I am still shaken from beign outside. We want to watch a movie, but can't decide what. Finally we choose 'Heavenly Creatures', a personal favorite of each of us. Her copy is a pre-releasse bootleg in an unmarked tape. We heat up some vegan pizza-pocket type things (she is vegan; I hardly eat much meat, but thrive on cheese and find most vegan food of this kind a bit bland, so I am not overly aggressive about eating it) and start the tape. Soon we are both deeply absorbed in the movie. However, the way she relates to it is, naturally, quite different from the way I relate to it. Slowly but surely I begin to feel isolated. I begin to notice that whenever any of the characters on the screen are hostile, the picture becomes grainy and their faces begin to deform. Soon, not only are there distortions whenever characters are hostile or angry, but hissing sounds as well. And the angrier they get, the worse my food tastes. When they are happy, the food tastes better, the picture is clear, and there is no distortion or hissing. I begin to notice that the characters who are most grusomely deformed are men. And then it dawns on me: the distortions are not because of the LSD! No, what is really happening is that the tape was specially prepared in order to imprint me with some kind of anti-male, anti-heterosexual personality! That is why it the tape was not labeled. I begin to feel very uncomfortable. On the screen, people begin to grow horns and their faces twist into hideous grimaces. About halfway into the movie, there is a scene in which the main character loses her virginity to a particularly unpleasant, rattish man. As he is about to reach orgasm... the tape breaks! We stop the vcr and rewind it a bit to see if that will help, but there is no picture when we play. We rewind some more: still no picture. The tape is blank.\n\nWe have not gotten the tape to work, despite 15 minutes or so of sitting and looking at the VCR. I get up to go to the bathroom. Once in the bathroom, I look into the mirror. Throughout the trip, I have had menthol lip balm on, and it has made me unable to feel (and therefore, unable to remember the existance of ) the lower half of my face. Off an on, I have felt that my facial expressions are actually the facial expressions of people I am looking at, but happening on my face. This is an opportunity to test that. I look in the mirror. There I am, just like last time. I think to myself 'I am not sure exactly who I am, but I am sure that whoever I am I like it a lot.'\n\nA few hours have gone by. I am much closer to baseline now. Just tired, and my thought patterns are strange. Her boyfriend comes home and we sit and talk for a while. He reads our book. We keep him awake until about 2am, at which point we are all exhausted. They go to bed, and I turn off the lights and lie down on the couch. As I am about to close my eyes, I notice that the pattern on the couch is not just a pattern: it is a flaming, one eyed bird, and it is swooping down at me out of the cushion. I look at it for a moment, trying to decide whether or not we will be friends. I finally determine that we will get along, and close my eyes.\n\nMild closed-eye visuals as I fall asleep: moire patterns, kalidescope patterns, flying down chrome tunnels. At one point I am standing inside a strange house, looking out the window on the front door. Outside the window, there is a porch with a chair on it. On the chair sits a decaying corpse wearing a moth-eaten suit. I soon decide that I do not ilike this and go back to the tunnels and patterns.\n\nAbout an hour later, I wake up. There is a scratching sound: mice in the walls! And... my mostly uneaten vegan pizza is still sitting on a plate by the couch. If the mice decide the y want to eat it, they might crawl over me to get to it! I must move it away!\n\nEpilogue:\n\nThat is a basic account of what I can remember off the top of my head. It has been nearly three months, and I have been consistently much happier, much more able to focus, much more aware of the world around me, much more sure of who I am. I have always been pretty strong in all of these respects (though I am occasionally depressed for a week or two, as are most people I know), but since taking acid I feel as though they have all solidified. I know exactly who I am and where I am. While I might not be satisfied with everyhting in my life or th world, I am happy to be in it, as trite as that sounds. I waited until I was in an especially good state mentally before taking the acid, and I believe that it did a lot help imprint tthat state of mind into my personality much more deeply than it already was. For all the talk about LSD changing people's lives and personalities, I found that - much like hypnosis - it only created potential; the actual change was mad eby my own psyche. To draw upon the overused but very effective Huxley metaphor, LSD opens a door in your mind. But it does not make you walk through that door; that is up to you.\n\nWould I do LSD again? most definitely, if the opportunity to do it in a comfortable, safe manner presented itself. I would also be curious to try performing routine activities (shopping for food; visiting a busy mall; going to a movie) under low doses once or twice. At some point I am interested in trying DMT (which was the drug that I first began researching before deciding on LSD). Despite the fact that some of the later parts of that first trip were not what most people would consider pleasant, and were certainly not fun, I did not consider them 'negative' experiences at the time nor do I now. The only thing that I would really be unhappy about repeating would be crossing the street the first time.\n\nI would not outright recommend LSD to anyone. Moreso than most drugs, it is a very complex descision. I HAVE recommended that a couple of my friends who have not yet tried it but have some interest should spend some time reading about it and working at becoming comfortable with themselves before they even consider taking it. Sure, it is possible to just go out and do it without any trouble, but I cannot imagine that it would be nearly as satisfying, at east the first time. I think that it is incredibly important to have someone who you trust to guide you on your first trip. This has been said many times, but once more couldn't hurt.\n\nOne of the things that really helped me deal with some of the more uncomfortable moments was my firm belief that therre is no such thing as a 'bad' trip. A trip can be uncomfortable or downright frightening, but that is only 'bad' if the tripper interprets it that way. Some of the 'worst' experiences I've heard about from friends sound like some of the 'best' experiences I had (melting into the couch, for example - many other inexperienced people I have talked to were not at all comfortable when similar things happened to them). At least for me, remembering that 'good' and 'bad' are just human inventions that have no real bearing on the experience kept me from struggling against the uncomfortable moments, which is important.\n\nIf you go into it with the right mindset, I think acid can be one of the most positive and profound experiences a person can have, whether it is a 'good' trip or not. \n\n","Alright.

I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy.\nInstead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed,\nit occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a\nmouthful of supper and go immediately to bed.\n\nA light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit. More\nthan a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable. Still,\nthere can be no material objection to two. And really between two and\nthree, there is merely a single unit of difference. I ventured, perhaps,\nupon four. My wife will have it five;--but, clearly, she has confounded\ntwo very distinct affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to\nadmit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout,\nwithout which, in the way of condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.\n\nHaving thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the\nserene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon\nthe pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a\nprofound slumber forthwith.\n\nBut when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? I could not have\ncompleted my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the\nstreet-door bell, and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which\nawakened me at once. In a minute afterward, and while I was still\nrubbing my eyes, my wife thrust in my face a note, from my old friend,\nDoctor Ponnonner. It ran thus:\n\n      “Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you\n receive this. Come and help us to rejoice. At last, by long persevering\n diplomacy, I have gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum,\n to my examination of the Mummy--you know the one I mean. I have\n permission to unswathe it and open it, if desirable. A few friends only\n will be present--you, of course. The Mummy is now at my house, and we\n shall begin to unroll it at eleven to-night.\n\n           “Yours, ever,\n\n                   PONNONNER.\n\nBy the time I had reached the “Ponnonner,” it struck me that I was\nas wide awake as a man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy,\noverthrowing all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly\nmarvellous; and set off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor’s.\n\nThere I found a very eager company assembled. They had been awaiting me\nwith much impatience; the Mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and\nthe moment I entered its examination was commenced.\n\nIt was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain\nArthur Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner’s from a tomb near Eleithias, in\nthe Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile.\nThe grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban\nsepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more\nnumerous illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians. The chamber\nfrom which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such\nillustrations; the walls being completely covered with fresco paintings\nand bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich patterns,\nindicated the vast wealth of the deceased.\n\nThe treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same\ncondition in which Captain Sabretash had found it;--that is to say,\nthe coffin had not been disturbed. For eight years it had thus stood,\nsubject only externally to public inspection. We had now, therefore,\nthe complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very\nrarely the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident,\nat once that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good\nfortune.\n\nApproaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven\nfeet long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. It\nwas oblong--not coffin-shaped. The material was at first supposed to\nbe the wood of the sycamore (_platanus_), but, upon cutting into it, we\nfound it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, _papier mache_, composed\nof papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings, representing\nfuneral scenes, and other mournful subjects--interspersed among which,\nin every variety of position, were certain series of hieroglyphical\ncharacters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the departed. By good\nluck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no difficulty in\ntranslating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and represented the\nword _Allamistakeo_.\n\nWe had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury;\nbut having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second,\ncoffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one,\nbut resembling it precisely in every other respect. The interval between\nthe two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the\ncolors of the interior box.\n\nUpon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a\nthird case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no\nparticular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still\nemitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood. Between\nthe second and the third case there was no interval--the one fitting\naccurately within the other.\n\nRemoving the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself.\nWe had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or\nbandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath,\nmade of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and\npainted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the\nvarious supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different\ndivinities, with numerous identical human figures, intended, very\nprobably, as portraits of the persons embalmed. Extending from head\nto foot was a columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic\nhieroglyphics, giving again his name and titles, and the names and\ntitles of his relations.\n\nAround the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass\nbeads, diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities,\nof the scarabaeus, etc, with the winged globe. Around the small of the\nwaist was a similar collar or belt.\n\nStripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation,\nwith no perceptible odor. The color was reddish. The skin was hard,\nsmooth, and glossy. The teeth and hair were in good condition. The eyes\n(it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were\nvery beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat\ntoo determined a stare. The fingers and the nails were brilliantly\ngilded.\n\nMr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the\nembalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping\nthe surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of\nthe powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented\ngums became apparent.\n\nWe searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through\nwhich the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could\ndiscover none. No member of the party was at that period aware that\nentire or unopened mummies are not infrequently met. The brain it\nwas customary to withdraw through the nose; the intestines through an\nincision in the side; the body was then shaved, washed, and salted; then\nlaid aside for several weeks, when the operation of embalming, properly\nso called, began.\n\nAs no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor Ponnonner was preparing\nhis instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past\ntwo o’clock. Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination\nuntil the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present,\nwhen some one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.\n\nThe application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years\nold at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently\noriginal, and we all caught it at once. About one-tenth in earnest and\nnine-tenths in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor’s study, and\nconveyed thither the Egyptian.\n\nIt was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some\nportions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity\nthan other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of\ncourse, gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in\ncontact with the wire. This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive,\nand, with a hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each\nother good night, when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the\nMummy, were there immediately riveted in amazement. My brief glance, in\nfact, had sufficed to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed\nto be glass, and which were originally noticeable for a certain wild\nstare, were now so far covered by the lids, that only a small portion of\nthe _tunica albuginea_ remained visible.\n\nWith a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately\nobvious to all.\n\nI cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because “alarmed” is,\nin my case, not exactly the word. It is possible, however, that, but for\nthe Brown Stout, I might have been a little nervous. As for the rest\nof the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright\nfright which possessed them. Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied.\nMr. Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. Mr.\nSilk Buckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he\nmade his way, upon all fours, under the table.\n\nAfter the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter\nof course, upon further experiment forthwith. Our operations were now\ndirected against the great toe of the right foot. We made an incision\nover the outside of the exterior _os sesamoideum pollicis pedis,_ and\nthus got at the root of the abductor muscle. Readjusting the battery, we\nnow applied the fluid to the bisected nerves--when, with a movement of\nexceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to\nbring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the\nlimb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner,\nwhich had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a\ncatapult, through a window into the street below.\n\nWe rushed out _en masse_ to bring in the mangled remains of the victim,\nbut had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in an\nunaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more\nthan ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment\nwith vigor and with zeal.\n\nIt was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a\nprofound incision into the tip of the subject’s nose, while the Doctor\nhimself, laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact\nwith the wire.\n\nMorally and physically--figuratively and literally--was the effect\nelectric. In the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked very\nrapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime, in the\nsecond place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the fourth,\nit shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner’s face; in the fifth, turning to\nMessieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, it addressed them, in very capital\nEgyptian, thus:\n\n“I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at\nyour behavior. Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected. He\nis a poor little fat fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive him.\nBut you, Mr. Gliddon--and you, Silk--who have travelled and resided in\nEgypt until one might imagine you to the manner born--you, I say who\nhave been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I\nthink, as you write your mother tongue--you, whom I have always been\nled to regard as the firm friend of the mummies--I really did anticipate\nmore gentlemanly conduct from you. What am I to think of your standing\nquietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? What am I to suppose by\nyour permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins, and my\nclothes, in this wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to come to the\npoint) am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little\nvillain, Doctor Ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?”\n\nIt will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech\nunder the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into\nviolent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon. One of these three\nthings was, I say, to be expected. Indeed each and all of these lines of\nconduct might have been very plausibly pursued. And, upon my word, I am\nat a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor\nthe other. But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit\nof the age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and\nis now usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of\nparadox and impossibility. Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the\nMummy’s exceedingly natural and matter-of-course air that divested his\nwords of the terrible. However this may be, the facts are clear, and no\nmember of our party betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed\nto consider that any thing had gone very especially wrong.\n\nFor my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside,\nout of the range of the Egyptian’s fist. Doctor Ponnonner thrust his\nhands into his breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew\nexcessively red in the face. Mr. Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew\nup the collar of his shirt. Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put\nhis right thumb into the left corner of his mouth.\n\nThe Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and\nat length, with a sneer, said:\n\n“Why don’t you speak, Mr. Buckingham? Did you hear what I asked you, or\nnot? Do take your thumb out of your mouth!”\n\nMr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out\nof the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted\nhis left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.\n\nNot being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly\nto Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms\nwhat we all meant.\n\nMr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the\ndeficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would\nafford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of\nhis very excellent speech.\n\nI may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent\nconversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive\nEgyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other\nuntravelled members of the company)--through the medium, I say, of\nMessieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters. These gentlemen spoke\nthe mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I\ncould not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of\nimages entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger)\nthe two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of\nsensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning.\nMr. Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian\ncomprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon the wall, with\na bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows,\nstanding upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown\nforward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and\nthe mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees. Just in the same way Mr.\nBuckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea “wig,” until\n(at Doctor Ponnonner’s suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and\nconsented to take off his own.\n\nIt will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon’s discourse turned\nchiefly upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling\nand disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any\ndisturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the\nindividual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint\n(for it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little\nmatters were now explained, it might be as well to proceed with\nthe investigation intended. Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his\ninstruments.\n\nIn regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that\nAllamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I\ndid not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the\napologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with\nthe company all round.\n\nWhen this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in\nrepairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel.\nWe sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a\nsquare inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.\n\nIt was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of\nAllamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering--no doubt from the cold. The\nDoctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with\na black dress coat, made in Jennings’ best manner, a pair of sky-blue\nplaid pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of\nbrocade, a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with\nno brim, patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a\npair of whiskers, and a waterfall cravat. Owing to the disparity of size\nbetween the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one),\nthere was some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the\nperson of the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been\nsaid to be dressed. Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led\nhim to a comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell\nupon the spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.\n\nThe conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course,\nexpressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo’s\nstill remaining alive.\n\n“I should have thought,” observed Mr. Buckingham, “that it is high time\nyou were dead.”\n\n“Why,” replied the Count, very much astonished, “I am little more than\nseven hundred years old! My father lived a thousand, and was by no means\nin his dotage when he died.”\n\nHere ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of\nwhich it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly\nmisjudged. It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months\nsince he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.\n\n“But my remark,” resumed Mr. Buckingham, “had no reference to your age\nat the period of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are\nstill a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during\nwhich, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum.”\n\n“In what?” said the Count.\n\n“In asphaltum,” persisted Mr. B.\n\n“Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made\nto answer, no doubt--but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else\nthan the Bichloride of Mercury.”\n\n“But what we are especially at a loss to understand,” said Doctor\nPonnonner, “is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt\nfive thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so\ndelightfully well.”\n\n“Had I been, as you say, dead,” replied the Count, “it is more than\nprobable that dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the\ninfancy of Calvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common\nthing among us in the old days. But the fact is, I fell into catalepsy,\nand it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or\nshould be; they accordingly embalmed me at once--I presume you are aware\nof the chief principle of the embalming process?”\n\n“Why not altogether.”\n\n“Why, I perceive--a deplorable condition of ignorance! Well I cannot\nenter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to\nembalm (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the\nanimal functions subjected to the process. I use the word ‘animal’ in\nits widest sense, as including the physical not more than the moral\nand vital being. I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment\nconsisted, with us, in the immediately arresting, and holding in\nperpetual abeyance, all the animal functions subjected to the process.\nTo be brief, in whatever condition the individual was, at the period of\nembalmment, in that condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune\nto be of the blood of the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see\nme at present.”\n\n“The blood of the Scarabaeus!” exclaimed Doctor Ponnonner.\n\n“Yes. The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the ‘arms,’ of a very\ndistinguished and very rare patrician family. To be ‘of the blood of the\nScarabaeus,’ is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus\nis the insignium. I speak figuratively.”\n\n“But what has this to do with you being alive?”\n\n“Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before\nembalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone\ndid not coincide with the custom. Had I not been a Scarabeus, therefore,\nI should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is\ninconvenient to live.”\n\n“I perceive that,” said Mr. Buckingham, “and I presume that all the\nentire mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei.”\n\n“Beyond doubt.”\n\n“I thought,” said Mr. Gliddon, very meekly, “that the Scarabaeus was one\nof the Egyptian gods.”\n\n“One of the Egyptian _what?”_ exclaimed the Mummy, starting to its feet.\n\n“Gods!” repeated the traveller.\n\n“Mr. Gliddon, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,”\n said the Count, resuming his chair. “No nation upon the face of the\nearth has ever acknowledged more than one god. The Scarabaeus, the Ibis,\netc., were with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the\nsymbols, or media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too\naugust to be more directly approached.”\n\nThere was here a pause. At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor\nPonnonner.\n\n“It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,” said he,\n“that among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of\nthe Scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality?”\n\n“There can be no question of it,” replied the Count; “all the Scarabaei\nembalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now. Even some of those\npurposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and\nstill remain in the tomb.”\n\n“Will you be kind enough to explain,” I said, “what you mean by\n‘purposely so embalmed’?”\n\n“With great pleasure!” answered the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely\nthrough his eye-glass--for it was the first time I had ventured to\naddress him a direct question.\n\n“With great pleasure,” he said. “The usual duration of man’s life, in\nmy time, was about eight hundred years. Few men died, unless by most\nextraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer\nthan a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural\nterm. After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already\ndescribed it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable\ncuriosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of\nscience much advanced, by living this natural term in installments. In\nthe case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of\nthis kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained\nthe age of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then\nget himself carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors\npro tem., that they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of\na certain period--say five or six hundred years. Resuming existence at\nthe expiration of this time, he would invariably find his great work\nconverted into a species of hap-hazard note-book--that is to say, into\na kind of literary arena for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and\npersonal squabbles of whole herds of exasperated commentators.\nThese guesses, etc., which passed under the name of annotations, or\nemendations, were found so completely to have enveloped, distorted, and\noverwhelmed the text, that the author had to go about with a lantern to\ndiscover his own book. When discovered, it was never worth the trouble\nof the search. After re-writing it throughout, it was regarded as the\nbounden duty of the historian to set himself to work immediately\nin correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience, the\ntraditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally\nlived. Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification,\npursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of\npreventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said Doctor Ponnonner at this point, laying his\nhand gently upon the arm of the Egyptian--“I beg your pardon, sir, but\nmay I presume to interrupt you for one moment?”\n\n“By all means, sir,” replied the Count, drawing up.\n\n“I merely wished to ask you a question,” said the Doctor. “You mentioned\nthe historian’s personal correction of traditions respecting his own\nepoch. Pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were\nusually found to be right?”\n\n“The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered\nto be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written\nhistories themselves;--that is to say, not one individual iota of either\nwas ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and radically\nwrong.”\n\n“But since it is quite clear,” resumed the Doctor, “that at least five\nthousand years have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for\ngranted that your histories at that period, if not your traditions\nwere sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the\nCreation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten\ncenturies before.”\n\n“Sir!” said the Count Allamistakeo.\n\nThe Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional\nexplanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. The\nlatter at length said, hesitatingly:\n\n“The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel.\nDuring my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy\nas that the universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had\na beginning at all. I remember once, and once only, hearing something\nremotely hinted, by a man of many speculations, concerning the origin\n_of the human race;_ and by this individual, the very word _Adam_\n(or Red Earth), which you make use of, was employed. He employed\nit, however, in a generical sense, with reference to the spontaneous\ngermination from rank soil (just as a thousand of the lower genera of\ncreatures are germinated)--the spontaneous germination, I say, of five\nvast hordes of men, simultaneously upspringing in five distinct and\nnearly equal divisions of the globe.”\n\nHere, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or\ntwo of us touched our foreheads with a very significant air. Mr. Silk\nBuckingham, first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the\nsinciput of Allamistakeo, spoke as follows:\n\n“The long duration of human life in your time, together with\nthe occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in\ninstallments, must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general\ndevelopment and conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore, that\nwe are to attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in\nall particulars of science, when compared with the moderns, and more\nespecially with the Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the\nEgyptian skull.”\n\n“I confess again,” replied the Count, with much suavity, “that I am\nsomewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of\nscience do you allude?”\n\nHere our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the\nassumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.\n\nHaving heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few\nanecdotes, which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and\nSpurzheim had flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been\nnearly forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very\ncontemptible tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles\nof the Theban savans, who created lice and a great many other similar\nthings.\n\nI here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He\nsmiled rather contemptuously, and said they were.\n\nThis put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard\nto his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had\nnever as yet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information\non this head, I had better consult Ptolemy (whoever Ptolemy is), as well\nas one Plutarch de facie lunae.\n\nI then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in\ngeneral, about the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my\nqueries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow,\nand begged me for God’s sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus. As\nfor the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns\npossessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the\nstyle of the Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer\nthis question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very\nextraordinary way.\n\n“Look at our architecture!” he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of\nboth the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.\n\n“Look,” he cried with enthusiasm, “at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New\nYork! or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the\nCapitol at Washington, D. C.!”--and the good little medical man went\non to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he\nreferred. He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less\nthan four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.\n\nThe Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just\nat that moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal\nbuildings of the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night\nof Time, but the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of\nhis entombment, in a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes. He\nrecollected, however, (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to\nan inferior palace in a kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a\nhundred and forty-four columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and\ntwenty-five feet apart. The approach to this portico, from the Nile,\nwas through an avenue two miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and\nobelisks, twenty, sixty, and a hundred feet in height. The palace itself\n(as well as he could remember) was, in one direction, two miles long,\nand might have been altogether about seven in circuit. Its walls were\nrichly painted all over, within and without, with hieroglyphics. He\nwould not pretend to assert that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor’s\nCapitols might have been built within these walls, but he was by\nno means sure that two or three hundred of them might not have\nbeen squeezed in with some trouble. That palace at Carnac was an\ninsignificant little building after all. He (the Count), however, could\nnot conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity, magnificence, and\nsuperiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as described by the\nDoctor. Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever been seen in\nEgypt or elsewhere.\n\nI here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.\n\n“Nothing,” he replied, “in particular.” They were rather slight, rather\nill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of\ncourse, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which\nthe Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred\nand fifty feet in altitude.\n\nI spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.\n\nHe agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should\nhave gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the\nlittle palace at Carnac.\n\nThis question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea\nof Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon\nwinked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been\nrecently discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the\nGreat Oasis.\n\nI then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and\nasked me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on\nthe obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.\n\nThis disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the\nattack to Metaphysics. We sent for a copy of a book called the “Dial,”\n and read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very\nclear, but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress.\n\nThe Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in\nhis day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but\nit never progressed.\n\nWe then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and\nwere at much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the\nadvantages we enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and\nno king.\n\nHe listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little\namused. When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had\noccurred something of a very similar sort. Thirteen Egyptian provinces\ndetermined all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to\nthe rest of mankind. They assembled their wise men, and concocted the\nmost ingenious constitution it is possible to conceive. For a while they\nmanaged remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious.\nThe thing ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states,\nwith some fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable\ndespotism that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.\n\nI asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.\n\nAs well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.\n\nNot knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the\nEgyptian ignorance of steam.\n\nThe Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. The\nsilent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his\nelbows--told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once--and demanded\nif I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern steam-engine\nis derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de Caus.\n\nWe were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck\nwould have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue,\nand inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the\nmoderns in the all--important particular of dress.\n\nThe Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons,\nand then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up\nclose to his eyes for some minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth\nextended itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember\nthat he said any thing in the way of reply.\n\nHereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy\nwith great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as\na gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the\nmanufacture of either Ponnonner’s lozenges or Brandreth’s pills.\n\nWe looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer--but in vain. It was\nnot forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head. Never was\ntriumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a\ngrace. Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy’s\nmortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave.\n\nUpon getting home I found it past four o’clock, and went immediately\nto bed. It is now ten A.M. I have been up since seven, penning these\nmemoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind. The former I\nshall behold no more. My wife is a shrew. The truth is, I am heartily\nsick of this life and of the nineteenth century in general. I am\nconvinced that every thing is going wrong. Besides, I am anxious to\nknow who will be President in 2045. As soon, therefore, as I shave and\nswallow a cup of coffee, I shall just step over to Ponnonner’s and get\nembalmed for a couple of hundred years.\n\n","\nI've never been a fan of Mother's Day or Father's Day. Everyone knows they are just a scam for the Greeting Card companies to make money. Yet my mother always thrusts guilt upon me if I don't get her a card and a nice little present to go with it. I know, I sound like a rotten son for saying it, but I get the card and the gifts solely that I do not feel the 'guilt' that goes otherwise. You see me and my parents do not see eye to eye on many issues, our indifferences causing a huge rift in our relationship with each other. One of many such indifferences which led me to experiencing the trip report I am writing about now. Don't get me wrong, I do love my parents dearly, but sometimes their overbearing love for me becomes a bit too much, and a little bit of escapism is needed. This was one of those nights, escapism inside the Mini Noodle.\n\nI won't go into much detail of what set off our usual bickering, basically it was at a family reunion in which I was accused of not spending enough time with the relatives. I tried defending myself, Mom got a little too worked up about it and brought up other degrading insults into the mix. I grew silent and endured the heated drive back home, where upon returning, I swiftly left in my car to get away. I went to a friend's place where a few of my buddies were lounging, smoking weed and drinking Coronas.\n\nThe laid back environment calmed me down significantly, and soon I forgot all about that afternoon, smoking a few bowls and watching a movie on Satellite t.v. My friends were good company, but unfortunately I am the only night owl in the group. I was able to keep my friends conscious until about 2 am, when they all agreed it was late and parted ways.\n\nI was still unwilling to go back home just yet, so I searched for another thing to do. I then remembered my connect and good friend 'T,' would be off work around 3:30. If I could just kill time until then, I could meet up with him and then sample some more of his latest supply inside the Mini Noodle.\n\nThe Mini Noodle was my sanctuary, a place to kick back and forget about the real world when the going got tough. It simply was an old shed placed out in my friend's backyard which was retrofitted with couches, blacklights and a cheap stereo. It was designed to resemble a chillout room from a rave where me and my friends could unwind and do our drugs. We could get fairly noisy out there and the neighbors wouldn't complain. My friend's neighbors had their own reasons for not wanting to attract the cops. Besides, it wasn't like we were out there every night anyway.\n\nThe chillroom was built so that we could throw a couple of our own mini-raves at the residence, but for the most part, it was still just a shed that held couches and some various paraphanelia, as well as some tagged glow in the dark paint on the walls. It got its name, the 'Mini Noodle,' through the rave venue where I had first met my friends. The Noodle Factory it was called, nestled around a few ghetto parts of West Oakland.\n\nI remembered helping my friends paint the shed when it was getting its new look, and the paint job resembled part of one of the rooms inside the Noodle Factory, which happened to be as cramped and hot as the shed we were painting. One of us pointed this fact out, and we lovingly christened its name, ironically, through our displeasure of partying at the stuffy Noodle Factory. I loved the Mini Noodle, it was my home away from home. Even when the mini-raves stopped happening, I would usually be out there at least once a weekend, smoking a bowl, huffing nitrous, listening to some music or popping a pill. I put that place to good use, and intended to do so again tonight.\n\nI managed spending the next hour and a half driving around aimlessly through town, getting food to eat and loitering outside a few places. I found my friend T outside the Sports Bar he worked at, picked him up and headed to my other friend's place that housed the Mini Noodle. He was my friend's brother, and was living with him at the time, so he was basically getting a free ride home. I asked if he had anymore of the stuff in his possession. He said yes. I smiled. Now for most people, unwinding with a smoke and a few beers would be enough. For me, I felt a little change was in order. I needed something new on the menu, and this time, Ecstacy and Ketamine were the special combo of the day.\n\nI still had a green music note leftover from a party two months ago. I had only done K once, and that was a few days ago when T had given me a free sample after scoring some from a rave he went too last week. It was nothing like I had ever tried before. This time, I wanted to see what K and E could do together. After all, it wasn't like Ketamine was easy to find in this town, so now that it was available, I might as well do some experimenting. T had done that combination before, but wasn't too impressed with it. But he was curious to see what it would do to me. So was I.\n\nI popped the green music note at 4. I normally wouldn't drop so late at night, but these circumstances called for it. I've had an experience with green music notes before. They wouldn't start working til an hour and a half after consumption, the longest I've ever waited for a pill to hit. But once they hit, they worked well, and would leave off some visuals once you came down.\n\nNaturally I wanted to wait an hour and a half before doing a bag of K, so that both drugs would be working in synch. After all, it only takes about 10 minutes for the disassociative effects of K to kick in, and lasts for about an hour. Yes, I had researched the drug fairly well, and timed the duration on my cell phone when I did it a few nights ago. So me and T chilled inside the Mini Noodle, all blacklights turned on, passing the bong back and forth smoking some mediocre weed and talking about parties past.\n\nAt 40 minutes past T could not wait any longer. He pulled out a small red baggie and a cut straw and snorted up the premeasured 100 mg of ketamine hydrochloride inside. He sighed in delight and passed another bag and the straw to me, but I refused. My roll wasn't kicking in yet, I was only stoned and tired, but I was also growing anxious. Just my luck to be left with one pill that took so ridiculously long to hit. T laughed and played some Happy Hardcore. Not my type of music to listen too when taking a disassociative/psychedelic, I much prefer progressive house or psytrance during a trip, but it seemed to make T feel much more at home. I wasn't going to argue this time. I loved happy hardcore when I was rolling anyway, and hopefully I will be rolling soon.\n\n50 minutes past and still nothing but baked thoughts and a slight urge to dance. I had still been talking to T about various things, but the last question he answered, he seemed to get stuck, and stared at me for a few minutes before laughing. I could tell the K was getting hold of him, and I wanted to stay somewhere around his level. So when he offered me the bag and straw the second time around, I took it willingly.\n\nI emptied the bag at 4:50 with just a few strong whiffs, feeling like a disco stud. K goes up the nostrils so much smoother than cocaine. There's no numbness, no breathing out of only one nostril, just a slight tingle to it and it's gone. I poked my finger in the bag, gathered a few more particles and rubbed it on my gums. There was no significance to it, I was only being silly. It got a few more disjointed laughs from T.\n\n5 minutes later he gets up, and wobbles over to the couch to lie down. I say wobble, because walking becomes difficult once K works its magic. It's much better to lie down anyway, because having to stand can become quite distracting from the trip. At 5 am I found myself getting stuck as well. Basically it's just looking around the room and having my vision stop at one random place for a few minutes before I realize I've been staring at nothing for...how long? It becomes difficult telling time too. I could now feel the room slowly start to tilt from side to side, as if a giant was outside the Mini Noodle, rocking the place back and forth.\n\nI get up out of my chair and wave my arms in the air, struggling for balance. My spinal cord refuses to snap upright, so I wobble over to my couch, hunchbacked. I glance over to my right and T is already K'ed out, rocking out to the cheesy riffs of the hardcore. I drop on my couch like dead weight, rocking my head back and forth, becoming amazed at how heavy it feels. And there we lie, on our respective couches, for the next 40 minutes. I check my cellphone here and there to check the time, but soon the LED panel becomes too bright for me to read the display. So I lie there doing nothing, zoning in and out and having scattered thoughts that I forget about a few minutes after.\n\nAt 5:30 T gets up to change cd's with another happy hardcore album. He seems to be fairly sober now, and takes another rip out of the bong once the new cd plays. I'm coming out of my K trip as well, with nothing remarkable to really remember, much to my disappointment. Just as I thought, I had taken the K too early, and now I started to feel my jaw tighten up and the familiar MDMA-induced feelings tingle around my mind and body. Life can be so cruel sometimes, or can it? I turn to look at T with a slight smirk on my face, and ask him, 'Want to go halves on another bag?' T never hesitated.\n\n5:35 am, me and T take in another 50 mg (roughly) of our beloved substance. Neither one of us had fully comedown off the first bump yet, so there would still be some K running in our system as the 2nd bump came in. Before I lose my ability to walk again, I cache out what was left in the bong then promptly return to my seat. The E was coming on quite nicely, but the jaw clench was slightly distracting. If only I had some gum to chew. There was a half-full bottle of Aquafina on the table, so I drink some of that to keep myself hydrated.\n\n10 minutes later I'm wobbling back over to the couch Notre Dame style, this time noticing a difference in the intensity of the influence. My body had become dead weight again, but this time I had much more feeling. I could feel the individual hairs on my arms nestle around, and the itchy fabric of the couch had become softer, I could now feel all the different fibers rest around my skin. How strange it was, to feel all your muscles in your body become 10 times heavier, and yet have elevated feelings in touch.\n\n20 minutes after the 2nd K bump go by, and I can feel my body start to sweat a little. I try pulling my cell phone out to look at the time again, and I see that my phone had bent in an arc to the right. I now had to tilt my head to read the display, and even then my mind couldn't make sense of what it read. It looked familiar, but distant, unimportant. I throw the phone somewhere on the couch and run my fingers through my hair. Oh God, did it feel good, even though my hair felt more like a cheap wig, it still felt good to touch it.\n\nI look up at the ceiling, and all the normal pock marks and scratches are slowly moving forward. It became more like a conveyor belt than a ceiling, as the dents and marks would move forward, then disappear somehow, and come back to its original place, moving forward again. Soon the dents and marks began forming shapes of their own, moving on this upside down conveyor belt. I began to feel like Alice, plummeting down the rabbit hole, and as soon as I thought that, behold! A half visible face of the Cheshire Cat appeared to me, running along the conveyor belt. And as soon as I gasped in surprise, Cheshire grinned at me, before disappearing. Oh my God, it was happening. I was tripping out!\n\nI soon took my focus out of the conveyor belt ceiling, and looked around all the tagged, glow in the dark art covering the walls. It was all mostly neon green, but I saw that the letters were taking on a Life of their own. They were becoming 3-D. They could bend and twist around. They could stretch and shrink. They wanted to move, and this time the natural laws of the Earth couldn't stop them. The dancing letters became pleasant to look at, and I could feel my eyes rolling back in their sockets as the letters darted back and forth across the walls.\n\nThey started moving across the walls and floor so quickly that soon I became convinced that I was stuck inside the Matrix and could see all the green code scrolling by. It was a lightshow like no other, and I was loving it. Here and there I would try to grab one of the letters as they passed by, but my arms would not work right. It kept feeling like they would grow out 20 feet in length, and then I would have a hard time trying to ravel it back to its original length, much like winding up a garden hose. It was too weird of a feeling so I dropped them back on the couch in defeat.\n\nI looked back up at the ceiling to marvel at the Matrix code, but it had disappeared. The letters had gone back to their original places, but they looked foreign, I could still not understand what they read. I saw a little black speck walk across one of the letters, it looked like a small spider. As soon as I thought that, a giant glimmering silver web filled across my vision, and to my surprise, a silky strand of webbing had attached itself on every object in the room, including me. Seeing as I hate spiders, I did what I could to remove the strand of webbing off of myself, as hard as that was to do.\n\nAs soon as it left me, I felt a cold shock run through my body, as if I had been cut off from something vital. I began wondering if perhaps that what I saw was the Web of Life, and everything alive was attached to it, and to be cut off from it could only mean death. No that doesn't make sense. I am tripping, that is all. The air condensed all around me. The light bounced off the air in strange ways, making the air appear solid. What kind of solid reflects light in that way? Glass. Oh no, the air has turned into glass! I am suffocating! I could no longer breathe. All I could feel were sharp pieces of glass ripping into my lungs.\n\nHow could this have happened? There is no glass, you are tripping. Somehow, as chemically altered as my senses were, there was still this tiny, sane voice in my mind, reminding me of what I had taken. As soon as I remembered that I had taken K, the air became normal again. But as poor as my short term memory was that night, I would forget the voice, and start seeing things again.\n\nThe happy hardcore still playing in the background now sounded like it was slowed down, like it had become trance instead. The layers of sound in the tracks were no longer in synch, and so parts of the song would sound off. One lyric sprung into my mind, 'Jump onto your feet,' That sounded like a good idea. But how did one, jump onto their feet? That required movement of some sort right? Movement that I could no longer make. I still wanted to dance to the music, but I couldn't figure how to go about that anymore. Perhaps, if gravity offered a little assistance.\n\nAnd that's when the world tilted. I felt suddenly as if the couch had attached its bottom end onto the left wall and there was all this gravity that was now pushing on my left side, wanting me to fall on the floor, and yet somehow there I remained, glued onto the couch which was now glued onto the wall. And from there, fabrics began appearing everywhere. Various multi-patterned fabrics, as if they had been ripped from some larger material and were now being draped and layered together in random places.\n\nSoon the fabrics were everywhere, polka dots, stripes, labrynth shapes, and others in various degrees of opacity, forming a huge fabric montage in front of my very eyes. I didn't know what the Hell was going on anymore. And when it looked like I would now be suffocated from pounds of fabrics thrown on my body, everything went back to normal. The couch was back on the floor, the glow in the dark art was understandable once again, everything was back in its place. I must have blacked out.\n\nThe hardcore cd had ended and T seemed to have fallen asleep. I still felt very much cracked out and tired, and my jaw ached. I searched around the couch and find my phone. The display read 7:14 am. Wow, it was already morning. I was too tired to drive home, and too cracked out to sleep, so I laid there on the couch, for another hour, thinking of the things I had just experienced. Gradually I'm able to sleep again.\n\nAfter that night I decided to stay away from the Special K for a little while. I had read about its psychedelic effects, and after trying acid and shrooms, I knew I wanted to give this drug a shot. It did not disappoint, it was so radically different from the other psychedelics, it still amazes me to recall the things I saw inside the Mini Noodle that night. Not that I could discern any enlightenment from it, but an interesting experience nonetheless. Just one of many late nights, in the Mini Noodle. Oh yes, and I did get around to giving my mom her gift and card for Mother's Day. Business as usual. \n\n","My name is Jonas, I'm carrying the wheel.\nThanks for all you've shown us, but this is how we feel.\nCome sit next to me, pour yourself some tea.\nJust like grandma made, when we couldn't find sleep.\nThings were better then - once but never again.\nWe've all left the den.

This Chapter applies to standards-related measures of a Party, other than those covered by Section B of Chapter Seven (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade in goods or services between the Parties, and to measures of the Parties relating to such measures.\n2. Technical specifications prepared by governmental bodies for production or consumption requirements of such bodies shall be governed exclusively by Chapter Ten (Government Procurement).\nArticle 902: Extent of Obligations\n1. Article 105 (Extent of Obligations) does not apply to this Chapter.\n2. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure observance of Articles 904 through 908 by state or provincial governments and by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory.\nArticle 903: Affirmation of Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and Other Agreements\nFurther to Article 103 (Relation to Other Agreements), the Parties affirm with respect to each other their existing rights and obligations relating to standards-related measures under the GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and all other international agreements, including environmental and conservation agreements, to which those Parties are party.\nArticle 904: Basic Rights and Obligations\nRight to Take Standards-Related Measures\n1. Each Party may, in accordance with this Agreement, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure, including any such measure relating to safety, the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, and any measure to ensure its enforcement or implementation. Such measures include those to prohibit the importation of a good of another Party or the provision of a service by a service provider of another Party that fails to comply with the applicable requirements of those measures or to complete the Party's approval procedures.\nRight to Establish Level of Protection\n2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, each Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives of safety or the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, establish the levels of protection that it considers appropriate in accordance with Article 907(2).\nNon-Discriminatory Treatment\n3. Each Party shall, in respect of its standards-related measures, accord to goods and service providers of another Party:\n\n(a) national treatment in accordance with Article 301 (Market Access) or Article 1202 (Cross-Border Trade in Services); and\n(b) treatment no less favorable than that it accords to like goods, or in like circumstances to service providers, of any other country.\nUnnecessary Obstacles\n4. No Party may prepare, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure with a view to or with the effect of creating an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties. An unnecessary obstacle to trade shall not be deemed to be created where:\n\n(a) the demonstrable purpose of the measure is to achieve a legitimate objective; and\n(b) the measure does not operate to exclude goods of another Party that meet that legitimate objective.\nArticle 905: Use of International Standards\n1. Each Party shall use, as a basis for its standards-related measures, relevant international standards or international standards whose completion is imminent, except where such standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means to fulfill its legitimate objectives, for example because of fundamental climatic, geographical, technological or infrastructural factors, scientific justification or the level of protection that the Party considers appropriate.\n2. A Party's standards-related measure that conforms to an international standard shall be presumed to be consistent with Article 904(3) and (4).\n3. Nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, from adopting, maintaining or applying any standards-related measure that results in a higher level of protection than would be achieved if the measure were based on the relevant international standard.\nArticle 906: Compatibility and Equivalence\n1. Recognizing the crucial role of standards-related measures in achieving legitimate objectives, the Parties shall, in accordance with this Chapter, work jointly to enhance the level of safety and of protection of human, animal and plant life and health, the environment and consumers.\n2. Without reducing the level of safety or of protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, without prejudice to the rights of any Party under this Chapter, and taking into account international standardization activities, the Parties shall, to the greatest extent practicable, make compatible their respective standards-related measures, so as to facilitate trade in a good or service between the Parties.\n3. Further to Articles 902 and 905, a Party shall, on request of another Party, seek, through appropriate measures, to promote the compatibility of a specific standard or conformity assessment procedure that is maintained in its territory with the standards or conformity assessment procedures maintained in the territory of the other Party.\n4. Each importing Party shall treat a technical regulation adopted or maintained by an exporting Party as equivalent to its own where the exporting Party, in cooperation with the importing Party, demonstrates to the satisfaction of the importing Party that its technical regulation adequately fulfills the importing Party's legitimate objectives.\n5. The importing Party shall provide to the exporting Party, on request, its reasons in writing for not treating a technical regulation as equivalent under paragraph 4.\n6. Each Party shall, wherever possible, accept the results of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in the territory of another Party, provided that it is satisfied that the procedure offers an assurance, equivalent to that provided by a procedure it conducts or a procedure conducted in its territory the results of which it accepts, that the relevant good or service complies with the applicable technical regulation or standard adopted or maintained in the Party's territory.\n7. Prior to accepting the results of a conformity assessment procedure pursuant to paragraph 6, and to enhance confidence in the continued reliability of each other's conformity assessment results, the Parties may consult on such matters as the technical competence of the conformity assessment bodies involved, including verified compliance with relevant international standards through such means as accreditation.\nArticle 907: Assessment of Risk\n1. A Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, conduct an assessment of risk. In conducting an assessment, a Party may take into account, among other factors relating to a good or service:\n\n(a) available scientific evidence or technical information;\n(b) intended end uses;\n(c) processes or production, operating, inspection, sampling or testing methods; or\n(d) environmental conditions.\n2. Where pursuant to Article 904(2) a Party establishes a level of protection that it considers appropriate and conducts an assessment of risk, it should avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions between similar goods or services in the level of protection it considers appropriate, where the distinctions:\n\n(a) result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against goods or service providers of another Party;\n(b) constitute a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties; or\n(c) discriminate between similar goods or services for the same use under the same conditions that pose the same level of risk and provide similar benefits.\n3. Where a Party conducting an assessment of risk determines that available scientific evidence or other information is insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a provisional technical regulation on the basis of available relevant information. The Party shall, within a reasonable period after information sufficient to complete the assessment of risk is presented to it, complete its assessment, review and, where appropriate, revise the provisional technical regulation in the light of that assessment.\nArticle 908: Conformity Assessment\n1. The Parties shall, further to Article 906 and recognizing the existence of substantial differences in the structure, organization and operation of conformity assessment procedures in their respective territories, make compatible those procedures to the greatest extent practicable.\n2. Recognizing that it should be to the mutual advantage of the Parties concerned and except as set out in Annex 908.2, each Party shall accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize conformity assessment bodies in the territory of another Party on terms no less favorable than those accorded to conformity assessment bodies in its territory.\n3. Each Party shall, with respect to its conformity assessment procedures:\n\n(a) not adopt or maintain any such procedure that is stricter, nor apply the procedure more strictly, than necessary to give it confidence that a good or a service conforms with an applicable technical regulation or standard, taking into account the risks that non-conformity would create;\n(b) initiate and complete the procedure as expeditiously as possible;\n(c) in accordance with Article 904(3), undertake processing of applications in non-discriminatory order;\n(d) publish the normal processing period for each such procedure or communicate the anticipated processing period to an applicant on request;\n(e) ensure that the competent body\n\n(i) on receipt of an application, promptly examines the completeness of the documentation and informs the applicant in a precise and complete manner of any deficiency,\n(ii) transmits to the applicant as soon as possible the results of the conformity assessment procedure in a form that is precise and complete so that the applicant may take any necessary corrective action,\n(iii) where the application is deficient, proceeds as far as practicable with the procedure where the applicant so requests, and\n(iv) informs the applicant, on request, of the status of the application and the reasons for any delay;\n(f) limit the information the applicant is required to supply to that necessary to conduct the procedure and to determine appropriate fees;\n(g) accord confidential or proprietary information arising from, or supplied in connection with, the conduct of the procedure for a good of another Party or for a service provided by a person of another Party\n\n(i) the same treatment as that for a good of the Party or a service provided by a person of the Party, and\n(ii) in any event, treatment that protects an applicant's legitimate commercial interests to the extent provided under the Party's law;\n(h) ensure that any fee it imposes for conducting the procedure is no higher for a good of another Party or a service provider of another Party than is equitable in relation to any such fee imposed for its like goods or service providers or for like goods or service providers of any other country, taking into account communication, transportation and other related costs;\n(i) ensure that the location of facilities at which a conformity assessment procedure is conducted does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent;\n(j) limit the procedure, for a good or service modified subsequent to a determination that the good or service conforms to the applicable technical regulation or standard, to that necessary to determine that the good or service continues to conform to the technical regulation or standard; and\n(k) limit any requirement regarding samples of a good to that which is reasonable, and ensure that the selection of samples does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent.\n4. Each Party shall apply, with such modifications as may be necessary, the relevant provisions of paragraph 3 to its approval procedures.\n5. Each Party shall, on request of another Party, take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to facilitate access in its territory for conformity assessment activities.\n6.

Jane, his bride, you see, was somewhat older than\nAndrey; how much older I don't pretend to say; she was not one of our\nparish, and the register alone may be able to tell that.  But, at any\nrate, her being a little ahead of her young man in mortal years, coupled\nwith other bodily circumstances--'\n\n('Ah, poor thing!' sighed the women.)\n\n'--made her very anxious to get the thing done before he changed his\nmind; and 'twas with a joyful countenance (they say) that she, with\nAndrey and his brother and sister-in-law, marched off to church one\nNovember morning as soon as 'twas day a'most, to be made one with Andrey\nfor the rest of her life.  He had left our place long before it was\nlight, and the folks that were up all waved their lanterns at him, and\nflung up their hats as he went.\n\n'The church of her parish was a mile and more from the houses, and, as it\nwas a wonderful fine day for the time of year, the plan was that as soon\nas they were married they would make out a holiday by driving straight\noff to Port Bredy, to see the ships and the sea and the sojers, instead\nof coming back to a meal at the house of the distant relation she lived\nwi', and moping about there all the afternoon.\n\n'Well, some folks noticed that Andrey walked with rather wambling steps\nto church that morning; the truth o't was that his nearest neighbour's\nchild had been christened the day before, and Andrey, having stood\ngodfather, had stayed all night keeping up the christening, for he had\nsaid to himself, \"Not if I live to be thousand shall I again be made a\ngodfather one day, and a husband the next, and perhaps a father the next,\nand therefore I'll make the most of the blessing.\"  So that when he\nstarted from home in the morning he had not been in bed at all.  The\nresult was, as I say, that when he and his bride-to-he walked up the\nchurch to get married, the pa'son (who was a very strict man inside the\nchurch, whatever he was outside) looked hard at Andrey, and said, very\nsharp:\n\n'\"How's this, my man?  You are in liquor.  And so early, too.  I'm\nashamed of you!\"\n\n'\"Well, that's true, sir,\" says Andrey.  \"But I can walk straight enough\nfor practical purposes.  I can walk a chalk line,\" he says (meaning no\noffence), \"as well as some other folk: and--\" (getting hotter)--\"I reckon\nthat if you, Pa'son Billy Toogood, had kept up a christening all night so\nthoroughly as I have done, you wouldn't be able to stand at all; d--- me\nif you would!\"\n\n'This answer made Pa'son Billy--as they used to call him--rather spitish,\nnot to say hot, for he was a warm-tempered man if provoked, and he said,\nvery decidedly: \"Well, I cannot marry you in this state; and I will not!\nGo home and get sober!\"  And he slapped the book together like a\nrat-trap.\n\n'Then the bride burst out crying as if her heart would break, for very\nfear that she would lose Andrey after all her hard work to get him, and\nbegged and implored the pa'son to go on with the ceremony.  But no.\n\n'\"I won't be a party to your solemnizing matrimony with a tipsy man,\"\nsays Mr. Toogood.  \"It is not right and decent.  I am sorry for you, my\nyoung woman, but you'd better go home again.  I wonder how you could\nthink of bringing him here drunk like this!\"\n\n'\"But if--if he don't come drunk he won't come at all, sir!\" she says,\nthrough her sobs.\n\n'\"I can't help that,\" says the pa'son; and plead as she might, it did not\nmove him.  Then she tried him another way.\n\n'\"Well, then, if you'll go home, sir, and leave us here, and come back to\nthe church in an hour or two, I'll undertake to say that he shall be as\nsober as a judge,\" she cries.  \"We'll bide here, with your permission;\nfor if he once goes out of this here church unmarried, all Van Amburgh's\nhorses won't drag him back again!\"\n\n'\"Very well,\" says the parson.  \"I'll give you two hours, and then I'll\nreturn.\"\n\n'\"And please, sir, lock the door, so that we can't escape!\" says she.\n\n'\"Yes,\" says the parson.\n\n'\"And let nobody know that we are here.\"\n\n'The pa'son then took off his clane white surplice, and went away; and\nthe others consulted upon the best means for keeping the matter a secret,\nwhich it was not a very hard thing to do, the place being so lonely, and\nthe hour so early.  The witnesses, Andrey's brother and brother's wife,\nneither one o' which cared about Andrey's marrying Jane, and had come\nrather against their will, said they couldn't wait two hours in that hole\nof a place, wishing to get home to Longpuddle before dinner-time.  They\nwere altogether so crusty that the clerk said there was no difficulty in\ntheir doing as they wished.  They could go home as if their brother's\nwedding had actually taken place and the married couple had gone onward\nfor their day's pleasure jaunt to Port Bredy as intended, he, the clerk,\nand any casual passer-by would act as witnesses when the pa'son came\nback.\n\n'This was agreed to, and away Andrey's relations went, nothing loath, and\nthe clerk shut the church door and prepared to lock in the couple.  The\nbride went up and whispered to him, with her eyes a-streaming still.\n\n'\"My dear good clerk,\" she says, \"if we bide here in the church, folk may\nsee us through the winders, and find out what has happened; and 'twould\ncause such a talk and scandal that I never should get over it: and\nperhaps, too, dear Andrey might try to get out and leave me!  Will ye\nlock us up in the tower, my dear good clerk?\" she says.  \"I'll tole him\nin there if you will.\"\n\n'The clerk had no objection to do this to oblige the poor young woman,\nand they toled Andrey into the tower, and the clerk locked 'em both up\nstraightway, and then went home, to return at the end of the two hours.\n\n'Pa'son Toogood had not been long in his house after leaving the church\nwhen he saw a gentleman in pink and top-boots ride past his windows, and\nwith a sudden flash of heat he called to mind that the hounds met that\nday just on the edge of his parish.  The pa'son was one who dearly loved\nsport, and much he longed to be there.\n\n'In short, except o' Sundays and at tide-times in the week, Pa'son Billy\nwas the life o' the Hunt.  'Tis true that he was poor, and that he rode\nall of a heap, and that his black mare was rat-tailed and old, and his\ntops older, and all over of one colour, whitey-brown, and full o' cracks.\nBut he'd been in at the death of three thousand foxes.  And--being a\nbachelor man--every time he went to bed in summer he used to open the bed\nat bottom and crawl up head foremost, to mind 'em of the coming winter and\nthe good sport he'd have, and the foxes going to earth.  And whenever\nthere was a christening at the Squire's, and he had dinner there\nafterwards, as he always did, he never failed to christen the chiel over\nagain in a bottle of port wine.\n\n'Now the clerk was the parson's groom and gardener and jineral manager,\nand had just got back to his work in the garden when he, too, saw the\nhunting man pass, and presently saw lots more of 'em, noblemen and\ngentry, and then he saw the hounds, the huntsman, Jim Treadhedge, the\nwhipper-in, and I don't know who besides.  The clerk loved going to cover\nas frantical as the pa'son, so much so that whenever he saw or heard the\npack he could no more rule his feelings than if they were the winds of\nheaven.  He might be bedding, or he might be sowing--all was forgot.  So\nhe throws down his spade and rushes in to the pa'son, who was by this\ntime as frantical to go as he.\n\n'\"That there mare of yours, sir, do want exercise bad, very bad, this\nmorning!\" the clerk says, all of a tremble.  \"Don't ye think I'd better\ntrot her round the downs for an hour, sir?\"\n\n'\"To be sure, she does want exercise badly.  I'll trot her round myself,\"\nsays the parson.\n\n'\"Oh--you'll trot her yerself?  Well, there's the cob, sir.  Really that\ncob is getting oncontrollable through biding in a stable so long!  If you\nwouldn't mind my putting on the saddle--\"\n\n'\"Very well.  Take him out, certainly,\" says the pa'son, never caring\nwhat the clerk did so long as he himself could get off immediately.  So,\nscrambling into his riding-boots and breeches as quick as he could, he\nrode off towards the meet, intending to be back in an hour.  No sooner\nwas he gone than the clerk mounted the cob, and was off after him.  When\nthe pa'son got to the meet, he found a lot of friends, and was as jolly\nas he could be: the hounds found a'most as soon as they threw off, and\nthere was great excitement.  So, forgetting that he had meant to go back\nat once, away rides the pa'son with the rest o' the hunt, all across the\nfallow ground that lies between Lippet Wood and Green's Copse; and as he\ngalloped he looked behind for a moment, and there was the clerk close to\nhis heels.\n\n'\"Ha, ha, clerk--you here?\" he says.\n\n'\"Yes, sir, here be I,\" says t'other.\n\n'\"Fine exercise for the horses!\"\n\n'\"Ay, sir--hee, hee!\" says the clerk.\n\n'So they went on and on, into Green's Copse, then across to Higher\nJirton; then on across this very turnpike-road to Climmerston Ridge, then\naway towards Yalbury Wood: up hill and down dale, like the very wind, the\nclerk close to the pa'son, and the pa'son not far from the hounds.  Never\nwas there a finer run knowed with that pack than they had that day; and\nneither pa'son nor clerk thought one word about the unmarried couple\nlocked up in the church tower waiting to get j'ined.\n\n'\"These hosses of yours, sir, will be much improved by this!\" says the\nclerk as he rode along, just a neck behind the pa'son.  \"'Twas a happy\nthought of your reverent mind to bring 'em out to-day.  Why, it may be\nfrosty in a day or two, and then the poor things mid not be able to leave\nthe stable for weeks.\"\n\n'\"They may not, they may not, it is true.  A merciful man is merciful to\nhis beast,\" says the pa'son.\n\n'\"Hee, hee!\" says the clerk, glancing sly into the pa'son's eye.\n\n'\"Ha, ha!\" says the pa'son, a-glancing back into the clerk's.  \"Halloo!\"\nhe shouts, as he sees the fox break cover at that moment.\n\n'\"Halloo!\" cries the clerk.  \"There he goes!  Why, dammy, there's two\nfoxes--\"\n\n'\"Hush, clerk, hush!  Don't let me hear that word again!  Remember our\ncalling.\"\n\n'\"True, sir, true.  But really, good sport do carry away a man so, that\nhe's apt to forget his high persuasion!\"  And the next minute the corner\nof the clerk's eye shot again into the corner of the pa'son's, and the\npa'son's back again to the clerk's.  \"Hee, hee!\" said the clerk.\n\n'\"Ha, ha!\" said Pa'son Toogood.\n\n'\"Ah, sir,\" says the clerk again, \"this is better than crying Amen to\nyour Ever-and-ever on a winter's morning!\"\n\n'\"Yes, indeed, clerk!  To everything there's a season,\" says Pa'son\nToogood, quite pat, for he was a learned Christian man when he liked, and\nhad chapter and ve'se at his tongue's end, as a pa'son should.\n\n'At last, late in the day, the hunting came to an end by the fox running\ninto a' old woman's cottage, under her table, and up the clock-case.  The\npa'son and clerk were among the first in at the death, their faces\na-staring in at the old woman's winder, and the clock striking as he'd\nnever been heard to strik' before.  Then came the question of finding\ntheir way home.\n\n'Neither the pa'son nor the clerk knowed how they were going to do this,\nfor their beasts were wellnigh tired down to the ground.  But they\nstarted back-along as well as they could, though they were so done up\nthat they could only drag along at a' amble, and not much of that at a\ntime.\n\n'\"We shall never, never get there!\" groaned Mr. Toogood, quite bowed\ndown.\n\n'\"Never!\" groans the clerk.  \"'Tis a judgment upon us for our\niniquities!\"\n\n'\"I fear it is,\" murmurs the pa'son.\n\n'Well, 'twas quite dark afore they entered the pa'sonage gate, having\ncrept into the parish as quiet as if they'd stole a hammer, little\nwishing their congregation to know what they'd been up to all day long.\nAnd as they were so dog-tired, and so anxious about the horses, never\nonce did they think of the unmarried couple.  As soon as ever the horses\nhad been stabled and fed, and the pa'son and clerk had had a bit and a\nsup theirselves, they went to bed.\n\n'Next morning when Pa'son Toogood was at breakfast, thinking of the\nglorious sport he'd had the day before, the clerk came in a hurry to the\ndoor and asked to see him.\n\n'\"It has just come into my mind, sir, that we've forgot all about the\ncouple that we was to have married yesterday!\"\n\n'The half-chawed victuals dropped from the pa'son's mouth as if he'd been\nshot.  \"Bless my soul,\" says he, \"so we have!  How very awkward!\"\n\n'\"It is, sir; very.  Perhaps we've ruined the 'ooman!\"\n\n'\"Ah--to be sure--I remember!  She ought to have been married before.\"\n\n'\"If anything has happened to her up in that there tower, and no doctor\nor nuss--\"\n\n('Ah--poor thing!' sighed the women.)\n\n'\"--'twill be a quarter-sessions matter for us, not to speak of the\ndisgrace to the Church!\"\n\n'\"Good God, clerk, don't drive me wild!\" says the pa'son.  \"Why the hell\ndidn't I marry 'em, drunk or sober!\"  (Pa'sons used to cuss in them days\nlike plain honest men.)  \"Have you been to the church to see what\nhappened to them, or inquired in the village?\"\n\n'\"Not I, sir!  It only came into my head a moment ago, and I always like\nto be second to you in church matters.  You could have knocked me down\nwith a sparrer's feather when I thought o't, sir; I assure 'ee you\ncould!\"\n\n'Well, the parson jumped up from his breakfast, and together they went\noff to the church.\n\n'\"It is not at all likely that they are there now,\" says Mr. Toogood, as\nthey went; \"and indeed I hope they are not.  They be pretty sure to have\n'scaped and gone home.\"\n\n'However, they opened the church-hatch, entered the churchyard, and\nlooking up at the tower, there they seed a little small white face at the\nbelfry-winder, and a little small hand waving.  'Twas the bride.\n\n'\"God my life, clerk,\" says Mr. Toogood, \"I don't know how to face 'em!\"\nAnd he sank down upon a tombstone.  \"How I wish I hadn't been so cussed\nparticular!\"\n\n'\"Yes--'twas a pity we didn't finish it when we'd begun,\" the clerk said.\n\"Still, since the feelings of your holy priestcraft wouldn't let ye, the\ncouple must put up with it.\"\n\n'\"True, clerk, true!  Does she look as if anything premature had took\nplace?\"\n\n'\"I can't see her no lower down than her arm-pits, sir.\"\n\n'\"Well--how do her face look?\"\n\n'\"It do look mighty white!\"\n\n'\"Well, we must know the worst!  Dear me, how the small of my back do\nache from that ride yesterday! . . . But to more godly business!\"\n\n'They went on into the church, and unlocked the tower stairs, and\nimmediately poor Jane and Andrey busted out like starved mice from a\ncupboard, Andrey limp and sober enough now, and his bride pale and cold,\nbut otherwise as usual.\n\n'\"What,\" says the pa'son, with a great breath of relief, \"you haven't\nbeen here ever since?\"\n\n'\"Yes, we have, sir!\" says the bride, sinking down upon a seat in her\nweakness.  \"Not a morsel, wet or dry, have we had since!  It was\nimpossible to get out without help, and here we've stayed!\"\n\n'\"But why didn't you shout, good souls?\" said the pa'son.\n\n'\"She wouldn't let me,\" says Andrey.\n\n'\"Because we were so ashamed at what had led to it,\" sobs Jane.  \"We felt\nthat if it were noised abroad it would cling to us all our lives!  Once\nor twice Andrey had a good mind to toll the bell, but then he said: \"No;\nI'll starve first.  I won't bring disgrace on my name and yours, my\ndear.\"  And so we waited and waited, and walked round and round; but\nnever did you come till now!\"\n\n'\"To my regret!\" says the parson.  \"Now, then, we will soon get it over.\"\n\n'\"I--I should like some victuals,\" said Andrey, \"'twould gie me courage\nif it is only a crust o' bread and a' onion; for I am that leery that I\ncan feel my stomach rubbing against my backbone.\"\n\n'\"I think we had better get it done,\" said the bride, a bit anxious in\nmanner; \"since we are all here convenient, too!\"\n\n'Andrey gave way about the victuals, and the clerk called in a second\nwitness who wouldn't be likely to gossip about it, and soon the knot was\ntied, and the bride looked smiling and calm forthwith, and Andrey limper\nthan ever.\n\n'\"Now,\" said Pa'son Toogood, \"you two must come to my house, and have a\ngood lining put to your insides before you go a step further.\"\n\n'They were very glad of the offer, and went out of the churchyard by one\npath while the pa'son and clerk went out by the other, and so did not\nattract notice, it being still early.  They entered the rectory as if\nthey'd just come back from their trip to Port Bredy; and then they\nknocked in the victuals and drink till they could hold no more.\n\n'It was a long while before the story of what they had gone through was\nknown, but it was talked of in time, and they themselves laugh over it\nnow; though what Jane got for her pains was no great bargain after all.\n'Tis true she saved her name.'\n\n* * * * *\n\n'Was that the same Andrey who went to the squire's house as one of the\nChristmas fiddlers?' asked the seedsman.\n\n'No, no,' replied Mr. Profitt, the schoolmaster.  'It was his father did\nthat.  Ay, it was all owing to his being such a man for eating and\ndrinking.'  Finding that he had the ear of the audience, the schoolmaster\ncontinued without delay:--\n\n\n\nOLD ANDREY'S EXPERIENCE AS A MUSICIAN\n\n\n'I was one of the choir-boys at that time, and we and the players were to\nappear at the manor-house as usual that Christmas week, to play and sing\nin the hall to the squire's people and visitors (among 'em being the\narchdeacon, Lord and Lady Baxby, and I don't know who); afterwards going,\nas we always did, to have a good supper in the servants' hall.  Andrew\nknew this was the custom, and meeting us when we were starting to go, he\nsaid to us: \"Lord, how I should like to join in that meal of beef, and\nturkey, and plum-pudding, and ale, that you happy ones be going to just\nnow!  One more or less will make no difference to the squire.  I am too\nold to pass as a singing boy, and too bearded to pass as a singing girl;\ncan ye lend me a fiddle, neighbours, that I may come with ye as a\nbandsman?\"\n\n'Well, we didn't like to be hard upon him, and lent him an old one,\nthough Andrew knew no more of music than the Cerne Giant; and armed with\nthe instrument he walked up to the squire's house with the others of us\nat the time appointed, and went in boldly, his fiddle under his arm.  He\nmade himself as natural as he could in opening the music-books and moving\nthe candles to the best points for throwing light upon the notes; and all\nwent well till we had played and sung \"While shepherds watch,\" and \"Star,\narise,\" and \"Hark the glad sound.\"  Then the squire's mother, a tall\ngruff old lady, who was much interested in church-music, said quite\nunexpectedly to Andrew: \"My man, I see you don't play your instrument\nwith the rest.  How is that?\"\n\n'Every one of the choir was ready to sink into the earth with concern at\nthe fix Andrew was in.  We could see that he had fallen into a cold\nsweat, and how he would get out of it we did not know.\n\n'\"I've had a misfortune, mem,\" he says, bowing as meek as a child.\n\"Coming along the road I fell down and broke my bow.\"\n\n'\"Oh, I am sorry to hear that,\" says she.  \"Can't it be mended?\"\n\n'\"Oh no, mem,\" says Andrew.  \"'Twas broke all to splinters.\"\n\n'\"I'll see what I can do for you,\" says she.\n\n'And then it seemed all over, and we played \"Rejoice, ye drowsy mortals\nall,\" in D and two sharps.  But no sooner had we got through it than she\nsays to Andrew,\n\n'\"I've sent up into the attic, where we have some old musical\ninstruments, and found a bow for you.\"  And she hands the bow to poor\nwretched Andrew, who didn't even know which end to take hold of.  \"Now we\nshall have the full accompaniment,\" says she.\n\n'Andrew's face looked as if it were made of rotten apple as he stood in\nthe circle of players in front of his book; for if there was one person\nin the parish that everybody was afraid of, 'twas this hook-nosed old\nlady.  However, by keeping a little behind the next man he managed to\nmake pretence of beginning, sawing away with his bow without letting it\ntouch the strings, so that it looked as if he were driving into the tune\nwith heart and soul.  'Tis a question if he wouldn't have got through all\nright if one of the squire's visitors (no other than the archdeacon)\nhadn't noticed that he held the fiddle upside down, the nut under his\nchin, and the tail-piece in his hand; and they began to crowd round him,\nthinking 'twas some new way of performing.\n\n'This revealed everything; the squire's mother had Andrew turned out of\nthe house as a vile impostor, and there was great interruption to the\nharmony of the proceedings, the squire declaring he should have notice to\nleave his cottage that day fortnight.  However, when we got to the\nservants' hall there sat Andrew, who had been let in at the back door by\nthe orders of the squire's wife, after being turned out at the front by\nthe orders of the squire, and nothing more was heard about his leaving\nhis cottage.  But Andrew never performed in public as a musician after\nthat night; and now he's dead and gone, poor man, as we all shall be!'\n\n* * * * *\n\n'I had quite forgotten the old choir, with their fiddles and bass-viols,'\nsaid the home-comer, musingly.  'Are they still going on the same as of\nold?'\n\n'Bless the man!' said Christopher Twink, the master-thatcher; 'why,\nthey've been done away with these twenty year.  A young teetotaler plays\nthe organ in church now, and plays it very well; though 'tis not quite\nsuch good music as in old times, because the organ is one of them that go\nwith a winch, and the young teetotaler says he can't always throw the\nproper feeling into the tune without wellnigh working his arms off.'\n\n'Why did they make the change, then?'\n\n'Well, partly because of fashion, partly because the old musicians got\ninto a sort of scrape.  A terrible scrape 'twas too--wasn't it, John?  I\nshall never forget it--never!  They lost their character as officers of\nthe church as complete as if they'd never had any character at all.'\n\n'That was very bad for them.'\n\n'Yes.'  The master-thatcher attentively regarded past times as if they\nlay about a mile off, and went on:--\n\n","\n... me and her sister had somethin goin on\n(Aiyyo, would you listen to me motherfucker?)\nI reach my peak, I can't speak\nCall my nigga Cheek, tell him that my will is weak\n(Aiyyo c'mon nigga, cut that)\nI'm sick of niggaz lyin, I'm sick of bitches hawkin\n(Aiyyo, yoyo Big, aiyyo chill)\nMatter of fact, I'm sick of talkin\n\nDamn... we was spose to rule the world baby\nWe was unstoppable!\nThe shit can't be over, no\nThe shit can't be over man\nI know you hear me nigga\nI know you hear me\nYou got too much livin to do\nToo much unfinished business\nIt ain't over\nLive your life\n\nI'm sittin in the crib dreamin about Leer jets and coupes\nThe way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop\nOops!\nI'm interrupted by a doorbell\n3:52, who the hell\nIs this?\nI gets up quick\nCocks my shit\nStop the dogs from barkin\nThen proceed to walkin\nIts a face that I seen before\nMy nigga Sing, we used to sling on the sixteenth floor\nCheck it\nI look deeper\nI see blood up on his sneakers\nAnd his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth\nSo I dip\nNigga, is you creepin or speakin?\nHe tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the beacon\nI opens up the door, pitiful\nIs he in critical?\nRetaliation for this one won't be minimal\nCuz I'm a criminal\nWay before the rap shit\nBust a gat shit\nPuff won't even know what happened\nIf it's done smoothly\nSilencers on the Uzi\nStashed in the hooptie\nMy alibi, any cutie\nWith a booty that done fucked big Pop\nHead spinnin, reminiscin bout my man C-Rock\n\nSomebody's gotta die\nIf I go, you got to go\nSomebody's gotta die\nLet the gunshots blow\nSomebody's gotta die\nNobody got to know\nThat I killed yo ass in the mix, bitch\n\nFillin clips he explained our situation\nPrecisely, so we know exactly what we facin\nSome kid named Jason In a Honda station wagon\nWas braggin\nAbout how much loot and crack he stackin\nRock had a grip so they formed up a clique\nSmall crew\nRound the time I was locked up with you\nTrue indeed\nBut yo nigga let me proceed\nDon't fill them clips too high\nGive them bullets room to breathe\nDamn where was I?\nYeah\nOne night in town\nBlew the fuck up\nD-Rock went home\nAnd Jay got stuck the fuck up\nHit em twice\nGot em right on the Persian white\nPistol whipped his kids\nAnd taped up his wife\nHe said \"Yo Rock, set em up\", no question\nWet em up no less\nThan 50 shots in his direction\nHow many shots?\nMan nigga, I seen mad holes\nWhat kinda gats?\nHitch links, Cops, and Calicoles\nBut fuck that\nI know where all them niggaz rest at\nIn the buildin hustlin\nAnd they don't be strapped\nSupreme in black\nIs downstairs, the engine runnin\nFind a bag to put the guns in\nAnd c'mon if yo comin\n\nExchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down\nHow its gonna go down\nLay these niggas low-down\nSlow down\nFuck all that plannin shit\nRun up in they cribs\nAnd make them cats abandon ship\nSee niggas like you do ten year bids\nMiss the niggas they want\nAnd murder innocent kids\nNot I\nOne niggas in my eye\nThat's Jason\nAin't no slugs gonna be wasted\nRevenge I'm tastin at the tip of my lips\nI can't wait to feel my clip in his hips\nPass the chocolate\nThai\nSing ain't lie\nThere's Jason with his back to me\nTalkin to his faculty\nI start to get a funny feelins\nPut the mask on in case his niggas start squealin\nScream his name out\nSqueeze six nothing shorter\nNigga turned around holdin his daughter\n\nUh, uh, uh, c'mon\n\nHah, sicka than your average Poppa\nTwist cabbage off instinct niggaz don't think shit stink\nPink gators, my Detroit players\nTimbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn\n\nDead right, if they head right, Biggie there every night\nPoppa been smooth since days of Underoos\nNever lose, never choose to bruise crews who\nDo something to us, talk go through us\n\nGirls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us\nWho us?

We had here around\nus all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling\nin the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books,\nwe should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful\nintelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city.\nNot a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some\nacquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily\nthe loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every\nmessenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.\nThat palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I\ncould neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was\nof a less excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in\nspirits, exerted himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical\nintellect was not at any time affected by unrealities. To the substances\nof terror he was sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no\napprehension.\n\nHis endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into\nwhich I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain\nvolumes which I had found in his library. These were of a character to\nforce into germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition\nlay latent in my bosom. I had been reading these books without his\nknowledge, and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible\nimpressions which had been made upon my fancy.\n\nA favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens--a belief\nwhich, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed\nto defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions--he\nmaintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,--I\ncontending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneity-\nthat is to say, without apparent traces of suggestion--had in itself the\nunmistakable elements of truth, and was entitled to as much respect\nas that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of\ngenius.\n\nThe fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had\noccurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had\nin it so much of the portentous character, that I might well have been\nexcused for regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time\nso confounded and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could\nmake up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend.\n\nNear the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at\nan open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a\nview of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been\ndenuded by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its\ntrees. My thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to\nthe gloom and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes\nfrom the page, they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an\nobject--upon some living monster of hideous conformation, which very\nrapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally\nin the dense forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I\ndoubted my own sanity--or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and\nmany minutes passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was\nneither mad nor in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which\nI distinctly saw, and calmly surveyed through the whole period of\nits progress), my readers, I fear, will feel more difficulty in being\nconvinced of these points than even I did myself.\n\nEstimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of\nthe large trees near which it passed--the few giants of the forest which\nhad escaped the fury of the land-slide--I concluded it to be far larger\nthan any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line, because\nthe shape of the monster suggested the idea--the hull of one of our\nseventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the general\noutline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a\nproboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as\nthe body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was\nan immense quantity of black shaggy hair--more than could have been\nsupplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this\nhair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike\nthose of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending\nforward, parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a\ngigantic staff, thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure\ncrystal and in shape a perfect prism,--it reflected in the most gorgeous\nmanner the rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a\nwedge with the apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs\nof wings--each wing nearly one hundred yards in length--one pair being\nplaced above the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each\nscale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that\nthe upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But\nthe chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a\nDeath’s Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and\nwhich was as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of\nthe body, as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While\nI regarded the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance\non its breast, with a feeling or horror and awe--with a sentiment of\nforthcoming evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of\nthe reason, I perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis\nsuddenly expand themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so\nloud and so expressive of wo, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell\nand as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once,\nfainting, to the floor.\n\nUpon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend\nof what I had seen and heard--and I can scarcely explain what feeling of\nrepugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.\n\nAt length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we\nwere sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition--I\noccupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa\nnear at hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to\ngive him an account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end--at first\nlaughed heartily--and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as\nif my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again\nhad a distinct view of the monster--to which, with a shout of absolute\nterror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly--but maintained\nthat he saw nothing--although I designated minutely the course of the\ncreature, as it made its way down the naked face of the hill.\n\nI was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an\nomen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I\nthrew myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried\nmy face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no\nlonger apparent.\n\nMy host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his\ndemeanor, and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the\nconformation of the visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied\nhim on this head, he sighed deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable\nburden, and went on to talk, with what I thought a cruel calmness, of\nvarious points of speculative philosophy, which had heretofore formed\nsubject of discussion between us. I remember his insisting very\nespecially (among other things) upon the idea that the principle\nsource of error in all human investigations lay in the liability of\nthe understanding to under-rate or to over-value the importance of an\nobject, through mere mis-admeasurement of its propinquity. “To estimate\nproperly, for example,” he said, “the influence to be exercised on\nmankind at large by the thorough diffusion of Democracy, the distance\nof the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accomplished should\nnot fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can you tell me one writer\non the subject of government who has ever thought this particular branch\nof the subject worthy of discussion at all?”\n\nHe here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth\none of the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to\nexchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine\nprint of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the\nbook, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.\n\n“But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the\nmonster, I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you\nwhat it was. In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy\naccount of the genus Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order\nLepidoptera, of the class of Insecta--or insects. The account runs thus:\n\n“‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic\nappearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation\nof the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of\nmandibles and downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior\nby a stiff hair; antennae in the form of an elongated club, prismatic;\nabdomen pointed, The Death’s--headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror\namong the vulgar, at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it\nutters, and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”\n\nHe here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing\nhimself accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of\nbeholding “the monster.”\n\n“Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed--“it is reascending the face\nof the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.\nStill, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,--for\nthe fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some\nspider has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the\nsixteenth of an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth\nof an inch distant from the pupil of my eye.”\n\n","\n“LET us hurry to the walls,” said Abel-Phittim to Buzi-Ben-Levi and\nSimeon the Pharisee, on the tenth day of the month Thammuz, in the year\nof the world three thousand nine hundred and forty-one--let us hasten\nto the ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin, which is in the city of\nDavid, and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised; for it is the\nlast hour of the fourth watch, being sunrise; and the idolaters, in\nfulfilment of the promise of Pompey, should be awaiting us with the\nlambs for the sacrifices.”\n\nSimeon, Abel-Phittim, and Duzi-Ben-Levi were the Gizbarim, or\nsub-collectors of the offering, in the holy city of Jerusalem.\n\n“Verily,” replied the Pharisee; “let us hasten: for this generosity\nin the heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an\nattribute of the worshippers of Baal.”\n\n“‘That they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the\nPentateuch,” said Buzi-Ben-Levi, “but that is only toward the people\nof Adonai. When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to\ntheir own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to\nallow us lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof\nthirty silver shekels per head!”\n\n“Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,” replied Abel-Phittim, “that the\nRoman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High,\nhas no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the\naltar, to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.”\n\n“Now, by the five corners of my beard!” shouted the Pharisee, who\nbelonged to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints\nwhose manner of _dashing _and lacerating the feet against the\npavement was long a thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees-a\nstumbling-block to less gifted perambulators)--“by the five corners of\nthat beard which, as a priest, I am forbidden to shave!-have we lived\nto see the day when a blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall\naccuse us of appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy\nand consecrated elements? Have we lived to see the day when--“’\n\n“Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,” interrupted\nAbel-Phittim’ “for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice\nor by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest\nofferings should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of\nheaven can not extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can\nturn aside.”\n\nThat part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and\nwhich bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most\nstrongly fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep\nand lofty hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench,\nhewn from the solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength\nerected upon its inner edge. This wall was adorned, at regular\ninterspaces, by square towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the\nhighest one hundred and twenty cubits in height. But, in the vicinity of\nthe gate of Benjamin, the wall arose by no means from the margin of the\nfosse. On the contrary, between the level of the ditch and the basement\nof the rampart sprang up a perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty\ncubits, forming part of the precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when\nSimeon and his associates arrived on the summit of the tower called\nAdoni-Bezek-the loftiest of all the turrets around about Jerusalem, and\nthe usual place of conference with the besieging army-they looked down\nupon the camp of the enemy from an eminence excelling by many feet that\nof the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by several, that of the temple of Belus.\n\n“Verily,” sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice,\n“the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore-as the locusts\nin the wilderness! The valley of the King hath become the valley of\nAdommin.”\n\n“And yet,” added Ben-Levi, “thou canst not point me out a Philistine-no,\nnot one-from Aleph to Tau-from the wilderness to the battlements--who\nseemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!”\n\n“Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a\nRoman soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the\nregions of Pluto--“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it\nhas broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it thus you evince\nyour gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has\nthought fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? The god Phoebus,\nwho is a true god, has been charioted for an hour-and were you not to\nbe on the ramparts by sunrise? Aedepol! do you think that we, the\nconquerors of the world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by\nthe walls of every kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower\naway! I say--and see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in\nweight!”\n\n“El Elohim!” ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of the\ncenturion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away\nagainst the temple--“El Elohim!--who is the god Phoebus?--whom doth the\nblasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in the laws of\nthe Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the\nTeraphim!--is it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?---or\nAshimah?--or Nibhaz,--or Tartak?--or Adramalech?--or Anamalech?--or\nSuccoth-Benith?--or Dagon?--or Belial?--or Baal-Perith?--or\nBaal-Peor?--or Baal-Zebub?”\n\n“Verily it is neither-but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too\nrapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance to hang\non the projection of Yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of\nthe holy things of the sanctuary.”\n\nBy the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily\nladen basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and,\nfrom the giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen gathering confusedly\nround it; but owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no\ndistinct view of their operations could be obtained.\n\nHalf an hour had already elapsed.\n\n“We shall be too late!” sighed the Pharisee, as at the expiration of\nthis period he looked over into the abyss-“we shall be too late! we\nshall be turned out of office by the Katholim.”\n\n “No more,” responded Abel-Phittim---“no more shall we feast upon the fat\nof the land-no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense--our\nloins girded up with fine linen from the Temple.”\n\n“Racal” swore Ben-Levi, “Racal do they mean to defraud us of the\npurchase money? or, Holy Moses! are they weighing the shekels of the\ntabernacle?”\n\n“They have given the signal at last!” cried the Pharisee-----“they\nhave given the signal at last! pull away, Abel-Phittim!--and thou,\nBuzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!--for verily the Philistines have either still\nhold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts to place\ntherein a beast of good weight!” And the Gizbarim pulled away, while\ntheir burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.\n\n“Booshoh he!”--as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at the\nextremity of the rope became indistinctly visible--“Booshoh he!” was the\nexclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.\n\n*****\n\n“Booshoh he!--for shame!--it is a ram from the thickets of Engedi, and as\nrugged as the valley of jehosaphat!”\n\n“It is a firstling of the flock,” said Abel-Phittim, “I know him by the\nbleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. His eyes\nare more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral, and his flesh is\nlike the honey of Hebron.”\n\n“It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan,” said the Pharisee,\n“the heathen have dealt wonderfully with us----let us raise up\nour voices in a psalm--let us give thanks on the shawm and on the\npsaltery-on the harp and on the huggab-on the cythern and on the\nsackbut!”\n\nIt was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the\nGizbarim that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a hog of no\ncommon size.\n\n“Now El Emanu!” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio, as,\nletting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the\nPhilistines, “El Emanu!-God be with us--it is _the unutterable flesh!”_\n\n","“SHE said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,” cried\nthe young Student; “but in all my garden there is no red rose.”\n\nFrom her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she\nlooked out through the leaves, and wondered.\n\n“No red rose in all my garden!” he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled\nwith tears.  “Ah, on what little things does happiness depend!  I have\nread all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of\nphilosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made\nwretched.”\n\n“Here at last is a true lover,” said the Nightingale.  “Night after night\nhave I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told\nhis story to the stars, and now I see him.  His hair is dark as the\nhyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but\npassion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal\nupon his brow.”\n\n“The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,” murmured the young Student,\n“and my love will be of the company.  If I bring her a red rose she will\ndance with me till dawn.  If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in\nmy arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will\nbe clasped in mine.  But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall\nsit lonely, and she will pass me by.  She will have no heed of me, and my\nheart will break.”\n\n“Here indeed is the true lover,” said the Nightingale.  “What I sing of,\nhe suffers—what is joy to me, to him is pain.  Surely Love is a wonderful\nthing.  It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.\nPearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the\nmarketplace.  It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be\nweighed out in the balance for gold.”\n\n“The musicians will sit in their gallery,” said the young Student, “and\nplay upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound\nof the harp and the violin.  She will dance so lightly that her feet will\nnot touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng\nround her.  But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to\ngive her”; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in\nhis hands, and wept.\n\n“Why is he weeping?” asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with\nhis tail in the air.\n\n“Why, indeed?” said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a\nsunbeam.\n\n“Why, indeed?” whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.\n\n“He is weeping for a red rose,” said the Nightingale.\n\n“For a red rose?” they cried; “how very ridiculous!” and the little\nLizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.\n\nBut the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student’s sorrow, and\nshe sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.\n\nSuddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.\nShe passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed\nacross the garden.\n\nIn the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and\nwhen she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.\n\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\n\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\n“My roses are white,” it answered; “as white as the foam of the sea, and\nwhiter than the snow upon the mountain.  But go to my brother who grows\nround the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.”\n\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the\nold sun-dial.\n\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\n\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\n“My roses are yellow,” it answered; “as yellow as the hair of the\nmermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil\nthat blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.  But go\nto my brother who grows beneath the Student’s window, and perhaps he will\ngive you what you want.”\n\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath\nthe Student’s window.\n\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\n\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\n“My roses are red,” it answered, “as red as the feet of the dove, and\nredder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the\nocean-cavern.  But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has\nnipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no\nroses at all this year.”\n\n“One red rose is all I want,” cried the Nightingale, “only one red rose!\nIs there no way by which I can get it?”\n\n“There is a way,” answered the Tree; “but it is so terrible that I dare\nnot tell it to you.”\n\n“Tell it to me,” said the Nightingale, “I am not afraid.”\n\n“If you want a red rose,” said the Tree, “you must build it out of music\nby moonlight, and stain it with your own heart’s-blood.  You must sing to\nme with your breast against a thorn.  All night long you must sing to me,\nand the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into\nmy veins, and become mine.”\n\n“Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,” cried the Nightingale,\n“and Life is very dear to all.  It is pleasant to sit in the green wood,\nand to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot\nof pearl.  Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the\nbluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the\nhill.  Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird\ncompared to the heart of a man?”\n\nSo she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.  She\nswept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through\nthe grove.\n\nThe young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him,\nand the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.\n\n“Be happy,” cried the Nightingale, “be happy; you shall have your red\nrose.  I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my\nown heart’s-blood.  All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a\ntrue lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and\nmightier than Power, though he is mighty.  Flame-coloured are his wings,\nand coloured like flame is his body.  His lips are sweet as honey, and\nhis breath is like frankincense.”\n\nThe Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not\nunderstand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the\nthings that are written down in books.\n\nBut the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the\nlittle Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.\n\n“Sing me one last song,” he whispered; “I shall feel very lonely when you\nare gone.”\n\nSo the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water\nbubbling from a silver jar.\n\nWhen she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book\nand a lead-pencil out of his pocket.\n\n“She has form,” he said to himself, as he walked away through the\ngrove—“that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?  I am\nafraid not.  In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without\nany sincerity.  She would not sacrifice herself for others.  She thinks\nmerely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.  Still,\nit must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.  What\na pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.”\nAnd he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and\nbegan to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.\n\nAnd when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the\nRose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.  All night long she sang\nwith her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down\nand listened.  All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and\ndeeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.\n\nShe sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.\nAnd on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous\nrose, petal following petal, as song followed song.  Pale was it, at\nfirst, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the\nmorning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.  As the shadow of a rose in\na mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the\nrose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.\n\nBut the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.\n“Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day will come\nbefore the rose is finished.”\n\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and\nlouder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of\na man and a maid.\n\nAnd a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the\nflush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.\nBut the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose’s heart remained\nwhite, for only a Nightingale’s heart’s-blood can crimson the heart of a\nrose.\n\nAnd the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.\n“Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day will come\nbefore the rose is finished.”\n\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn\ntouched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.  Bitter,\nbitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of\nthe Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the\ntomb.\n\nAnd the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.\nCrimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.\n\nBut the Nightingale’s voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to\nbeat, and a film came over her eyes.  Fainter and fainter grew her song,\nand she felt something choking her in her throat.\n\nThen she gave one last burst of music.  The white Moon heard it, and she\nforgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.  The red rose heard it, and\nit trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold\nmorning air.  Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke\nthe sleeping shepherds from their dreams.  It floated through the reeds\nof the river, and they carried its message to the sea.\n\n“Look, look!” cried the Tree, “the rose is finished now”; but the\nNightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass,\nwith the thorn in her heart.\n\nAnd at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.\n\n“Why, what a wonderful piece of luck!” he cried; “here is a red rose!  I\nhave never seen any rose like it in all my life.  It is so beautiful that\nI am sure it has a long Latin name”; and he leaned down and plucked it.\n\nThen he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor’s house with the rose\nin his hand.\n\nThe daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue\nsilk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.\n\n“You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,”\ncried the Student.  “Here is the reddest rose in all the world.  You will\nwear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell\nyou how I love you.”\n\nBut the girl frowned.\n\n“I am afraid it will not go with my dress,” she answered; “and, besides,\nthe Chamberlain’s nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody\nknows that jewels cost far more than flowers.”\n\n“Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,” said the Student angrily;\nand he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and\na cart-wheel went over it.\n\n“Ungrateful!” said the girl.  “I tell you what, you are very rude; and,\nafter all, who are you?  Only a Student.  Why, I don’t believe you have\neven got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain’s nephew has”;\nand she got up from her chair and went into the house.\n\n“What a silly thing Love is,” said the Student as he walked away.  “It\nis not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is\nalways telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one\nbelieve things that are not true.  In fact, it is quite unpractical, and,\nas in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to\nPhilosophy and study Metaphysics.”\n\nSo he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began\nto read.\n\n","Thank you guys for having us over.\nOh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.\nYeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.\nWell, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.\nYou mean that Portuguese couple?

I'm gonna make them stay here.\nYou're a strange kind of grown-up.\nJoey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...\nWoo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?\nAll right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.\nHey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know.

See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. You're fun.\nYou need to fill out this form.\nOkay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly.

So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.\nThat's what we were gonna name the baby.\nPhoebe!\nUh! Princess Consuela.\nYou seriously changed your name to that?\nUh-huh!\nOkay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?\nUhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.\nHey, how'd the interview go?\nOh! It's not good.\nYou know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.\nWell, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.\nThat is a bad interview.\nWhat are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?\nWell, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said \"Wait a minute! Yes I am.\" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.\nOh God. I'm so sorry.\nHey! Wha-hoo! What's this? Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?\nRoss...\nI guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!\nAll\nThis is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!\nSix?

I-I-I-I can feel it.\nCan you?\nAh, all right. Here's to Ross!\nAnd-and to years of hard work finally paying off.\nAnd to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.\nBut also knowing it means a lot.\nBut more importantly to full well-rounded lives.\n...that center around work.\nTo Ross!\nAll : Ross!\nYou know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.\nOh God!\nNo seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.\nNo, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.\nRach, I'm so sorry.\nOh!\nGreat. I feel like an idiot.\nNo, it's okay, you didn't know.\nOh... Little heads-up would have been nice.\nThank you for letting us see the house again.\nAnd thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.\nTake as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through.\nAh, so glad you decided to come.\nMe too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.\nWhat?\nFungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.\nNo it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.\nOkay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.\nMaybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.\nMaybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.\nNo it's not!\nAre you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!\nWhen your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?\nMaybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.\nOh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.\nFINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay?

If you love it, I love it.\nI do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.\nAnd I love Crap.\nOw!\nWho are you?\nOh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?\nI'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.\nOh.\nI hate my parents.\nI hate my friends. Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.\nLike what?\nUhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!\nWhat are you? Eight?\nWoah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.\nI don't have any great ideas. I am eight.\nAhh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?\nI really don't.\nWhat am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.\nMy parents say I'm gonna make new friends.\nOh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.\nThis is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners. Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?\nYeah, yeah, I guess.\nWell, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?\nYeah, maybe.\nThen you gotta let them go.\nI hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?\nI read a lot.\nHey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry.\nOh, thank you...\nYou still don't know my name, do you?Ross, what is taking you so long?\nI'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!\nRachel?How've you been?\nI'm fantastic. You remember Ross?\nSure, sure.\nUh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...\nClever. So how are you?\nOh, well, you're not catching me on my best day.\nYeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion.\nNo, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.\nAre you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.\nWell, screw charity work. What've you got?\nWhy don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?\nGreat! I'll call ya!\nNice to see you.\nYeah! yeah, I got tenure!\nOh my God!\nSee? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?\nRoss! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.\nThat is Mark?\nYes.\nI hate that guy.\nOh.\nNo, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.\nWhat? You don't want me to get a job?\nOh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.\nUgh.\nI'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?\nRoss, you know what?\nOh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.\nMan, those two dogs are going at it!\nHey!\nHey.\nHey, where have you been?\nOh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.\nReally? What changed your mind?\nOh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.\nJoey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.\nWhat?\nHa! I'm just messing with you.\nThat's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!\nJoey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?\nWhat? I get my own room?\nYou don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?\nOh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?\nNo!\nWhy not? I'll keep the tank clean.\nAfter you, miss Banana Hammock.\nThank you, mister Bag.\nOh hey, how are you?\nOh hi Rita! Good! Oh, Rita's a massage client.\nOh! Why don't you introduce me?\nEr, Rita, this is my husband.\nOh!\nYeah.\nWhy don't you tell her my name?\nThis is my husband Crap Bag.\nCrap Bag?\nIf you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.\nOkay. Excuse me...\nYeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?\nOnly if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.\nHow about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?\nReally?\nYeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.\nDo you even know what a banana hammock is?\nIt's a funny word.\nIt's a Speedo.\n...Oh crap!\nHey, is Rachel here?\nNo.\nShe's still at dinner?\nI guess. Why? Who's she with?\nThat guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.\nIt's seven years ago. My time machine works!\nWe ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.\nSo what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.\nExcuse me?\nOh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.\nFor your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.\nOh, sorry!\nHi you guys!\nHey, so uhm... How was dinner?\nOh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.\nOh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?\nOh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.\nShould we send something?\nHow did the job stuff go?\nHe offered me one.\nThat's great!\nCongratulations!\nI know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...\nCan we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.\nThe job is in Paris.\nI mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?\nMackenzie:\nHey bear, I need some career advice.\n","IT’S on my visiting cards sure enough (and it’s them that’s all o’\npink satin paper) that inny gintleman that plases may behould the\nintheristhin words, “Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, 39 Southampton\nRow, Russell Square, Parrish o’ Bloomsbury.” And shud ye be wantin’ to\ndiskiver who is the pink of purliteness quite, and the laider of the hot\ntun in the houl city o’ Lonon--why it’s jist mesilf.

Isn’t it my own swate silf now that’ll missure the six fut, and\nthe three inches more nor that, in me stockins, and that am excadingly\nwill proportioned all over to match? And it is ralelly more than three\nfut and a bit that there is, inny how, of the little ould furrener\nFrinchman that lives jist over the way, and that’s a oggling and\na goggling the houl day, (and bad luck to him,) at the purty widdy\nMisthress Tracle that’s my own nixt-door neighbor, (God bliss her!)\nand a most particuller frind and acquaintance? You percave the little\nspalpeen is summat down in the mouth, and wears his lift hand in a\nsling, and it’s for that same thing, by yur lave, that I’m going to give\nyou the good rason.\n\nThe truth of the houl matter is jist simple enough; for the very first\nday that I com’d from Connaught, and showd my swate little silf in the\nstrait to the widdy, who was looking through the windy, it was a\ngone case althegither with the heart o’ the purty Misthress Tracle.\nI percaved it, ye see, all at once, and no mistake, and that’s God’s\ntruth. First of all it was up wid the windy in a jiffy, and thin she\nthrew open her two peepers to the itmost, and thin it was a little gould\nspy-glass that she clapped tight to one o’ them and divil may burn me\nif it didn’t spake to me as plain as a peeper cud spake, and says it,\nthrough the spy-glass: “Och! the tip o’ the mornin’ to ye, Sir Pathrick\nO’Grandison, Barronitt, mavourneen; and it’s a nate gintleman that ye\nare, sure enough, and it’s mesilf and me forten jist that’ll be at yur\nsarvice, dear, inny time o’ day at all at all for the asking.” And it’s\nnot mesilf ye wud have to be bate in the purliteness; so I made her\na bow that wud ha’ broken yur heart altegither to behould, and thin I\npulled aff me hat with a flourish, and thin I winked at her hard wid\nboth eyes, as much as to say, “True for you, yer a swate little crature,\nMrs. Tracle, me darlint, and I wish I may be drownthed dead in a bog,\nif it’s not mesilf, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, that’ll make a\nhoul bushel o’ love to yur leddyship, in the twinkling o’ the eye of a\nLondonderry purraty.”\n\nAnd it was the nixt mornin’, sure, jist as I was making up me mind\nwhither it wouldn’t be the purlite thing to sind a bit o’ writin’ to the\nwiddy by way of a love-litter, when up com’d the delivery servant wid\nan illigant card, and he tould me that the name on it (for I niver could\nrade the copperplate printin on account of being lift handed) was all\nabout Mounseer, the Count, A Goose, Look--aisy, Maiter-di-dauns, and\nthat the houl of the divilish lingo was the spalpeeny long name of the\nlittle ould furrener Frinchman as lived over the way.\n\nAnd jist wid that in cum’d the little willian himself, and then he made\nme a broth of a bow, and thin he said he had ounly taken the liberty\nof doing me the honor of the giving me a call, and thin he went on to\npalaver at a great rate, and divil the bit did I comprehind what he wud\nbe afther the tilling me at all at all, excipting and saving that he\nsaid “pully wou, woolly wou,” and tould me, among a bushel o’ lies, bad\nluck to him, that he was mad for the love o’ my widdy Misthress Tracle,\nand that my widdy Mrs. Tracle had a puncheon for him.\n\nAt the hearin’ of this, ye may swear, though, I was as mad as a\ngrasshopper, but I remimbered that I was Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,\nBarronitt, and that it wasn’t althegither gentaal to lit the anger git\nthe upper hand o’ the purliteness, so I made light o’ the matter and\nkipt dark, and got quite sociable wid the little chap, and afther a\nwhile what did he do but ask me to go wid him to the widdy’s, saying he\nwud give me the feshionable inthroduction to her leddyship.\n\n“Is it there ye are?” said I thin to mesilf, “and it’s thrue for you,\nPathrick, that ye’re the fortunittest mortal in life. We’ll soon see\nnow whither it’s your swate silf, or whither it’s little Mounseer\nMaiter-di-dauns, that Misthress Tracle is head and ears in the love\nwid.”\n\nWid that we wint aff to the widdy’s, next door, and ye may well say it\nwas an illigant place; so it was. There was a carpet all over the floor,\nand in one corner there was a forty-pinny and a Jew’s harp and the divil\nknows what ilse, and in another corner was a sofy, the beautifullest\nthing in all natur, and sitting on the sofy, sure enough, there was the\nswate little angel, Misthress Tracle.\n\n“The tip o’ the mornin’ to ye,” says I, “Mrs. Tracle,” and thin I made\nsich an illigant obaysance that it wud ha quite althegither bewildered\nthe brain o’ ye.\n\n“Wully woo, pully woo, plump in the mud,” says the little furrenner\nFrinchman, “and sure Mrs. Tracle,” says he, that he did, “isn’t this\ngintleman here jist his reverence Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt,\nand isn’t he althegither and entirely the most particular frind and\nacquaintance that I have in the houl world?”\n\nAnd wid that the widdy, she gits up from the sofy, and makes the swatest\ncurthchy nor iver was seen; and thin down she sits like an angel;\nand thin, by the powers, it was that little spalpeen Mounseer\nMaiter-di-dauns that plumped his silf right down by the right side of\nher. Och hon! I ixpicted the two eyes o’ me wud ha cum’d out of my head\non the spot, I was so dispirate mad! Howiver, “Bait who!” says I, after\nawhile. “Is it there ye are, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns?” and so down I\nplumped on the lift side of her leddyship, to be aven with the willain.\nBotheration! it wud ha done your heart good to percave the illigant\ndouble wink that I gived her jist thin right in the face with both eyes.\n\nBut the little ould Frinchman he niver beginned to suspict me at all\nat all, and disperate hard it was he made the love to her leddyship.\n“Woully wou,” says he, “Pully wou,” says he, “Plump in the mud,” says he.\n\n“That’s all to no use, Mounseer Frog, mavourneen,” thinks I; and I\ntalked as hard and as fast as I could all the while, and throth it was\nmesilf jist that divarted her leddyship complately and intirely, by\nrason of the illigant conversation that I kipt up wid her all about the\ndear bogs of Connaught. And by and by she gived me such a swate smile,\nfrom one ind of her mouth to the ither, that it made me as bould as a\npig, and I jist took hould of the ind of her little finger in the most\ndillikitest manner in natur, looking at her all the while out o’ the\nwhites of my eyes.\n\nAnd then ounly percave the cuteness of the swate angel, for no sooner\ndid she obsarve that I was afther the squazing of her flipper, than she\nup wid it in a jiffy, and put it away behind her back, jist as much as\nto say, “Now thin, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, there’s a bitther chance\nfor ye, mavourneen, for it’s not altogether the gentaal thing to be\nafther the squazing of my flipper right full in the sight of that little\nfurrenner Frinchman, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns.”\n\nWid that I giv’d her a big wink jist to say, “lit Sir Pathrick alone for\nthe likes o’ them thricks,” and thin I wint aisy to work, and you’d have\ndied wid the divarsion to behould how cliverly I slipped my right arm\nbetwane the back o’ the sofy, and the back of her leddyship, and there,\nsure enough, I found a swate little flipper all a waiting to say, “the\ntip o’ the mornin’ to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt.” And\nwasn’t it mesilf, sure, that jist giv’d it the laste little bit of a\nsquaze in the world, all in the way of a commincement, and not to be too\nrough wid her leddyship? and och, botheration, wasn’t it the gentaalest\nand dilikittest of all the little squazes that I got in return? “Blood\nand thunder, Sir Pathrick, mavourneen,” thinks I to mesilf, “fait it’s\njist the mother’s son of you, and nobody else at all at all, that’s the\nhandsomest and the fortunittest young bog-throtter that ever cum’d out\nof Connaught!” And with that I givd the flipper a big squaze, and a big\nsquaze it was, by the powers, that her leddyship giv’d to me back. But\nit would ha split the seven sides of you wid the laffin’ to\nbehould, jist then all at once, the consated behavior of Mounseer\nMaiter-di-dauns. The likes o’ sich a jabbering, and a smirking, and a\nparley-wouing as he begin’d wid her leddyship, niver was known before\nupon arth; and divil may burn me if it wasn’t me own very two peepers\nthat cotch’d him tipping her the wink out of one eye. Och, hon! if it\nwasn’t mesilf thin that was mad as a Kilkenny cat I shud like to be\ntould who it was!\n\n“Let me infarm you, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns,” said I, as purlite as\niver ye seed, “that it’s not the gintaal thing at all at all, and not\nfor the likes o’ you inny how, to be afther the oggling and a goggling\nat her leddyship in that fashion,” and jist wid that such another squaze\nas it was I giv’d her flipper, all as much as to say, “isn’t it Sir\nPathrick now, my jewel, that’ll be able to the proticting o’ you, my\ndarlint?” and then there cum’d another squaze back, all by way of the\nanswer. “Thrue for you, Sir Pathrick,” it said as plain as iver a squaze\nsaid in the world, “Thrue for you, Sir Pathrick, mavourneen, and it’s\na proper nate gintleman ye are--that’s God’s truth,” and with that she\nopened her two beautiful peepers till I belaved they wud ha’ cum’d out\nof her hid althegither and intirely, and she looked first as mad as a\ncat at Mounseer Frog, and thin as smiling as all out o’ doors at mesilf.\n\n“Thin,” says he, the willian, “Och hon! and a wolly-wou, pully-wou,” and\nthen wid that he shoved up his two shoulders till the divil the bit of\nhis hid was to be diskivered, and then he let down the two corners of\nhis purraty-trap, and thin not a haporth more of the satisfaction could\nI git out o’ the spalpeen.\n\nBelave me, my jewel, it was Sir Pathrick that was unreasonable mad thin,\nand the more by token that the Frinchman kipt an wid his winking at the\nwiddy; and the widdy she kept an wid the squazing of my flipper, as much\nas to say, “At him again, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, mavourneen:” so I\njust ripped out wid a big oath, and says I;\n\n“Ye little spalpeeny frog of a bog-throtting son of a bloody noun!”--and\njist thin what d’ye think it was that her leddyship did? Troth she\njumped up from the sofy as if she was bit, and made off through\nthe door, while I turned my head round afther her, in a complate\nbewilderment and botheration, and followed her wid me two peepers. You\npercave I had a reason of my own for knowing that she couldn’t git down\nthe stares althegither and intirely; for I knew very well that I had\nhould of her hand, for the divil the bit had I iver lit it go. And says\nI; “Isn’t it the laste little bit of a mistake in the world that ye’ve\nbeen afther the making, yer leddyship? Come back now, that’s a darlint,\nand I’ll give ye yur flipper.” But aff she wint down the stairs like a\nshot, and thin I turned round to the little Frinch furrenner. Och hon!\nif it wasn’t his spalpeeny little paw that I had hould of in my own--why\nthin--thin it wasn’t--that’s all.\n\nAnd maybe it wasn’t mesilf that jist died then outright wid the laffin’,\nto behold the little chap when he found out that it wasn’t the widdy at\nall at all that he had had hould of all the time, but only Sir Pathrick\nO’Grandison. The ould divil himself niver behild sich a long face as he\npet an! As for Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, it wasn’t for\nthe likes of his riverence to be afther the minding of a thrifle of a\nmistake. Ye may jist say, though (for it’s God’s thruth), that afore I\nleft hould of the flipper of the spalpeen (which was not till afther her\nleddyship’s futman had kicked us both down the stairs), I giv’d it such a\nnate little broth of a squaze as made it all up into raspberry jam.\n\n“Woully wou,” says he, “pully wou,” says he--“Cot tam!”\n\nAnd that’s jist the thruth of the rason why he wears his lift hand in a\nsling.\n\n","\nI've never been a fan of Mother's Day or Father's Day. Everyone knows they are just a scam for the Greeting Card companies to make money. Yet my mother always thrusts guilt upon me if I don't get her a card and a nice little present to go with it. I know, I sound like a rotten son for saying it, but I get the card and the gifts solely that I do not feel the 'guilt' that goes otherwise. You see me and my parents do not see eye to eye on many issues, our indifferences causing a huge rift in our relationship with each other. One of many such indifferences which led me to experiencing the trip report I am writing about now. Don't get me wrong, I do love my parents dearly, but sometimes their overbearing love for me becomes a bit too much, and a little bit of escapism is needed. This was one of those nights, escapism inside the Mini Noodle.\n\nI won't go into much detail of what set off our usual bickering, basically it was at a family reunion in which I was accused of not spending enough time with the relatives. I tried defending myself, Mom got a little too worked up about it and brought up other degrading insults into the mix. I grew silent and endured the heated drive back home, where upon returning, I swiftly left in my car to get away. I went to a friend's place where a few of my buddies were lounging, smoking weed and drinking Coronas.\n\nThe laid back environment calmed me down significantly, and soon I forgot all about that afternoon, smoking a few bowls and watching a movie on Satellite t.v. My friends were good company, but unfortunately I am the only night owl in the group. I was able to keep my friends conscious until about 2 am, when they all agreed it was late and parted ways.\n\nI was still unwilling to go back home just yet, so I searched for another thing to do. I then remembered my connect and good friend 'T,' would be off work around 3:30. If I could just kill time until then, I could meet up with him and then sample some more of his latest supply inside the Mini Noodle.\n\nThe Mini Noodle was my sanctuary, a place to kick back and forget about the real world when the going got tough. It simply was an old shed placed out in my friend's backyard which was retrofitted with couches, blacklights and a cheap stereo. It was designed to resemble a chillout room from a rave where me and my friends could unwind and do our drugs. We could get fairly noisy out there and the neighbors wouldn't complain. My friend's neighbors had their own reasons for not wanting to attract the cops. Besides, it wasn't like we were out there every night anyway.\n\nThe chillroom was built so that we could throw a couple of our own mini-raves at the residence, but for the most part, it was still just a shed that held couches and some various paraphanelia, as well as some tagged glow in the dark paint on the walls. It got its name, the 'Mini Noodle,' through the rave venue where I had first met my friends. The Noodle Factory it was called, nestled around a few ghetto parts of West Oakland.\n\nI remembered helping my friends paint the shed when it was getting its new look, and the paint job resembled part of one of the rooms inside the Noodle Factory, which happened to be as cramped and hot as the shed we were painting. One of us pointed this fact out, and we lovingly christened its name, ironically, through our displeasure of partying at the stuffy Noodle Factory. I loved the Mini Noodle, it was my home away from home. Even when the mini-raves stopped happening, I would usually be out there at least once a weekend, smoking a bowl, huffing nitrous, listening to some music or popping a pill. I put that place to good use, and intended to do so again tonight.\n\nI managed spending the next hour and a half driving around aimlessly through town, getting food to eat and loitering outside a few places. I found my friend T outside the Sports Bar he worked at, picked him up and headed to my other friend's place that housed the Mini Noodle. He was my friend's brother, and was living with him at the time, so he was basically getting a free ride home. I asked if he had anymore of the stuff in his possession. He said yes. I smiled. Now for most people, unwinding with a smoke and a few beers would be enough. For me, I felt a little change was in order. I needed something new on the menu, and this time, Ecstacy and Ketamine were the special combo of the day.\n\nI still had a green music note leftover from a party two months ago. I had only done K once, and that was a few days ago when T had given me a free sample after scoring some from a rave he went too last week. It was nothing like I had ever tried before. This time, I wanted to see what K and E could do together. After all, it wasn't like Ketamine was easy to find in this town, so now that it was available, I might as well do some experimenting. T had done that combination before, but wasn't too impressed with it. But he was curious to see what it would do to me. So was I.\n\nI popped the green music note at 4. I normally wouldn't drop so late at night, but these circumstances called for it. I've had an experience with green music notes before. They wouldn't start working til an hour and a half after consumption, the longest I've ever waited for a pill to hit. But once they hit, they worked well, and would leave off some visuals once you came down.\n\nNaturally I wanted to wait an hour and a half before doing a bag of K, so that both drugs would be working in synch. After all, it only takes about 10 minutes for the disassociative effects of K to kick in, and lasts for about an hour. Yes, I had researched the drug fairly well, and timed the duration on my cell phone when I did it a few nights ago. So me and T chilled inside the Mini Noodle, all blacklights turned on, passing the bong back and forth smoking some mediocre weed and talking about parties past.\n\nAt 40 minutes past T could not wait any longer. He pulled out a small red baggie and a cut straw and snorted up the premeasured 100 mg of ketamine hydrochloride inside. He sighed in delight and passed another bag and the straw to me, but I refused. My roll wasn't kicking in yet, I was only stoned and tired, but I was also growing anxious. Just my luck to be left with one pill that took so ridiculously long to hit. T laughed and played some Happy Hardcore. Not my type of music to listen too when taking a disassociative/psychedelic, I much prefer progressive house or psytrance during a trip, but it seemed to make T feel much more at home. I wasn't going to argue this time. I loved happy hardcore when I was rolling anyway, and hopefully I will be rolling soon.\n\n50 minutes past and still nothing but baked thoughts and a slight urge to dance. I had still been talking to T about various things, but the last question he answered, he seemed to get stuck, and stared at me for a few minutes before laughing. I could tell the K was getting hold of him, and I wanted to stay somewhere around his level. So when he offered me the bag and straw the second time around, I took it willingly.\n\nI emptied the bag at 4:50 with just a few strong whiffs, feeling like a disco stud. K goes up the nostrils so much smoother than cocaine. There's no numbness, no breathing out of only one nostril, just a slight tingle to it and it's gone. I poked my finger in the bag, gathered a few more particles and rubbed it on my gums. There was no significance to it, I was only being silly. It got a few more disjointed laughs from T.\n\n5 minutes later he gets up, and wobbles over to the couch to lie down. I say wobble, because walking becomes difficult once K works its magic. It's much better to lie down anyway, because having to stand can become quite distracting from the trip. At 5 am I found myself getting stuck as well. Basically it's just looking around the room and having my vision stop at one random place for a few minutes before I realize I've been staring at nothing for...how long? It becomes difficult telling time too. I could now feel the room slowly start to tilt from side to side, as if a giant was outside the Mini Noodle, rocking the place back and forth.\n\nI get up out of my chair and wave my arms in the air, struggling for balance. My spinal cord refuses to snap upright, so I wobble over to my couch, hunchbacked. I glance over to my right and T is already K'ed out, rocking out to the cheesy riffs of the hardcore. I drop on my couch like dead weight, rocking my head back and forth, becoming amazed at how heavy it feels. And there we lie, on our respective couches, for the next 40 minutes. I check my cellphone here and there to check the time, but soon the LED panel becomes too bright for me to read the display. So I lie there doing nothing, zoning in and out and having scattered thoughts that I forget about a few minutes after.\n\nAt 5:30 T gets up to change cd's with another happy hardcore album. He seems to be fairly sober now, and takes another rip out of the bong once the new cd plays. I'm coming out of my K trip as well, with nothing remarkable to really remember, much to my disappointment. Just as I thought, I had taken the K too early, and now I started to feel my jaw tighten up and the familiar MDMA-induced feelings tingle around my mind and body. Life can be so cruel sometimes, or can it? I turn to look at T with a slight smirk on my face, and ask him, 'Want to go halves on another bag?' T never hesitated.\n\n5:35 am, me and T take in another 50 mg (roughly) of our beloved substance. Neither one of us had fully comedown off the first bump yet, so there would still be some K running in our system as the 2nd bump came in. Before I lose my ability to walk again, I cache out what was left in the bong then promptly return to my seat. The E was coming on quite nicely, but the jaw clench was slightly distracting. If only I had some gum to chew. There was a half-full bottle of Aquafina on the table, so I drink some of that to keep myself hydrated.\n\n10 minutes later I'm wobbling back over to the couch Notre Dame style, this time noticing a difference in the intensity of the influence. My body had become dead weight again, but this time I had much more feeling. I could feel the individual hairs on my arms nestle around, and the itchy fabric of the couch had become softer, I could now feel all the different fibers rest around my skin. How strange it was, to feel all your muscles in your body become 10 times heavier, and yet have elevated feelings in touch.\n\n20 minutes after the 2nd K bump go by, and I can feel my body start to sweat a little. I try pulling my cell phone out to look at the time again, and I see that my phone had bent in an arc to the right. I now had to tilt my head to read the display, and even then my mind couldn't make sense of what it read. It looked familiar, but distant, unimportant. I throw the phone somewhere on the couch and run my fingers through my hair. Oh God, did it feel good, even though my hair felt more like a cheap wig, it still felt good to touch it.\n\nI look up at the ceiling, and all the normal pock marks and scratches are slowly moving forward. It became more like a conveyor belt than a ceiling, as the dents and marks would move forward, then disappear somehow, and come back to its original place, moving forward again. Soon the dents and marks began forming shapes of their own, moving on this upside down conveyor belt. I began to feel like Alice, plummeting down the rabbit hole, and as soon as I thought that, behold! A half visible face of the Cheshire Cat appeared to me, running along the conveyor belt. And as soon as I gasped in surprise, Cheshire grinned at me, before disappearing. Oh my God, it was happening. I was tripping out!\n\nI soon took my focus out of the conveyor belt ceiling, and looked around all the tagged, glow in the dark art covering the walls. It was all mostly neon green, but I saw that the letters were taking on a Life of their own. They were becoming 3-D. They could bend and twist around. They could stretch and shrink. They wanted to move, and this time the natural laws of the Earth couldn't stop them. The dancing letters became pleasant to look at, and I could feel my eyes rolling back in their sockets as the letters darted back and forth across the walls.\n\nThey started moving across the walls and floor so quickly that soon I became convinced that I was stuck inside the Matrix and could see all the green code scrolling by. It was a lightshow like no other, and I was loving it. Here and there I would try to grab one of the letters as they passed by, but my arms would not work right. It kept feeling like they would grow out 20 feet in length, and then I would have a hard time trying to ravel it back to its original length, much like winding up a garden hose. It was too weird of a feeling so I dropped them back on the couch in defeat.\n\nI looked back up at the ceiling to marvel at the Matrix code, but it had disappeared. The letters had gone back to their original places, but they looked foreign, I could still not understand what they read. I saw a little black speck walk across one of the letters, it looked like a small spider. As soon as I thought that, a giant glimmering silver web filled across my vision, and to my surprise, a silky strand of webbing had attached itself on every object in the room, including me. Seeing as I hate spiders, I did what I could to remove the strand of webbing off of myself, as hard as that was to do.\n\nAs soon as it left me, I felt a cold shock run through my body, as if I had been cut off from something vital. I began wondering if perhaps that what I saw was the Web of Life, and everything alive was attached to it, and to be cut off from it could only mean death. No that doesn't make sense. I am tripping, that is all. The air condensed all around me. The light bounced off the air in strange ways, making the air appear solid. What kind of solid reflects light in that way? Glass. Oh no, the air has turned into glass! I am suffocating! I could no longer breathe. All I could feel were sharp pieces of glass ripping into my lungs.\n\nHow could this have happened? There is no glass, you are tripping. Somehow, as chemically altered as my senses were, there was still this tiny, sane voice in my mind, reminding me of what I had taken. As soon as I remembered that I had taken K, the air became normal again. But as poor as my short term memory was that night, I would forget the voice, and start seeing things again.\n\nThe happy hardcore still playing in the background now sounded like it was slowed down, like it had become trance instead. The layers of sound in the tracks were no longer in synch, and so parts of the song would sound off. One lyric sprung into my mind, 'Jump onto your feet,' That sounded like a good idea. But how did one, jump onto their feet? That required movement of some sort right? Movement that I could no longer make. I still wanted to dance to the music, but I couldn't figure how to go about that anymore. Perhaps, if gravity offered a little assistance.\n\nAnd that's when the world tilted. I felt suddenly as if the couch had attached its bottom end onto the left wall and there was all this gravity that was now pushing on my left side, wanting me to fall on the floor, and yet somehow there I remained, glued onto the couch which was now glued onto the wall. And from there, fabrics began appearing everywhere. Various multi-patterned fabrics, as if they had been ripped from some larger material and were now being draped and layered together in random places.\n\nSoon the fabrics were everywhere, polka dots, stripes, labrynth shapes, and others in various degrees of opacity, forming a huge fabric montage in front of my very eyes. I didn't know what the Hell was going on anymore. And when it looked like I would now be suffocated from pounds of fabrics thrown on my body, everything went back to normal. The couch was back on the floor, the glow in the dark art was understandable once again, everything was back in its place. I must have blacked out.\n\nThe hardcore cd had ended and T seemed to have fallen asleep. I still felt very much cracked out and tired, and my jaw ached. I searched around the couch and find my phone. The display read 7:14 am. Wow, it was already morning. I was too tired to drive home, and too cracked out to sleep, so I laid there on the couch, for another hour, thinking of the things I had just experienced. Gradually I'm able to sleep again.\n\nAfter that night I decided to stay away from the Special K for a little while. I had read about its psychedelic effects, and after trying acid and shrooms, I knew I wanted to give this drug a shot. It did not disappoint, it was so radically different from the other psychedelics, it still amazes me to recall the things I saw inside the Mini Noodle that night. Not that I could discern any enlightenment from it, but an interesting experience nonetheless. Just one of many late nights, in the Mini Noodle. Oh yes, and I did get around to giving my mom her gift and card for Mother's Day. Business as usual. \n\n","\nAlthough I had experimented with my share of hallucinogenic drugs, including 10x Salvia and Mushrooms, I had no idea what LSD had in store for me. It would turn out to be my first, and last time using LSD.\n\nMe and a very close friend were on our way back to his house to basically trip for the night. He had scored a bunch of LSD and some particularly potent marijuana which he called AK-47. The night was starting off good. I was a little hesitant to take the acid, just because I'm always reluctant to try new drugs, but my friend convinced me that everything would be ok. I wanted to believe him at that point in time. I looked at the tiny tab of acid and thought, 'How could something so small be harmful?' We casually popped the acid in our mouths and happily drove down the highway, blasting Blur and Radiohead, ready for the night ahead of us.\n\nEventually we got back to his house, and invited over another friend of ours, and lay back waiting to be hit by the acid. I remember the feeling well, it was reminiscent of that feeling you get before you go on-stage to perform, or before you're walking up to give a speech in class. Something close to nervousness, but almost like it wasn't provoked by anything. I remember watching a couple music videos my friend had on tape, and beginning to notice that things were changing. Not visually, just the way I felt about things.\n\nOur friend eventually arrived and by this time, it had been about an hour since we'd taken the acid, and I wasn't seeing visuals, so we decided to smoke the pot and take one more hit a piece. After we stepped back in from smoking the weed, I felt so much better, ready to let the acid 'in'. We took one more hit of it, and sat back and relaxed. Our other friend had work the next day, so she only smoked the weed.\n\nThen the strangest thing happened. I had always thought of acid as being a 'visual' drug, or at least, that's what people talk about. Seeing stuff, tripping. But that was only an added bonus. The feelings I had within my body were the most profound I've ever felt. It was like love was inside me, or at least the idea of it, and I could taste it in my mouth and hear it in my ears. I sat on the couch smiling ear to ear as we watched T.V., thinking, 'This is the most amazing feeling of my entire life.'\n\nThe world then began to change. Pictures on the wall began to re-organize their order, or grow, or shrink. I laughed hysterically at them. I got up to go grab some cheese crackers, but never made it to the cupboard. I was too busy staring at the coat rack, watching it 'breathe'.\n\nThen my entire view of the world changed. Everything made sense. I thought about my life, people I'd dated, mistakes I'd made, but they all seemed to have a purpose. Nothing I had ever done had been in vain, everything for a reason.\n\nMy friend was enjoying his trip too. He came running into the living room with a magazine, screaming that it was telling him secrets. I opened the magazine, only to find the ad he was talking about: A black insert with the Sopranos banner on it. Upon opening it, you'd hear the theme from the show, the Sopranos. I laughed kind of hard at him, but he just smiled right back, and we fell over laughing on the floor together. Our other friend had gone home by now.\n\nWe were having such a wonderful time, we thought we should try and write some music while under the influence. So I grabbed my guitar, and tinkered with the effects processor we had for a bit, then lay back and started to play. I have never, ever, played or heard such beautiful music in my life. It was perfect. I've thought songs were catchy, or really good, or awesome before, but this was like hearing the most perfect noise one could ever hope to listen to. There was no need to ever write another song again after this one. Thankfully, we recorded it onto a little tape player we had lying around, and put it in the tape player and listened to it back.\n\nAll the love and beauty of the entire world seemed to swell within those notes. It relaxed us, but energized us at the same time. We lay for hours listening to that tape in tears at how pretty the music was.\n\n**********\n\nOur trip had been wonderful up to that point. I thought to myself, 'This is the greatest drug of all time, I'm going to do this all the time.'\n\nRight about the time I started thinking that, things started going wrong. We were coming down off the acid, and it was a HARD come down. I lay in the living room sprawled out on the couch trying to sleep, as it was nearly 8:00 AM and we'd been tripping for a solid 10 hours. The dizzyness and 'boat rocking' feeling wouldn't go away. I began to hyperventilate from fear. I had to go home to my house and talk to my mother in a couple hours. What was I going to do?\n\nEvery breath was like my last. I'd hold it in as long as I could, and if I tried to stop thinking about my breathing, I'd stop breathing. I was trying to watch the movie we had put in to get our minds off of it, but it just made me more dizzy. Pretty soon I started complaining that I wasn't coming down the right way. My friend said that I would be ok, just give it time, and that if I felt like sleeping, it would be a good idea.\n\nI Desperately tried to fall asleep for at least 2 hours, but every time I'd seemingly slip off, I'd be awakened by the feeling of electricity jolting through my body. I figured it must have been my breathing getting worse. Eventually we got up, although neither of us had slept, and I had my friend drive me home because I was so dizzy. I remember asking him when the effects would wear off, and he said 'As soon as you get a good night's sleep, you'll be ok again.' So that's what I looked forward too.\n\nWhen I went home, I ran upstairs and got into bed, telling my mom I had been out late last night and needed to sleep all day. Thank god it was a Saturday. She knew something was wrong, but didn't say anything, so I thought I had gotten off scott free. I slept a little that day, and a little that night, but all along, the feelings of dizzyness and color changes and trails never went away. They didn't seem to be getting better anyway.\n\nI sort of lived my life for about a week before I had had enough of it. I wasn't coming down, it was painfully clear to me now. I was having horrible nightmares at night, feelings of not having a soul or not being human. Whenever I'd be out away from the house I'd feel like I was an alien from another world. The world seemed to be totally different, although it looked the same. It frightened me like nothing else ever has.\n\nEventually I broke down and told my mom what I had done. She was understandably upset. Up to this point, she had no idea I even smoked cigarettes, much less smoked pot or did acid. But she was great. She said, 'You're in trouble, but not until you're O.k.' So we immediately hopped on the net to try and find out what was wrong with me. We fould all kinds of speculation, but nothing that particularly diagnosed what was going on.\n\nMy mom said to try and wait it out to see if it was going to go away. About 3 weeks passed. The symptoms had gotten a lot better, but were still there, so I decided to go to a Psychologist. After discussing many things with him, he came to diagnose me as having Post-Hallucinogenic Cognitive Dysfunction. I think it can also be referred to as HPPD. It was like a horrible nightmare hearing him say those words to me. Thoughtout my life there has been one saving grace to all my mishaps, and that has been the thought that no matter what happens, I still have my wits/health about me and I can try and save myself. Now this comfort was gone. I felt as though I had lost my mind, or at least a very precious piece of it. The doctor assured me that it would eventually go away, but it might take a while.\n\nIt's been about 2 months since I took the acid. Although it was the most spectacular drug I've ever taken, with it came HPPD. And I only took it once. This experience has changed my life completely. However, I'm recovering bit by bit every day, and I have a new perspective on life. I no longer use drugs, drink, or even smoke. My grades have risen a lot and I've started going back to church. I'd consider my life to be much better, but at a steep price: a small part of my precious sanity.\n\nOn a side note, the tape that me and my friend recorded that night of ourselves playing music still exists, and I listen to it quite frequently. It's still the most beautiful sounding noise I've ever heard.\n\n","“_CON tal que las costumbres de un autor_,” says Don Thomas de las\nTorres, in the preface to his “Amatory Poems” _“sean puras y castas,\nimporto muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras”_--meaning,\nin plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure\npersonally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We\npresume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would\nbe a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him\nthere until his “Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely\nupon the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a\nmoral; and, what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered\nthat every fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a\ncommentary upon the “Batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s\nobject was to excite a distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going\na step farther, shows that the intention was to recommend to young\nmen temperance in eating and drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has\nsatisfied himself that, by Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin;\nby Antinous, Martin Luther; by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general;\nand, by the Harpies, the Dutch. Our more modern Scholiasts are\nequally acute. These fellows demonstrate a hidden meaning in “The\nAntediluvians,” a parable in Powhatan, “new views in Cock Robin,” and\ntranscendentalism in “Hop O’ My Thumb.” In short, it has been shown that\nno man can sit down to write without a very profound design. Thus to\nauthors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for example,\nneed have no care of his moral. It is there--that is to say, it is\nsomewhere--and the moral and the critics can take care of themselves.\nWhen the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended, and all\nthat he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “Dial,” or the\n“Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended, and\nthe rest that he clearly meant to intend:--so that it will all come very\nstraight in the end.\n\nThere is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by\ncertain ignoramuses--that I have never written a moral tale, or, in more\nprecise words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics predestined\nto bring me out, and develop my morals:--that is the secret. By and by\nthe “North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them ashamed of their\nstupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution--by way\nof mitigating the accusations against me--I offer the sad history\nappended,--a history about whose obvious moral there can be no question\nwhatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals which form\nthe title of the tale. I should have credit for this arrangement--a\nfar wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who reserve the\nimpression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus sneak it in at\nthe fag end of their fables.\n\nDefuncti injuria ne afficiantur was a law of the twelve tables, and De\nmortuis nil nisi bonum is an excellent injunction--even if the dead in\nquestion be nothing but dead small beer. It is not my design, therefore,\nto vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad dog, it is\ntrue, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was not to\nblame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his mother.\nShe did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant--for duties\nto her well--regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies, like\ntough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the better\nfor beating--but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be left-handed,\nand a child flogged left-handedly had better be left unflogged. The\nworld revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a baby from\nleft to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an evil\npropensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks\nits quota of wickedness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements,\nand, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was\ngetting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in\nmy eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when\nhe had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might\nhave mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced\nbeyond that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand\nit no longer, but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my\nvoice, made prophecy of his ruin.\n\nThe fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age\nhe used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At\nsix months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he\nwas in the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies.\nAt eight months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the\nTemperance pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after\nmonth, until, at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon\nwearing moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and\nswearing, and for backing his assertions by bets.\n\nThrough this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had\npredicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown\nwith his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when\nhe came to be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without\ninterlarding it with a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid\nwagers--no. I will do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon\nhave laid eggs. With him the thing was a mere formula--nothing more. His\nexpressions on this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They\nwere simple if not altogether innocent expletives--imaginative phrases\nwherewith to round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you so and\nso,” nobody ever thought of taking him up; but still I could not help\nthinking it my duty to put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and\nso I told him. It was a vulgar one--this I begged him to believe. It was\ndiscountenanced by society--here I said nothing but the truth. It was\nforbidden by act of Congress--here I had not the slightest intention\nof telling a lie. I remonstrated--but to no purpose. I demonstrated--in\nvain. I entreated--he smiled. I implored--he laughed. I preached--he\nsneered. I threatened--he swore. I kicked him--he called for the police.\nI pulled his nose--he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil his head\nthat I would not venture to try that experiment again.\n\nPoverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of\nDammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and\nthis was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about\nbetting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that\nI ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “I’ll bet you a\ndollar.” It was usually “I’ll bet you what you please,” or “I’ll bet you\nwhat you dare,” or “I’ll bet you a trifle,” or else, more significantly\nstill, “I’ll bet the Devil my head.”\n\nThis latter form seemed to please him best;--perhaps because it involved\nthe least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious. Had any\none taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have been\nsmall too. But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure\nthat I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the phrase in\nquestion grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of\na man betting his brains like bank-notes:--but this was a point which my\nfriend’s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend.\nIn the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up\nto “I’ll bet the Devil my head,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness\nof devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. I am always\ndispleased by circumstances for which I cannot account. Mysteries\nforce a man to think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there was\nsomething in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to\nhis offensive expression--something in his manner of enunciation--which\nat first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy--something\nwhich, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted\nto call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical,\nMr. Kant pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson\nhyperquizzitistical. I began not to like it at all. Mr. Dammits soul was\nin a perilous state. I resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to\nsave it. I vowed to serve him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is\nsaid to have served the toad,--that is to say, “awaken him to a sense\nof his situation.” I addressed myself to the task forthwith. Once more I\nbetook myself to remonstrance. Again I collected my energies for a final\nattempt at expostulation.\n\nWhen I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit indulged himself in\nsome very equivocal behavior. For some moments he remained silent,\nmerely looking me inquisitively in the face. But presently he threw his\nhead to one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent. Then he\nspread out the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he\nwinked with the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left.\nThen he shut them both up very tight. Then he opened them both so\nvery wide that I became seriously alarmed for the consequences.\nThen, applying his thumb to his nose, he thought proper to make an\nindescribable movement with the rest of his fingers. Finally, setting\nhis arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.\n\nI can call to mind only the beads of his discourse. He would be obliged\nto me if I would hold my tongue. He wished none of my advice. He\ndespised all my insinuations. He was old enough to take care of himself.\nDid I still think him baby Dammit? Did I mean to say any thing against\nhis character? Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool? Was my maternal\nparent aware, in a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence?\nHe would put this latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and\nhe would bind himself to abide by my reply. Once more he would demand\nexplicitly if my mother knew that I was out. My confusion, he said,\nbetrayed me, and he would be willing to bet the Devil his head that she\ndid not.\n\nMr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he\nleft my presence with undignified precipitation. It was well for him\nthat he did so. My feelings had been wounded. Even my anger had been\naroused. For once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. I\nwould have won for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit’s little head--for the fact\nis, my mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from\nhome.\n\nBut Khoda shefa midêhed--Heaven gives relief--as the Mussulmans say when\nyou tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I had\nbeen insulted, and I bore the insult like a man. It now seemed to me,\nhowever, that I had done all that could be required of me, in the case\nof this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no longer\nwith my counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. But\nalthough I forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself\nto give up his society altogether. I even went so far as to humor some\nof his less reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I\nfound myself lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with\ntears in my eyes:--so profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.\n\nOne fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led\nus in the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to\ncross it. It was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and\nthe archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark.\nAs we entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and\nthe interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those\nof the unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was\nhipped. He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively\nlively--so much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy\nsuspicion. It is not impossible that he was affected with the\ntranscendentals. I am not well enough versed, however, in the diagnosis\nof this disease to speak with decision upon the point; and unhappily\nthere were none of my friends of the “Dial” present. I suggest the idea,\nnevertheless, because of a certain species of austere Merry-Andrewism\nwhich seemed to beset my poor friend, and caused him to make quite a\nTom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve him but wriggling and skipping\nabout under and over every thing that came in his way; now shouting\nout, and now lisping out, all manner of odd little and big words, yet\npreserving the gravest face in the world all the time. I really could\nnot make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him. At length, having\npassed nearly across the bridge, we approached the termination of the\nfootway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile of some height.\nThrough this I made my way quietly, pushing it around as usual. But this\nturn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit. He insisted upon leaping\nthe stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the air. Now\nthis, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The best\npigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and as\nI knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done\nby Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a\nbraggadocio, and could not do what he said. For this I had reason to be\nsorry afterward;--for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his head\nthat he could.\n\nI was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some\nremonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a\nslight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ahem!” I\nstarted, and looked about me in surprise. My glance at length fell into\na nook of the frame--work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a little\nlame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing could be more reverend\nthan his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of black,\nbut his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly down\nover a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a girl’s.\nHis hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and his two\neyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.\n\nUpon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk\napron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very\nodd. Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a\ncircumstance, he interrupted me with a second “ahem!”\n\nTo this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply. The fact\nis, remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. I have known\na Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word “Fudge!” I am not ashamed to\nsay, therefore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance.\n\n“Dammit,” said I, “what are you about? don’t you hear?--the gentleman\nsays ‘ahem!’” I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him;\nfor, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is\nparticularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he\nis pretty sure to look like a fool.\n\n“Dammit,” observed I--although this sounded very much like an oath, than\nwhich nothing was further from my thoughts--“Dammit,” I suggested--“the\ngentleman says ‘ahem!’”\n\nI do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did\nnot think it profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our\nspeeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own\neyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb,\nor knocked him in the head with the “Poets and Poetry of America,” he\ncould hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with\nthose simple words: “Dammit, what are you about?--don’t you hear?--the\ngentleman says ‘ahem!’”\n\n“You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning more colors than\na pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. “Are\nyou quite sure he said that? Well, at all events I am in for it now, and\nmay as well put a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then--ahem!”\n\nAt this the little old gentleman seemed pleased--God only knows why.\nHe left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a\ngracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially,\nlooking all the while straight up in his face with an air of the most\nunadulterated benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to\nimagine.\n\n“I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit,” said he, with the frankest of\nall smiles, “but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake\nof mere form.”\n\n“Ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying\na pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable\nalteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down\nthe corners of his mouth--“ahem!” And “ahem!” said he again, after a\npause; and not another word more than “ahem!” did I ever know him to say\nafter that. “Aha!” thought I, without expressing myself aloud--“this is\nquite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt\na consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. One extreme\ninduces another. I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable\nquestions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave\nhim my last lecture? At all events, he is cured of the transcendentals.”\n\n“Ahem!” here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts,\nand looking like a very old sheep in a revery.\n\nThe old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the\nshade of the bridge--a few paces back from the turnstile. “My good\nfellow,” said he, “I make it a point of conscience to allow you this\nmuch run. Wait here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may\nsee whether you go over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t\nomit any flourishes of the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you know. I will\nsay ‘one, two, three, and away.’ Mind you, start at the word ‘away’”\n Here he took his position by the stile, paused a moment as if in\nprofound reflection, then looked up and, I thought, smiled very\nslightly, then tightened the strings of his apron, then took a long look\nat Dammit, and finally gave the word as agreed upon-\n\n            _One--two--three--and--away!_\n\nPunctually at the word “away,” my poor friend set off in a strong\ngallop. The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord’s--nor yet very low,\nlike that of Mr. Lord’s reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure\nthat he would clear it. And then what if he did not?--ah, that was\nthe question--what if he did not? “What right,” said I, “had the\nold gentleman to make any other gentleman jump? The little old\ndot-and-carry-one! who is he? If he asks me to jump, I won’t do it,\nthat’s flat, and I don’t care who the devil he is.” The bridge, as I\nsay, was arched and covered in, in a very ridiculous manner, and there\nwas a most uncomfortable echo about it at all times--an echo which I\nnever before so particularly observed as when I uttered the four last\nwords of my remark.\n\nBut what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an\ninstant. In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had\ntaken the leap. I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor\nof the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he\nwent up. I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration\njust over the top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually\nsingular thing that he did not continue to go over. But the whole leap\nwas the affair of a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any\nprofound reflections, down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back,\non the same side of the stile from which he had started. At the same\ninstant I saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed,\nhaving caught and wrapt up in his apron something that fell heavily into\nit from the darkness of the arch just over the turnstile. At all this\nI was much astonished; but I had no leisure to think, for Dammit lay\nparticularly still, and I concluded that his feelings had been hurt, and\nthat he stood in need of my assistance. I hurried up to him and found\nthat he had received what might be termed a serious injury. The truth\nis, he had been deprived of his head, which after a close search I could\nnot find anywhere; so I determined to take him home and send for the\nhomoeopathists. In the meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open\nan adjacent window of the bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at\nonce. About five feet just above the top of the turnstile, and crossing\nthe arch of the foot-path so as to constitute a brace, there extended a\nflat iron bar, lying with its breadth horizontally, and forming one of\na series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent.\nWith the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my\nunfortunate friend had come precisely in contact.\n\nHe did not long survive his terrible loss. The homoeopathists did not\ngive him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he\nhesitated to take. So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a\nlesson to all riotous livers. I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked\na bar sinister on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses\nof his funeral, sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists.\nThe scoundrels refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once,\nand sold him for dog’s meat.\n\n","My friend and I's first experience with acid happened May 12 of 2006. We had just gotten out of school so we figured hey, lets get some acid. We'd both done shrooms a couple of times before but that was it for hallucinogens.\n\n7:30AM - we had only gotten a couple of hours of sleep the night before (anticipation) and decided we'd go to the local waffle house for a nice breakfast of Acid and water :) We put the fat blue-stained tabs on our tongues on the way and got our semi-retarded but sober friend to drive us there. Our first indications of anything different were probably about an hour after the drop at the waffle house. With the tabs still on our tongues, we decided to swallow them with water at our table. My friend looked down at a spoon that was next to me and said 'Oh fuck' because my face was starting to 'transform'. I didn't notice any change until we got up to leave, when suddenly I felt really unnaturally tall. The ground was kind of slanted and colors took on a brighter, more vivid effect.\n\nThen it happened. As we got into the car, we went into neverland. All of a sudden it had the effect of a mild mushroom trip and we decided to head for my friend's house because his parents were out. By the time we arrived, it was really starting to hit. Nothing freaked us out at this point even though neither of us had experienced as intense a thing as this before. Once inside, the hallucinations started happening. My first one I'll never forget was lookin at a statue on the mantle and watching it transform into a serpant and slither around. My friend started talkin to the horse head picture on the wall - he said it was pokin out and talking to him. Every aspect of the room seemed to be alive and in its own universe.\n\nOur other friend/sitter decided to go out on the porch and smoke a joint while we continued trippin our balls off. Next stage of the trip, the bathroom. I walked in to take a piss and before I was able to turn on the lights, I had the most intense, realistic hallucinations of people and character's faces coming at me through the darkness. I yelled at my friend to get in there and he saw igniting sparks flying around his head. While our friend was blazing outside we went into the basement to attempt to play pool. HAHAHA. Right. We ended up hunting giraffes on a safari thinkin the pool cue's were spears. Our other sober friend came downstairs and I tried talking to him but I kept seeing things manifest from his face, mainly banana-stalks and images of fruit.\n\nMy trippin friend had left the room to go watch his countertop 'breathe' so I took the opportunity to stick my head into the freezer. Man the images I saw, I can't even describe it. Eventually all 4 of us wound up upstairs and then all hell broke loose. Our beautiful experience was about to turn into a hellish nightmare by the call of one person, my friend's dad. Apparently his dad chose this day of all days to hound his ass on the phone about him not coming home the night before and fully expecting him to be home in a couple of hours. Now we were in trouble - we had planned to stay the entire trip at his house and we had to leave. As if it weren't enough, our friends both bailed on us and so there we were, 2 acid heads outside watching our friends drive away and trying to figure out what to do with poolsticks in our hands.\n\nAfter an eternity of panic (2 real minutes) I called my other friend and told him our situation. We convinced him to drive down and babysit us, so again we were good for about another hour until my friend's dad started calling again. No way could he have talked to him on the phone, we were so far gone from reality at this point that nothing, not even 4 word text messages made sense to us. So began our grand journey. We got our friend to drive us to the local park so we could walk around. We were so fucked up that our only goal was to kill time until we could come down to reality and face society again.\n\nAs soon as we were on the walking/bike path, we noticed our first heavy tracers when bikers would go by and their doubles would keep passing us for another 2 minutes. The jungle had never looked so alive. Everything was moving and breathing, and I think this is where sounds started to mesh with sight and taste. I remember 'tasting' the green of the leaves and hearing the trails of the bikers. Well that lasted about 5 minutes real time (3 hours ours) so we told our friend to drive us anywhere else, which ended up being another park. When we stopped in the parking lot we met another friend who freaked us the fuck out. He kept saying he had a friend who was a sheriff and he was gonna get us arrested and into a drug program.\n\nSo then all of us went to this pizza joint and ordered a large pepperoni. My friend's distorted image of the waitress was beyond ridiculous, he said 'When she put the pizza on the table her face went with it and landed in the middle of the cheese.' By now people's faces were melting and shape-shifting, it was nearly impossible to talk to people, or so we thought, apparently we sounded fine the whole time but we sure as hell didn't feel like we did. There was pizza in front of us and we just couldn't eat - just too fucked up, so its about hour 5 or 6 with no food. Next we, in our brilliancy, decided it would be smart to try to go to a movie just to pass the time. This was the dumbest thing we've ever done. On the way to the theater we happened to see a live car accident as it happened (confirmed by our sober friends), and as if that weren't enough all the times and titles on the theater listings were backwards in real life, which just made us feel more crazier.\n\nBy now we started to get worried that the trip wouldn't end - that's where the panic started. When we walked into the theater, we thought we saw a crowded room with people in every seat, then our friend told us there was only one lady in the very back and suddenly we saw how empty it was. This made us just lose it. The sound meshing of the theater's bass mixed with our howling screams (at the previews) was too much to take. As my friend was busy watching the spindles of light manifest and rotate about the movie screen, I went into the deepest meditative state I've ever been in my life. My eyes were crosseyed and I literally saw what I'd call the spindles of consciousness. Two spinning fibrous greenish tornado beings is the best I can do to describe it. All the while my friend was too freaked out to sit still and started yelling at me in my ear. It sounded like he was a hundred miles away, I could barely hear him I was so far in my own mind. So our sober friend quickly ushered us out and back in the car, 20 dollars wasted on a movie where we didn't even make it past the 3rd preview.\n\nWe went to another friend's house who had just gotten home from school and her parents were gone. We tried hookin up the xbox and playin some halo2, I think I got 26 suicides while seriously trying to play and my friend kept dropping the controller and staring at the ceiling. And then outa nowhere her mom walked in. I can't even tell you the panic. Somehow we talked to her for a few minutes and she left, and then we went outside to the tire swing. This was def. one of the best and scariest parts of the trip. We had our friends wind us up and spin us on the swing, and when we opened our eyes it was like total mind-meltdown, I couldn't even tell you what planet I was on.\n\nSo even longer story short, night came and we were about 14 hours into the trip and still hardcore tripping, I mean tracers and hallucinations, no sign of a comedown. This is what freaked us out the most, everywhere we read had said 12 hours max and we were fucked beyond yesterday. We panicked cause we both were supposed to be home at certain times and we had to get our sober friends to write text messages to our parents telling them we were out for the night. Our best idea at the time was to tell our parents the next day we had been wasted cause anything would be better than them finding out we did acid.\n\n9:45pm and only a small hint of a comedown. our friend said she'd drive us to a local pharmacy and get us some herbal shit. It was supposed to 'detox' us or somethin but we both knew it was bullshit and we couldn't remember how to swallow pills anyway so we stuffed em in our pockets and pretended to take them. When we got back to her house we were way freaking out and decided it was up to us to learn how to 'reintegrate into society'. We tried immitating the other 'humans' aka non-acid-takers we saw in her house by eating muffins and playing cards. That lasted 20 seconds, we were too fucked to tell what our cards were or understand any purpose of the game.\n\n11pm still trippin and we have our original friend from the morning pick us up and take us to his house to crash for the night. In the meantime we had talked to dogs, plotted a genius escape by making our caretakers think we had disappeared and killed each other, and watched the most beautiful sunset you could possibly imagine.\n\nSo back at the house we attempted to go to sleep. 2 in the morning and we knew we were coming down but we still weren't sure when the hell it was all gonna be over. We had told our friend to sleep in the room with us in case his mom would have come down or something but that lazy mullet-haired water-head down syndrom son of a bitch said he wanted to sleep upstairs and that he'd be back in the morning. So after he leaves, we freak out for the last time of the trip and take it upon ourselves to create a 'fake friend' for our comfort lol. We put covers over a bunch of pillows to make it look like someone was asleep on the sofa and for whatever reason it just worked, totally reassured us for the rest of the night.\n\nAbout 4am and we were in and out of sleep, still really restless from almost 20 hours of non-stop tripping and NOTHING to eat all day. The tv was on but anytime we'd see human faces it would just freak us out and remind us how not normal we were, so we put it on the golf channel (and we HATE golf) all night just because there wasn't anything to horrific about watching a ball cross a green. After what seemed to be nine eternities (literally watching the seconds of the clock for hours) we somehow slept for a couple hours and awoke in the morning.\n\nVisuals had returned to normal but the lingering psychosis was still there, we just didn't feel like ourselves. We felt in some way detatched and we didn't think we were ready to go back into society. But we went our separate ways and that was that, followed by the next two days of reintegration. Things and thoughts became normal but it was an agonizingly slow process. The first time I talked to my mom the day after the trip I almost puked I was so nervous, but I sounded fine on the outside.\n\n","Tonight, I come not to speak about the \"State of the Government\", not to detail every new initiative we plan for the coming year, nor describe every line in the budget. I'm here to speak to you and to the American people about the State of the Union about our world, the changes we've seen, the challenges we face. And what that means for America.\nThere are singular moments in history, dates that divide all that goes before from all that comes after. And many of us in this chamber have lived much of our lives in a world whose fundamental features were defined in 1945. And the events of that year decreed the shape of nations, the pace of progress, freedom or oppression for millions of people around the world.\nNineteen Forty-Five provided the common frame of reference the compass points of the postwar era we've relied upon to understand ourselves. And that was our world until now. The events of the year just ended, the Revolution of '89, have been a chain reaction, changes so striking that it marks the beginning of a new era in the world's affairs.\nThink back think back just twelve short months ago to the world we knew as 1989 began.\nOne year, one year ago the people of Panama lived in fear under the thumb of a dictator. Today democracy is restored. Panama is free.\n\"Operation Just Cause\" has achieved its objective. And the number of military personell in Panama is now very close to what it was before the operation began. And tonight I am announcing that before the end of February the additional numbers of American troops, the brave men and women of our armed forces who made this mission a success, will be back home.\nA year ago in Poland, Lech Walesa declared he was ready to open a dialogue with the Communist rulers of that country. And today, with the future of a free Poland in their own hands, members of Solidarity lead the Polish government.\nAnd a year ago, freedom's playwright, Vaclav Havel, languished as a prisoner in Prague. And today it's Vaclav Havel, President of Czechoslovakia.\nAnd one year ago Erich Honecker of East Germany claimed history as his guide. He predicted the Berlin Wall would last another hundred years. And today, less than one year later, it's the wall that's history.\nRemarkable events, remarkable events, events that fulfill the long-held hopes of the American people. Events that validate the longstanding goals of American policy, a policy based upon a single shining principle: the cause of freedom.\nAmerica, not just the nation, but an idea alive in the minds of the people, everywhere. As this new world takes shape, America stands at the center of a widening circle of freedom, today, tomorrow and into the next century.\nOur nation is the enduring dream of every immigrant who ever set foot on these shores, and the millions still struggling to be free. This nation, this idea callled America was and always will be a new world, our new world.\nAt a workers' rally in a place called Branik on the outskirts of Prague the idea called America is alive. A worker, dressed in grimy overalls, rises to speak at the factory gates. And he begins his speech to his fellow citizens with these words, words of a distant revolution: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"\nIt's no secret here at home freedom's door opened long ago. The cornerstones of this free society have already been set in place: democracy, competition, opportunity, private investment, stewardship, and of course, leadership.\nAnd our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours, a system second to none, and make it better:\nA better America where there's a job for whoever wants one;\nWhere women working outside the home can be confident their childeren are in safe and loving care, and where Government works to expand child alternatives for parents. Where we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong economy. Where \"Made in the USA\" is recognized around the world as the symbol of quality and progress, And where every one of us enjoys the same opportunities to live, to work and to contribute to society. And where, for the first time, the American mainstream includes all of our disabled citizens. Where everyone has a roof over his head, and where the homeless get the help they need to live in dignity. Where our schools challenge and support our kids and our teachers, and every one of them makes the grade, Where every street, every city, every school and every child is drug-free. And finally, and finally, where no American is forgotten. Our hearts go out to our hostages, our hostages who are ceaselessly in our minds and in our efforts.\nThat's part of the future we want to see, the future we can make for ourselves. But dreams alone won't get us there. We need to extend our horizon, to commit to the long view. And our mission for the future starts today.\nIn the tough competitive markets around the world, America faces the great challenges and great opportunities. And we know that we can succeed in the global economic arena of the 90's. But to meet that challenge we must make some fundamental changes, some crucial investments in ourselves.\nYes, we are going to invest in America. This Administration is determined to encourage the creation of capital, capital of all kinds. Physical capital: everything from our farms and factories to our workshops and production lines, all that is needed to produce and deliver quality goods and quality services. Intellectual, intellectual capital: the source of ideas that spark tomorrow's products. And of course human capital: the talented work force that we'll need to compete in the global market.\nAnd let me tell you, if we ignore human capital, if we lose the spirit of American ingenuity, the sprit that is the hallmark of the AMERICAN worker, that would be bad. The American worker is the most productive worker in the world.\nWe need to save more. We need to expand the pool of capital for new investments that mean more jobs and more growth. And that's the idea behind the new initiative I call the Family Savings Plan, which I will send to Congress tomorrow.\nWe need to cut the tax on capital gains, encourage, encourage risk-takers, especially those in small businesses, to take those steps that translate into economic reward, jobs, and a better life for all of us.\nWe'll do what it takes to invest in America's future. The budget commitment is there. The money is there. It's there for research and development, R and D, a record high. It's there for our housing initiative, hope, H-O-P-E, to help everyone from first-time homebuyers to the homeless. The money's there to keep our kids drug-free, 70 percent more than when I took office in 1989. It's there for space exploration, and its there for education, another record high.\nAnd one more, and one more thing. Last fall at the education summit, the governors and I agreed to look for ways to help make sure that our kids are ready to learn the very first day they walk into the classroom. And I've made good on that commitment by proposing a record increase in funds, an extra half billion dollars, for something near and dear to all of us: Head Start.\nEducation is the one investment that means more for our future, because it means the most for our children. Real improvement in our schools is not simply a matter of spending more. It's a matter of asking more, expecting more, of our schools, our teachers, of our kids, of our parents and of ourselves. And that's why tonight, and that's why tonight, I am announcing America's education goals, goals developed with enormous cooperation from the nation's governors. And if I might I'd like to say I'm very pleased that Governor Gardner and Governor Clinton, Governor Branstad, Governor Campbell, all of whom were very key in these discussion, these deliberations, are with us here tonight.\nBy the, by the year 2000, every child must start school ready to learn. The United States must increase the high school graduation rate to no less than 90 percent. And we are going to make sure our schools' diplomas mean something. In critical subjects, at the fourth, eighth, and 12th grades, we must assess our students' performance.\nBy the, by the year 2000 U.S. students must be the first in the world in math and science achievement. Every American adult must be a skilled, literate worker and citizen. Every school must offer the kind of disciplined envorionment that makes it possible for our kids to learn. And every school in America must be drug-free.\nAmbitious aims? Of course. Easy to do? Far from it. But the future's at stake. The nation will not accept anything less than excellence in education.\nThese investments will help keep America competitive. And I know this about the American people: we welcome competition. We'll match our ingenuity, our energy, our experience, and technology our spirit and enterprise against anyone. But let the competition be free, but let it also be fair. America is ready.\nSince we really mean it, and since we're serious about being ready to meet our challenge, we're getting our own house in order. We have made real progress. Seven years ago, the Federal deficit was 6 percent of our gross national product, 6 percent. In the new budget I sent up two days ago the deficit is down to 1 percent of GNP.\nThat budget brings Federal spending under control. It meets the Gramm-Rudman target. It brings the deficit down further. And balances the budget by 1993, with no new taxes.\nAnd let me tell you, there's still more than enough Federal spending. For most of us, $1.2 trillion is still a lot of money.\nAnd once the budget is balanced, we can operate the way every family must when it has bills to pay. We won't leave it to our children and grandchildren. Once it's balanced, we will start paying off the national debt.\nAnd there's something more, and there's something more we owe the generations of the future: stewardship, the safekeeping of America's precious environmental inheritance.\nAs just one sign of how serious we are, we will elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet rank. Not, not more bureaucracy, not more red tape, but the certainty that here at home, and especially in our dealings with other nations, environmental issues have the status they deserve.\nThis year's budget provides over $2 billion in new spending to protect our environment, with over $1 billion for global change research, and a new intiative I call America the Beautiful to expand our national parks and wildlife preserves and improve recreational facilities on public lands.\nAnd something else, something that will help keep this country clean, from our forest land to the inner cities, and keep America beautiful for generations to come, the money to plant a billion trees a year.\nAnd tonight, and tonight let me say again to all the members of the Congress, the American people did not send us here to bicker. There is work to do, and they sent us here to get it done. And once again, in the spirit of cooperation I offer my hand to all of you. And let's work together to do the will of the people---clean air, child care, the educational excellence act, crime and drugs. It's time to act. The farm bill, transportation policy, product liability reform, enterprise zones. It's time to act together.\nAnd there's one thing I hope we can agree on. It's about our commitments. And I'm talking about Social Security.\nTo every American out there on Social Security, to every, every American supporting that system today, and to everyone counting on it when they retire, we made a promise to you, and we are going to keep it.\nWe, we rescued the system in 1983 and it's sound again, bipartisan arrangement. Our budget fully funds today's benefits and it asssures that future benefits will be funded as well. And the last thing we need to do is mess around with Social Security.\nThere's one more problem we need to address. We must give careful consideration to the recommendations of the health care studies under way now. And that's why tonight, I am asking Dr. Sullivan, Lou Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, to lead a Domestic Policy Council review of recommendations on the quality, accessibility and cost of our nation's health care system. I am committed to bring the staggering costs of health care under control.\nThe State of the Government does indeed depend on many of us in this very chamber. But the State of the Union depends on all Americans. We must maintain the democratic decency that makes a nation out of millions of individuals. And I've been appalled at the recent mail bombings across this country. Every one of us must confront and condemn racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry and hate. Not next week, not tomorrow, but right now. Every single one of us.\nThe State of the Union depends on whether we help our neighbor, claim the problems of our community as our own. We've got to step forward when there's trouble, lend a hand, be what I call a point of light to a stranger in need. We've got to take the time after a busy day to sit down and read with our kids, help them with their homework, pass along the values we had as children. And that's how we sustain the State of the Union.\nEvery effort is important. It all adds up. It's doing the things that give democracy meaning. It all adds up to who we are and who we will be.\nAnd let me say, that so long as we remember the American idea, so long as we live up to the American ideal, the State of the Union will remain sound and strong.\nAnd to those who worry that we've lost our way, well, I want you to listen to parts of a letter written by James Markwell, Pvt. 1st Class James Markwell, a 20-year-old Army medic to the First Battalion, 75th Rangers. It's dated Dec. 18, the day before our armed forces went into action in Panama. It's a letter servicemen write—and hope will never, ever be sent. And sadly, Private Markwell's mother did receive this letter. She passed it on to me out there in Cincinnati. And here is some of what he wrote: \"I've never been afraid of death, but I know he is waiting at the corner...I've been trained to kill and to save, and so has everyone else. I am frightened of what lays beyond the fog, and yet... do not mourn for me. Revel in the life that I have died to give you... But most of all, don't forget that the Army was my choice. Something that I wanted to do. Remember I joined the Army to serve my country and inure that you are free to do what you want and to live your lives freely.\"\nLet me add that Private Markwell was among the first to see battle in Panama, and among the first to fall. But he knew what he believed in. He carried the idea we call America in his heart.\nI began tonight speaking about the changes we've seen this past year. There is a new world of challenges and opportunities before us. And there is a need for leadership that only America can provide.\nNearly 40 years ago, in his last address to the Congress, President Harry Truman predicted such a time would come. He said, \"As our world grows stronger, more united, more attractive to men on both sides of the Iron Curtain, then inevitably there will come a time of change within the Communist world.\"\nToday, that change is taking place.\nFor more than 40 years, America and its allies held Communism in check and insured that democracy would continue to exist. And today, with Communism crumbling, our aim must be to insure democracy's advance, to take the lead in forging peace and freedom's best hope, a great and growing commonwealth of free nations.\nAnd to the Congres and to all Americans, I say it is time to acclaim a new consensus at home and abroad, a common vision of the peaceful world we want to see.\nHere in our own hemisphere it is time for all the people of the Americas, North and South, to live in freedom.\nIn the Far East and Africa, it's time for the full flowering of free governments and free markets that have served the engine of progress.\nIt is time to offer our hand to the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe so that continent, for too long a continent divided, can see a future whole and free.\nIt's time to build on our new relationship with the Soviet Union, to endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward democracy and economic opportunity.\nWe are in a period of great transition, great hope, and yet great uncertainty. We recognize that the Soviet military threat in Europe is diminishing, but we see little change in Soviet strategic modernization. And, therefore, we must sustain our own strategic offense modernization and the Strategic Defense Initiative.\nBut the time is right to move forward on a conventional arms control agreement to move us to more appropriate levels of military forces in Europe, a coherent defense program that insures the U.S. will continue to be a catalyst for peaceful change in Europe. And I've consulted with leaders of NATO. In fact I spoke by phone with President Gorbachev just today.\nAnd I agree with our European allies that an American military presence in Europe is essential and that it should not be solely tied to the Soviet military presence in Eastern Europe.\nBut our troop levels can still be lower. And so tonight I am announcing a major new step for a further reduction in U.S. and Soviet manpower in Central and Eastern Europe to 195,000 on each side.\nThis number, this number, this level, reflects the advice of our senior military advisers. It's designed to protect American and European interests and sustain NATO's defense strategy. A swift conclusion to our arms control talks—conventional, chemical and strategic--- must now be our goal. And that time has come.\nStill, we must recognize an unfortunate fact: in many regions of the world tonight the reality is conflict, not peace. Enduring animosities and opposing interests remain. And thus the cause of peace must be served by an America strong enough and sure enough to defend our interests and our ideals. It's this American idea that for the past four decades helped inspire the Revolution of '89.\nAnd here at home, and in the world, there is history in the making, and history to be made. Six months ago, early in this season of change, I stood at the gates of the Gdansk shipyard in Poland at the monument to the fallen workers of Solidarity. It's a monument of simple majesty. Three tall crosses rise up from the stones, and atop each cross, an anchor, an ancient symbol of hope.\nThe anchor in our world today is freedom. Holding us steady in times of change, a symbol of hope to all the world. And freedom is at the very heart of the idea that is America. Giving life to the idea depends on every one of us. Our anchor has always been faith and family.\nIn the last few days of this past monumentous year, our family was blessed once more, celebrating the joy of life when a little boy became our 12th grandchild. When I held the little guy fo the first time, the troubles at home and abroad seemed manageable, and totally in perspective.\nAnd now I know, I know you're probably thinking, Well, that's just a grandfather talking.\nWell, maybe you're right. But I've met a lot of children this past year across this country, as all of you have. Everywhere from the Far East to Eastern Europe. All kids are unique. Yet, all kids are alike. The budding young environmentalist I met this month, who joined me in exploring the Florida Everglades. The Little Leaguers I played catch with in Poland, ready to go from Warsaw to the World Series. And even the kids who are ill or alone— and God bless those boarder babies, born addicted to drugs and AIDS — coping with problems no child should have to face. But, you know, when it comes to hope and the future, every kid is the same: full of dreams, ready to take on the world, all special because they are the very future of freedom. And to them belongs this new world I've been speaking about.\nAnd so tonight, I'm going to ask something of every one of you. Now let me start with my generation, with the grandparents out there. You are our living link with the past. Tell your grandchildren the story of struggles waged at home and abroad, of sacrifices freely made for freedom's sake. And tell them your own story as well, because every American has a story to tell.\nAnd parents, your children look to you for direction and guidance. Tell them of faith and family. Tell them we are one nation under God. Teach them that of all the many gifts they can receive, liberty is their most precious legacy. And of all the gifts they can give, the greatest, the greatest is helping others.\nAnd to the children and young people out there tonight, with you rests our hope, all that America will mean in the years and decades ahead. Fix your vision on a new century, your century, on dreams we cannot see, on the destiny that is yours and yours alone.\nAnd finally, let all Americans, all of us here in this chamber, the symbolic center of democracy, affirm our allegience to this idea we call America. And let us remember that the State of the Union depends upon each and every one of us.\nGod bless all of you. And may God bless this great nation, the United States of America\n","“_CON tal que las costumbres de un autor_,” says Don Thomas de las\nTorres, in the preface to his “Amatory Poems” _“sean puras y castas,\nimporto muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras”_--meaning,\nin plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure\npersonally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We\npresume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would\nbe a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him\nthere until his “Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely\nupon the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a\nmoral; and, what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered\nthat every fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a\ncommentary upon the “Batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s\nobject was to excite a distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going\na step farther, shows that the intention was to recommend to young\nmen temperance in eating and drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has\nsatisfied himself that, by Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin;\nby Antinous, Martin Luther; by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general;\nand, by the Harpies, the Dutch. Our more modern Scholiasts are\nequally acute. These fellows demonstrate a hidden meaning in “The\nAntediluvians,” a parable in Powhatan, “new views in Cock Robin,” and\ntranscendentalism in “Hop O’ My Thumb.” In short, it has been shown that\nno man can sit down to write without a very profound design. Thus to\nauthors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for example,\nneed have no care of his moral. It is there--that is to say, it is\nsomewhere--and the moral and the critics can take care of themselves.\nWhen the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended, and all\nthat he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “Dial,” or the\n“Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended, and\nthe rest that he clearly meant to intend:--so that it will all come very\nstraight in the end.\n\nThere is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by\ncertain ignoramuses--that I have never written a moral tale, or, in more\nprecise words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics predestined\nto bring me out, and develop my morals:--that is the secret. By and by\nthe “North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them ashamed of their\nstupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution--by way\nof mitigating the accusations against me--I offer the sad history\nappended,--a history about whose obvious moral there can be no question\nwhatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals which form\nthe title of the tale. I should have credit for this arrangement--a\nfar wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who reserve the\nimpression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus sneak it in at\nthe fag end of their fables.\n\nDefuncti injuria ne afficiantur was a law of the twelve tables, and De\nmortuis nil nisi bonum is an excellent injunction--even if the dead in\nquestion be nothing but dead small beer. It is not my design, therefore,\nto vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad dog, it is\ntrue, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was not to\nblame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his mother.\nShe did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant--for duties\nto her well--regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies, like\ntough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the better\nfor beating--but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be left-handed,\nand a child flogged left-handedly had better be left unflogged. The\nworld revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a baby from\nleft to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an evil\npropensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks\nits quota of wickedness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements,\nand, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was\ngetting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in\nmy eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when\nhe had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might\nhave mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced\nbeyond that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand\nit no longer, but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my\nvoice, made prophecy of his ruin.\n\nThe fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age\nhe used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At\nsix months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he\nwas in the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies.\nAt eight months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the\nTemperance pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after\nmonth, until, at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon\nwearing moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and\nswearing, and for backing his assertions by bets.\n\nThrough this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had\npredicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown\nwith his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when\nhe came to be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without\ninterlarding it with a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid\nwagers--no. I will do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon\nhave laid eggs. With him the thing was a mere formula--nothing more. His\nexpressions on this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They\nwere simple if not altogether innocent expletives--imaginative phrases\nwherewith to round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you so and\nso,” nobody ever thought of taking him up; but still I could not help\nthinking it my duty to put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and\nso I told him. It was a vulgar one--this I begged him to believe. It was\ndiscountenanced by society--here I said nothing but the truth. It was\nforbidden by act of Congress--here I had not the slightest intention\nof telling a lie. I remonstrated--but to no purpose. I demonstrated--in\nvain. I entreated--he smiled. I implored--he laughed. I preached--he\nsneered. I threatened--he swore. I kicked him--he called for the police.\nI pulled his nose--he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil his head\nthat I would not venture to try that experiment again.\n\nPoverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of\nDammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and\nthis was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about\nbetting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that\nI ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “I’ll bet you a\ndollar.” It was usually “I’ll bet you what you please,” or “I’ll bet you\nwhat you dare,” or “I’ll bet you a trifle,” or else, more significantly\nstill, “I’ll bet the Devil my head.”\n\nThis latter form seemed to please him best;--perhaps because it involved\nthe least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious. Had any\none taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have been\nsmall too. But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure\nthat I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the phrase in\nquestion grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of\na man betting his brains like bank-notes:--but this was a point which my\nfriend’s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend.\nIn the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up\nto “I’ll bet the Devil my head,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness\nof devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. I am always\ndispleased by circumstances for which I cannot account. Mysteries\nforce a man to think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there was\nsomething in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to\nhis offensive expression--something in his manner of enunciation--which\nat first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy--something\nwhich, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted\nto call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical,\nMr. Kant pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson\nhyperquizzitistical. I began not to like it at all. Mr. Dammits soul was\nin a perilous state. I resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to\nsave it. I vowed to serve him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is\nsaid to have served the toad,--that is to say, “awaken him to a sense\nof his situation.” I addressed myself to the task forthwith. Once more I\nbetook myself to remonstrance. Again I collected my energies for a final\nattempt at expostulation.\n\nWhen I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit indulged himself in\nsome very equivocal behavior. For some moments he remained silent,\nmerely looking me inquisitively in the face. But presently he threw his\nhead to one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent. Then he\nspread out the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he\nwinked with the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left.\nThen he shut them both up very tight. Then he opened them both so\nvery wide that I became seriously alarmed for the consequences.\nThen, applying his thumb to his nose, he thought proper to make an\nindescribable movement with the rest of his fingers. Finally, setting\nhis arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.\n\nI can call to mind only the beads of his discourse. He would be obliged\nto me if I would hold my tongue. He wished none of my advice. He\ndespised all my insinuations. He was old enough to take care of himself.\nDid I still think him baby Dammit? Did I mean to say any thing against\nhis character? Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool? Was my maternal\nparent aware, in a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence?\nHe would put this latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and\nhe would bind himself to abide by my reply. Once more he would demand\nexplicitly if my mother knew that I was out. My confusion, he said,\nbetrayed me, and he would be willing to bet the Devil his head that she\ndid not.\n\nMr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he\nleft my presence with undignified precipitation. It was well for him\nthat he did so. My feelings had been wounded. Even my anger had been\naroused. For once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. I\nwould have won for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit’s little head--for the fact\nis, my mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from\nhome.\n\nBut Khoda shefa midêhed--Heaven gives relief--as the Mussulmans say when\nyou tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I had\nbeen insulted, and I bore the insult like a man. It now seemed to me,\nhowever, that I had done all that could be required of me, in the case\nof this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no longer\nwith my counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. But\nalthough I forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself\nto give up his society altogether. I even went so far as to humor some\nof his less reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I\nfound myself lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with\ntears in my eyes:--so profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.\n\nOne fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led\nus in the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to\ncross it. It was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and\nthe archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark.\nAs we entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and\nthe interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those\nof the unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was\nhipped. He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively\nlively--so much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy\nsuspicion. It is not impossible that he was affected with the\ntranscendentals. I am not well enough versed, however, in the diagnosis\nof this disease to speak with decision upon the point; and unhappily\nthere were none of my friends of the “Dial” present. I suggest the idea,\nnevertheless, because of a certain species of austere Merry-Andrewism\nwhich seemed to beset my poor friend, and caused him to make quite a\nTom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve him but wriggling and skipping\nabout under and over every thing that came in his way; now shouting\nout, and now lisping out, all manner of odd little and big words, yet\npreserving the gravest face in the world all the time. I really could\nnot make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him. At length, having\npassed nearly across the bridge, we approached the termination of the\nfootway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile of some height.\nThrough this I made my way quietly, pushing it around as usual. But this\nturn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit. He insisted upon leaping\nthe stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the air. Now\nthis, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The best\npigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and as\nI knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done\nby Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a\nbraggadocio, and could not do what he said. For this I had reason to be\nsorry afterward;--for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his head\nthat he could.\n\nI was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some\nremonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a\nslight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ahem!” I\nstarted, and looked about me in surprise. My glance at length fell into\na nook of the frame--work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a little\nlame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing could be more reverend\nthan his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of black,\nbut his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly down\nover a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a girl’s.\nHis hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and his two\neyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.\n\nUpon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk\napron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very\nodd. Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a\ncircumstance, he interrupted me with a second “ahem!”\n\nTo this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply. The fact\nis, remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. I have known\na Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word “Fudge!” I am not ashamed to\nsay, therefore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance.\n\n“Dammit,” said I, “what are you about? don’t you hear?--the gentleman\nsays ‘ahem!’” I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him;\nfor, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is\nparticularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he\nis pretty sure to look like a fool.\n\n“Dammit,” observed I--although this sounded very much like an oath, than\nwhich nothing was further from my thoughts--“Dammit,” I suggested--“the\ngentleman says ‘ahem!’”\n\nI do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did\nnot think it profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our\nspeeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own\neyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb,\nor knocked him in the head with the “Poets and Poetry of America,” he\ncould hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with\nthose simple words: “Dammit, what are you about?--don’t you hear?--the\ngentleman says ‘ahem!’”\n\n“You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning more colors than\na pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. “Are\nyou quite sure he said that? Well, at all events I am in for it now, and\nmay as well put a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then--ahem!”\n\nAt this the little old gentleman seemed pleased--God only knows why.\nHe left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a\ngracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially,\nlooking all the while straight up in his face with an air of the most\nunadulterated benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to\nimagine.\n\n“I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit,” said he, with the frankest of\nall smiles, “but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake\nof mere form.”\n\n“Ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying\na pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable\nalteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down\nthe corners of his mouth--“ahem!” And “ahem!” said he again, after a\npause; and not another word more than “ahem!” did I ever know him to say\nafter that. “Aha!” thought I, without expressing myself aloud--“this is\nquite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt\na consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. One extreme\ninduces another. I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable\nquestions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave\nhim my last lecture? At all events, he is cured of the transcendentals.”\n\n“Ahem!” here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts,\nand looking like a very old sheep in a revery.\n\nThe old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the\nshade of the bridge--a few paces back from the turnstile. “My good\nfellow,” said he, “I make it a point of conscience to allow you this\nmuch run. Wait here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may\nsee whether you go over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t\nomit any flourishes of the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you know. I will\nsay ‘one, two, three, and away.’ Mind you, start at the word ‘away’”\n Here he took his position by the stile, paused a moment as if in\nprofound reflection, then looked up and, I thought, smiled very\nslightly, then tightened the strings of his apron, then took a long look\nat Dammit, and finally gave the word as agreed upon-\n\n            _One--two--three--and--away!_\n\nPunctually at the word “away,” my poor friend set off in a strong\ngallop. The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord’s--nor yet very low,\nlike that of Mr. Lord’s reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure\nthat he would clear it. And then what if he did not?--ah, that was\nthe question--what if he did not? “What right,” said I, “had the\nold gentleman to make any other gentleman jump? The little old\ndot-and-carry-one! who is he? If he asks me to jump, I won’t do it,\nthat’s flat, and I don’t care who the devil he is.” The bridge, as I\nsay, was arched and covered in, in a very ridiculous manner, and there\nwas a most uncomfortable echo about it at all times--an echo which I\nnever before so particularly observed as when I uttered the four last\nwords of my remark.\n\nBut what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an\ninstant. In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had\ntaken the leap. I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor\nof the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he\nwent up. I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration\njust over the top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually\nsingular thing that he did not continue to go over. But the whole leap\nwas the affair of a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any\nprofound reflections, down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back,\non the same side of the stile from which he had started. At the same\ninstant I saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed,\nhaving caught and wrapt up in his apron something that fell heavily into\nit from the darkness of the arch just over the turnstile. At all this\nI was much astonished; but I had no leisure to think, for Dammit lay\nparticularly still, and I concluded that his feelings had been hurt, and\nthat he stood in need of my assistance. I hurried up to him and found\nthat he had received what might be termed a serious injury. The truth\nis, he had been deprived of his head, which after a close search I could\nnot find anywhere; so I determined to take him home and send for the\nhomoeopathists. In the meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open\nan adjacent window of the bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at\nonce. About five feet just above the top of the turnstile, and crossing\nthe arch of the foot-path so as to constitute a brace, there extended a\nflat iron bar, lying with its breadth horizontally, and forming one of\na series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent.\nWith the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my\nunfortunate friend had come precisely in contact.\n\nHe did not long survive his terrible loss. The homoeopathists did not\ngive him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he\nhesitated to take. So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a\nlesson to all riotous livers. I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked\na bar sinister on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses\nof his funeral, sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists.\nThe scoundrels refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once,\nand sold him for dog’s meat.\n\n","I put down more hits than mafioso made\nAnd Lucky Lucianno 'bout to sing soprano\nAnd I know, I know the way you feel\nAnd baby bubba we gon' keep it on tha real\nJust to get you caught up in amazement\nWe puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous\nBut when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack\nAnd let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha\nHow you feelin'?

We\npresume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would\nbe a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him\nthere until his “Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely\nupon the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a\nmoral; and, what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered\nthat every fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a\ncommentary upon the “Batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s\nobject was to excite a distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going\na step farther, shows that the intention was to recommend to young\nmen temperance in eating and drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has\nsatisfied himself that, by Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin;\nby Antinous, Martin Luther; by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general;\nand, by the Harpies, the Dutch. Our more modern Scholiasts are\nequally acute. These fellows demonstrate a hidden meaning in “The\nAntediluvians,” a parable in Powhatan, “new views in Cock Robin,” and\ntranscendentalism in “Hop O’ My Thumb.” In short, it has been shown that\nno man can sit down to write without a very profound design. Thus to\nauthors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for example,\nneed have no care of his moral. It is there--that is to say, it is\nsomewhere--and the moral and the critics can take care of themselves.\nWhen the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended, and all\nthat he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “Dial,” or the\n“Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended, and\nthe rest that he clearly meant to intend:--so that it will all come very\nstraight in the end.\n\nThere is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by\ncertain ignoramuses--that I have never written a moral tale, or, in more\nprecise words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics predestined\nto bring me out, and develop my morals:--that is the secret. By and by\nthe “North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them ashamed of their\nstupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution--by way\nof mitigating the accusations against me--I offer the sad history\nappended,--a history about whose obvious moral there can be no question\nwhatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals which form\nthe title of the tale. I should have credit for this arrangement--a\nfar wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who reserve the\nimpression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus sneak it in at\nthe fag end of their fables.\n\nDefuncti injuria ne afficiantur was a law of the twelve tables, and De\nmortuis nil nisi bonum is an excellent injunction--even if the dead in\nquestion be nothing but dead small beer. It is not my design, therefore,\nto vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad dog, it is\ntrue, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was not to\nblame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his mother.\nShe did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant--for duties\nto her well--regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies, like\ntough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the better\nfor beating--but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be left-handed,\nand a child flogged left-handedly had better be left unflogged. The\nworld revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a baby from\nleft to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an evil\npropensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks\nits quota of wickedness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements,\nand, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was\ngetting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in\nmy eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when\nhe had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might\nhave mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced\nbeyond that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand\nit no longer, but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my\nvoice, made prophecy of his ruin.\n\nThe fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age\nhe used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At\nsix months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he\nwas in the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies.\nAt eight months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the\nTemperance pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after\nmonth, until, at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon\nwearing moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and\nswearing, and for backing his assertions by bets.\n\nThrough this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had\npredicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown\nwith his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when\nhe came to be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without\ninterlarding it with a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid\nwagers--no. I will do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon\nhave laid eggs. With him the thing was a mere formula--nothing more. His\nexpressions on this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They\nwere simple if not altogether innocent expletives--imaginative phrases\nwherewith to round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you so and\nso,” nobody ever thought of taking him up; but still I could not help\nthinking it my duty to put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and\nso I told him. It was a vulgar one--this I begged him to believe. It was\ndiscountenanced by society--here I said nothing but the truth. It was\nforbidden by act of Congress--here I had not the slightest intention\nof telling a lie. I remonstrated--but to no purpose. I demonstrated--in\nvain. I entreated--he smiled. I implored--he laughed. I preached--he\nsneered. I threatened--he swore. I kicked him--he called for the police.\nI pulled his nose--he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil his head\nthat I would not venture to try that experiment again.\n\nPoverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of\nDammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and\nthis was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about\nbetting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that\nI ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “I’ll bet you a\ndollar.” It was usually “I’ll bet you what you please,” or “I’ll bet you\nwhat you dare,” or “I’ll bet you a trifle,” or else, more significantly\nstill, “I’ll bet the Devil my head.”\n\nThis latter form seemed to please him best;--perhaps because it involved\nthe least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious. Had any\none taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have been\nsmall too. But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure\nthat I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the phrase in\nquestion grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of\na man betting his brains like bank-notes:--but this was a point which my\nfriend’s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend.\nIn the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up\nto “I’ll bet the Devil my head,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness\nof devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. I am always\ndispleased by circumstances for which I cannot account. Mysteries\nforce a man to think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there was\nsomething in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to\nhis offensive expression--something in his manner of enunciation--which\nat first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy--something\nwhich, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted\nto call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical,\nMr. Kant pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson\nhyperquizzitistical. I began not to like it at all. Mr. Dammits soul was\nin a perilous state. I resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to\nsave it. I vowed to serve him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is\nsaid to have served the toad,--that is to say, “awaken him to a sense\nof his situation.” I addressed myself to the task forthwith. Once more I\nbetook myself to remonstrance. Again I collected my energies for a final\nattempt at expostulation.\n\nWhen I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit indulged himself in\nsome very equivocal behavior. For some moments he remained silent,\nmerely looking me inquisitively in the face. But presently he threw his\nhead to one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent. Then he\nspread out the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he\nwinked with the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left.\nThen he shut them both up very tight. Then he opened them both so\nvery wide that I became seriously alarmed for the consequences.\nThen, applying his thumb to his nose, he thought proper to make an\nindescribable movement with the rest of his fingers. Finally, setting\nhis arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.\n\nI can call to mind only the beads of his discourse. He would be obliged\nto me if I would hold my tongue. He wished none of my advice. He\ndespised all my insinuations. He was old enough to take care of himself.\nDid I still think him baby Dammit? Did I mean to say any thing against\nhis character? Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool? Was my maternal\nparent aware, in a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence?\nHe would put this latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and\nhe would bind himself to abide by my reply. Once more he would demand\nexplicitly if my mother knew that I was out. My confusion, he said,\nbetrayed me, and he would be willing to bet the Devil his head that she\ndid not.\n\nMr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he\nleft my presence with undignified precipitation. It was well for him\nthat he did so. My feelings had been wounded. Even my anger had been\naroused. For once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. I\nwould have won for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit’s little head--for the fact\nis, my mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from\nhome.\n\nBut Khoda shefa midêhed--Heaven gives relief--as the Mussulmans say when\nyou tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I had\nbeen insulted, and I bore the insult like a man. It now seemed to me,\nhowever, that I had done all that could be required of me, in the case\nof this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no longer\nwith my counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. But\nalthough I forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself\nto give up his society altogether. I even went so far as to humor some\nof his less reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I\nfound myself lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with\ntears in my eyes:--so profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.\n\nOne fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led\nus in the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to\ncross it. It was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and\nthe archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark.\nAs we entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and\nthe interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those\nof the unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was\nhipped. He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively\nlively--so much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy\nsuspicion. It is not impossible that he was affected with the\ntranscendentals. I am not well enough versed, however, in the diagnosis\nof this disease to speak with decision upon the point; and unhappily\nthere were none of my friends of the “Dial” present. I suggest the idea,\nnevertheless, because of a certain species of austere Merry-Andrewism\nwhich seemed to beset my poor friend, and caused him to make quite a\nTom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve him but wriggling and skipping\nabout under and over every thing that came in his way; now shouting\nout, and now lisping out, all manner of odd little and big words, yet\npreserving the gravest face in the world all the time. I really could\nnot make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him. At length, having\npassed nearly across the bridge, we approached the termination of the\nfootway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile of some height.\nThrough this I made my way quietly, pushing it around as usual. But this\nturn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit. He insisted upon leaping\nthe stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the air. Now\nthis, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The best\npigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and as\nI knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done\nby Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a\nbraggadocio, and could not do what he said. For this I had reason to be\nsorry afterward;--for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his head\nthat he could.\n\nI was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some\nremonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a\nslight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ahem!” I\nstarted, and looked about me in surprise. My glance at length fell into\na nook of the frame--work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a little\nlame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing could be more reverend\nthan his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of black,\nbut his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly down\nover a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a girl’s.\nHis hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and his two\neyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.\n\nUpon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk\napron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very\nodd. Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a\ncircumstance, he interrupted me with a second “ahem!”\n\nTo this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply. The fact\nis, remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. I have known\na Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word “Fudge!” I am not ashamed to\nsay, therefore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance.\n\n“Dammit,” said I, “what are you about? don’t you hear?--the gentleman\nsays ‘ahem!’” I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him;\nfor, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is\nparticularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he\nis pretty sure to look like a fool.\n\n“Dammit,” observed I--although this sounded very much like an oath, than\nwhich nothing was further from my thoughts--“Dammit,” I suggested--“the\ngentleman says ‘ahem!’”\n\nI do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did\nnot think it profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our\nspeeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own\neyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb,\nor knocked him in the head with the “Poets and Poetry of America,” he\ncould hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with\nthose simple words: “Dammit, what are you about?--don’t you hear?--the\ngentleman says ‘ahem!’”\n\n“You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning more colors than\na pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. “Are\nyou quite sure he said that? Well, at all events I am in for it now, and\nmay as well put a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then--ahem!”\n\nAt this the little old gentleman seemed pleased--God only knows why.\nHe left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a\ngracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially,\nlooking all the while straight up in his face with an air of the most\nunadulterated benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to\nimagine.\n\n“I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit,” said he, with the frankest of\nall smiles, “but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake\nof mere form.”\n\n“Ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying\na pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable\nalteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down\nthe corners of his mouth--“ahem!” And “ahem!” said he again, after a\npause; and not another word more than “ahem!” did I ever know him to say\nafter that. “Aha!” thought I, without expressing myself aloud--“this is\nquite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt\na consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. One extreme\ninduces another. I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable\nquestions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave\nhim my last lecture? At all events, he is cured of the transcendentals.”\n\n“Ahem!” here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts,\nand looking like a very old sheep in a revery.\n\nThe old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the\nshade of the bridge--a few paces back from the turnstile. “My good\nfellow,” said he, “I make it a point of conscience to allow you this\nmuch run. Wait here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may\nsee whether you go over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t\nomit any flourishes of the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you know. I will\nsay ‘one, two, three, and away.’ Mind you, start at the word ‘away’”\n Here he took his position by the stile, paused a moment as if in\nprofound reflection, then looked up and, I thought, smiled very\nslightly, then tightened the strings of his apron, then took a long look\nat Dammit, and finally gave the word as agreed upon-\n\n            _One--two--three--and--away!_\n\nPunctually at the word “away,” my poor friend set off in a strong\ngallop. The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord’s--nor yet very low,\nlike that of Mr. Lord’s reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure\nthat he would clear it. And then what if he did not?--ah, that was\nthe question--what if he did not? “What right,” said I, “had the\nold gentleman to make any other gentleman jump? The little old\ndot-and-carry-one! who is he? If he asks me to jump, I won’t do it,\nthat’s flat, and I don’t care who the devil he is.” The bridge, as I\nsay, was arched and covered in, in a very ridiculous manner, and there\nwas a most uncomfortable echo about it at all times--an echo which I\nnever before so particularly observed as when I uttered the four last\nwords of my remark.\n\nBut what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an\ninstant. In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had\ntaken the leap. I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor\nof the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he\nwent up. I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration\njust over the top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually\nsingular thing that he did not continue to go over. But the whole leap\nwas the affair of a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any\nprofound reflections, down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back,\non the same side of the stile from which he had started. At the same\ninstant I saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed,\nhaving caught and wrapt up in his apron something that fell heavily into\nit from the darkness of the arch just over the turnstile. At all this\nI was much astonished; but I had no leisure to think, for Dammit lay\nparticularly still, and I concluded that his feelings had been hurt, and\nthat he stood in need of my assistance. I hurried up to him and found\nthat he had received what might be termed a serious injury. The truth\nis, he had been deprived of his head, which after a close search I could\nnot find anywhere; so I determined to take him home and send for the\nhomoeopathists. In the meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open\nan adjacent window of the bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at\nonce. About five feet just above the top of the turnstile, and crossing\nthe arch of the foot-path so as to constitute a brace, there extended a\nflat iron bar, lying with its breadth horizontally, and forming one of\na series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent.\nWith the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my\nunfortunate friend had come precisely in contact.\n\nHe did not long survive his terrible loss. The homoeopathists did not\ngive him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he\nhesitated to take. So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a\nlesson to all riotous livers. I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked\na bar sinister on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses\nof his funeral, sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists.\nThe scoundrels refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once,\nand sold him for dog’s meat.\n\n","The widely discussed possibility of an invasion of England through a\nChannel tunnel has more than once recalled old Solomon Selby's story to\nmy mind.\n\nThe occasion on which I numbered myself among his audience was one\nevening when he was sitting in the yawning chimney-corner of the\ninn-kitchen, with some others who had gathered there, and I entered for\nshelter from the rain.  Withdrawing the stem of his pipe from the dental\nnotch in which it habitually rested, he leaned back in the recess behind\nhim and smiled into the fire.  The smile was neither mirthful nor sad,\nnot precisely humorous nor altogether thoughtful.  We who knew him\nrecognized it in a moment: it was his narrative smile.  Breaking off our\nfew desultory remarks we drew up closer, and he thus began:--\n\n'My father, as you mid know, was a shepherd all his life, and lived out\nby the Cove four miles yonder, where I was born and lived likewise, till\nI moved here shortly afore I was married.  The cottage that first knew me\nstood on the top of the down, near the sea; there was no house within a\nmile and a half of it; it was built o' purpose for the farm-shepherd, and\nhad no other use.  They tell me that it is now pulled down, but that you\ncan see where it stood by the mounds of earth and a few broken bricks\nthat are still lying about.  It was a bleak and dreary place in winter-\ntime, but in summer it was well enough, though the garden never came to\nmuch, because we could not get up a good shelter for the vegetables and\ncurrant bushes; and where there is much wind they don't thrive.\n\n'Of all the years of my growing up the ones that bide clearest in my mind\nwere eighteen hundred and three, four, and five.  This was for two\nreasons: I had just then grown to an age when a child's eyes and ears\ntake in and note down everything about him, and there was more at that\ndate to bear in mind than there ever has been since with me.  It was, as\nI need hardly tell ye, the time after the first peace, when Bonaparte was\nscheming his descent upon England.  He had crossed the great Alp\nmountains, fought in Egypt, drubbed the Turks, the Austrians, and the\nProossians, and now thought he'd have a slap at us.  On the other side of\nthe Channel, scarce out of sight and hail of a man standing on our\nEnglish shore, the French army of a hundred and sixty thousand men and\nfifteen thousand horses had been brought together from all parts, and\nwere drilling every day.  Bonaparte had been three years a-making his\npreparations; and to ferry these soldiers and cannon and horses across he\nhad contrived a couple of thousand flat-bottomed boats.  These boats were\nsmall things, but wonderfully built.  A good few of 'em were so made as\nto have a little stable on board each for the two horses that were to\nhaul the cannon carried at the stern.  To get in order all these, and\nother things required, he had assembled there five or six thousand\nfellows that worked at trades--carpenters, blacksmiths, wheelwrights,\nsaddlers, and what not.  O 'twas a curious time!\n\n'Every morning Neighbour Boney would muster his multitude of soldiers on\nthe beach, draw 'em up in line, practise 'em in the manoeuvre of\nembarking, horses and all, till they could do it without a single hitch.\nMy father drove a flock of ewes up into Sussex that year, and as he went\nalong the drover's track over the high downs thereabout he could see this\ndrilling actually going on--the accoutrements of the rank and file\nglittering in the sun like silver.  It was thought and always said by my\nuncle Job, sergeant of foot (who used to know all about these matters),\nthat Bonaparte meant to cross with oars on a calm night.  The grand query\nwith us was, Where would my gentleman land?  Many of the common people\nthought it would be at Dover; others, who knew how unlikely it was that\nany skilful general would make a business of landing just where he was\nexpected, said he'd go either east into the River Thames, or west'ard to\nsome convenient place, most likely one of the little bays inside the Isle\nof Portland, between the Beal and St. Alban's Head--and for choice the\nthree-quarter-round Cove, screened from every mortal eye, that seemed\nmade o' purpose, out by where we lived, and which I've climmed up with\ntwo tubs of brandy across my shoulders on scores o' dark nights in my\nyounger days.  Some had heard that a part o' the French fleet would sail\nright round Scotland, and come up the Channel to a suitable haven.\nHowever, there was much doubt upon the matter; and no wonder, for after-\nyears proved that Bonaparte himself could hardly make up his mind upon\nthat great and very particular point, where to land.  His uncertainty\ncame about in this wise, that he could get no news as to where and how\nour troops lay in waiting, and that his knowledge of possible places\nwhere flat-bottomed boats might be quietly run ashore, and the men they\nbrought marshalled in order, was dim to the last degree.  Being\nflat-bottomed, they didn't require a harbour for unshipping their cargo\nof men, but a good shelving beach away from sight, and with a fair open\nroad toward London.  How the question posed that great Corsican tyrant\n(as we used to call him), what pains he took to settle it, and, above\nall, what a risk he ran on one particular night in trying to do so, were\nknown only to one man here and there; and certainly to no maker of\nnewspapers or printer of books, or my account o't would not have had so\nmany heads shaken over it as it has by gentry who only believe what they\nsee in printed lines.\n\n'The flocks my father had charge of fed all about the downs near our\nhouse, overlooking the sea and shore each way for miles.  In winter and\nearly spring father was up a deal at nights, watching and tending the\nlambing.  Often he'd go to bed early, and turn out at twelve or one; and\non the other hand, he'd sometimes stay up till twelve or one, and then\nturn in to bed.  As soon as I was old enough I used to help him, mostly\nin the way of keeping an eye upon the ewes while he was gone home to\nrest.  This is what I was doing in a particular month in either the year\nfour or five--I can't certainly fix which, but it was long before I was\ntook away from the sheepkeeping to be bound prentice to a trade.  Every\nnight at that time I was at the fold, about half a mile, or it may be a\nlittle more, from our cottage, and no living thing at all with me but the\newes and young lambs.  Afeard?  No; I was never afeard of being alone at\nthese times; for I had been reared in such an out-step place that the\nlack o' human beings at night made me less fearful than the sight of 'em.\nDirectly I saw a man's shape after dark in a lonely place I was\nfrightened out of my senses.\n\n'One day in that month we were surprised by a visit from my uncle Job,\nthe sergeant in the Sixty-first foot, then in camp on the downs above\nKing George's watering-place, several miles to the west yonder.  Uncle\nJob dropped in about dusk, and went up with my father to the fold for an\nhour or two.  Then he came home, had a drop to drink from the tub of\nsperrits that the smugglers kept us in for housing their liquor when\nthey'd made a run, and for burning 'em off when there was danger.  After\nthat he stretched himself out on the settle to sleep.  I went to bed: at\none o'clock father came home, and waking me to go and take his place,\naccording to custom, went to bed himself.  On my way out of the house I\npassed Uncle Job on the settle.  He opened his eyes, and upon my telling\nhim where I was going he said it was a shame that such a youngster as I\nshould go up there all alone; and when he had fastened up his stock and\nwaist-belt he set off along with me, taking a drop from the sperrit-tub\nin a little flat bottle that stood in the corner-cupboard.\n\n'By and by we drew up to the fold, saw that all was right, and then, to\nkeep ourselves warm, curled up in a heap of straw that lay inside the\nthatched hurdles we had set up to break the stroke of the wind when there\nwas any.  To-night, however, there was none.  It was one of those very\nstill nights when, if you stand on the high hills anywhere within two or\nthree miles of the sea, you can hear the rise and fall of the tide along\nthe shore, coming and going every few moments like a sort of great snore\nof the sleeping world.  Over the lower ground there was a bit of a mist,\nbut on the hill where we lay the air was clear, and the moon, then in her\nlast quarter, flung a fairly good light on the grass and scattered straw.\n\n'While we lay there Uncle Job amused me by telling me strange stories of\nthe wars he had served in and the wounds he had got.  He had already\nfought the French in the Low Countries, and hoped to fight 'em again.  His\nstories lasted so long that at last I was hardly sure that I was not a\nsoldier myself, and had seen such service as he told of.  The wonders of\nhis tales quite bewildered my mind, till I fell asleep and dreamed of\nbattle, smoke, and flying soldiers, all of a kind with the doings he had\nbeen bringing up to me.\n\n'How long my nap lasted I am not prepared to say.  But some faint sounds\nover and above the rustle of the ewes in the straw, the bleat of the\nlambs, and the tinkle of the sheep-bell brought me to my waking senses.\nUncle Job was still beside me; but he too had fallen asleep.  I looked\nout from the straw, and saw what it was that had aroused me.  Two men, in\nboat-cloaks, cocked hats, and swords, stood by the hurdles about twenty\nyards off.\n\n'I turned my ear thitherward to catch what they were saying, but though I\nheard every word o't, not one did I understand.  They spoke in a tongue\nthat was not ours--in French, as I afterward found.  But if I could not\ngain the meaning of a word, I was shrewd boy enough to find out a deal of\nthe talkers' business.  By the light o' the moon I could see that one of\n'em carried a roll of paper in his hand, while every moment he spoke\nquick to his comrade, and pointed right and left with the other hand to\nspots along the shore.  There was no doubt that he was explaining to the\nsecond gentleman the shapes and features of the coast.  What happened\nsoon after made this still clearer to me.\n\n'All this time I had not waked Uncle Job, but now I began to be afeared\nthat they might light upon us, because uncle breathed so heavily\nthrough's nose.  I put my mouth to his ear and whispered, \"Uncle Job.\"\n\n'\"What is it, my boy?\" he said, just as if he hadn't been asleep at all.\n\n'\"Hush!\" says I.  \"Two French generals--\"\n\n'\"French?\" says he.\n\n'\"Yes,\" says I.  \"Come to see where to land their army!\"\n\n'I pointed 'em out; but I could say no more, for the pair were coming at\nthat moment much nearer to where we lay.  As soon as they got as near as\neight or ten yards, the officer with a roll in his hand stooped down to a\nslanting hurdle, unfastened his roll upon it, and spread it out.  Then\nsuddenly he sprung a dark lantern open on the paper, and showed it to be\na map.\n\n'\"What be they looking at?\" I whispered to Uncle Job.\n\n'\"A chart of the Channel,\" says the sergeant (knowing about such things).\n\n'The other French officer now stooped likewise, and over the map they had\na long consultation, as they pointed here and there on the paper, and\nthen hither and thither at places along the shore beneath us.  I noticed\nthat the manner of one officer was very respectful toward the other, who\nseemed much his superior, the second in rank calling him by a sort of\ntitle that I did not know the sense of.  The head one, on the other hand,\nwas quite familiar with his friend, and more than once clapped him on the\nshoulder.\n\n'Uncle Job had watched as well as I, but though the map had been in the\nlantern-light, their faces had always been in shade.  But when they rose\nfrom stooping over the chart the light flashed upward, and fell smart\nupon one of 'em's features.  No sooner had this happened than Uncle Job\ngasped, and sank down as if he'd been in a fit.\n\n'\"What is it--what is it, Uncle Job?\" said I.\n\n'\"O good God!\" says he, under the straw.\n\n'\"What?\" says I.\n\n'\"Boney!\" he groaned out.\n\n'\"Who?\" says I.\n\n'\"Bonaparty,\" he said.  \"The Corsican ogre.  O that I had got but my new-\nflinted firelock, that there man should die!  But I haven't got my new-\nflinted firelock, and that there man must live.  So lie low, as you value\nyour life!\"\n\n'I did lie low, as you mid suppose.  But I couldn't help peeping.  And\nthen I too, lad as I was, knew that it was the face of Bonaparte.  Not\nknow Boney?  I should think I did know Boney.  I should have known him by\nhalf the light o' that lantern.  If I had seen a picture of his features\nonce, I had seen it a hundred times.  There was his bullet head, his\nshort neck, his round yaller cheeks and chin, his gloomy face, and his\ngreat glowing eyes.  He took off his hat to blow himself a bit, and there\nwas the forelock in the middle of his forehead, as in all the draughts of\nhim.  In moving, his cloak fell a little open, and I could see for a\nmoment his white-fronted jacket and one of his epaulets.\n\n'But none of this lasted long.  In a minute he and his general had rolled\nup the map, shut the lantern, and turned to go down toward the shore.\n\n'Then Uncle Job came to himself a bit.  \"Slipped across in the night-time\nto see how to put his men ashore,\" he said.  \"The like o' that man's\ncoolness eyes will never again see!  Nephew, I must act in this, and\nimmediate, or England's lost!\"\n\n'When they were over the brow, we crope out, and went some little way to\nlook after them.  Half-way down they were joined by two others, and six\nor seven minutes brought them to the shore.  Then, from behind a rock, a\nboat came out into the weak moonlight of the Cove, and they jumped in; it\nput off instantly, and vanished in a few minutes between the two rocks\nthat stand at the mouth of the Cove as we all know.  We climmed back to\nwhere we had been before, and I could see, a little way out, a larger\nvessel, though still not very large.  The little boat drew up alongside,\nwas made fast at the stern as I suppose, for the largest sailed away, and\nwe saw no more.\n\n'My uncle Job told his officers as soon as he got back to camp; but what\nthey thought of it I never heard--neither did he.  Boney's army never\ncame, and a good job for me; for the Cove below my father's house was\nwhere he meant to land, as this secret visit showed.  We coast-folk\nshould have been cut down one and all, and I should not have sat here to\ntell this tale.'\n\nWe who listened to old Selby that night have been familiar with his\nsimple grave-stone for these ten years past.  Thanks to the incredulity\nof the age his tale has been seldom repeated.  But if anything short of\nthe direct testimony of his own eyes could persuade an auditor that\nBonaparte had examined these shores for himself with a view to a\npracticable landing-place, it would have been Solomon Selby's manner of\nnarrating the adventure which befell him on the down.\n\n","\nTHE _symposium_ of the preceding evening had been a little too much\nfor my nerves. I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy.\nInstead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed,\nit occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a\nmouthful of supper and go immediately to bed.\n\nA light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit. More\nthan a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable. Still,\nthere can be no material objection to two. And really between two and\nthree, there is merely a single unit of difference. I ventured, perhaps,\nupon four. My wife will have it five;--but, clearly, she has confounded\ntwo very distinct affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to\nadmit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout,\nwithout which, in the way of condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.\n\nHaving thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the\nserene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon\nthe pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a\nprofound slumber forthwith.\n\nBut when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? I could not have\ncompleted my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the\nstreet-door bell, and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which\nawakened me at once. In a minute afterward, and while I was still\nrubbing my eyes, my wife thrust in my face a note, from my old friend,\nDoctor Ponnonner. It ran thus:\n\n      “Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you\n receive this. Come and help us to rejoice. At last, by long persevering\n diplomacy, I have gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum,\n to my examination of the Mummy--you know the one I mean. I have\n permission to unswathe it and open it, if desirable. A few friends only\n will be present--you, of course. The Mummy is now at my house, and we\n shall begin to unroll it at eleven to-night.\n\n           “Yours, ever,\n\n                   PONNONNER.\n\nBy the time I had reached the “Ponnonner,” it struck me that I was\nas wide awake as a man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy,\noverthrowing all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly\nmarvellous; and set off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor’s.\n\nThere I found a very eager company assembled. They had been awaiting me\nwith much impatience; the Mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and\nthe moment I entered its examination was commenced.\n\nIt was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain\nArthur Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner’s from a tomb near Eleithias, in\nthe Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile.\nThe grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban\nsepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more\nnumerous illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians. The chamber\nfrom which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such\nillustrations; the walls being completely covered with fresco paintings\nand bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich patterns,\nindicated the vast wealth of the deceased.\n\nThe treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same\ncondition in which Captain Sabretash had found it;--that is to say,\nthe coffin had not been disturbed. For eight years it had thus stood,\nsubject only externally to public inspection. We had now, therefore,\nthe complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very\nrarely the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident,\nat once that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good\nfortune.\n\nApproaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven\nfeet long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. It\nwas oblong--not coffin-shaped. The material was at first supposed to\nbe the wood of the sycamore (_platanus_), but, upon cutting into it, we\nfound it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, _papier mache_, composed\nof papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings, representing\nfuneral scenes, and other mournful subjects--interspersed among which,\nin every variety of position, were certain series of hieroglyphical\ncharacters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the departed. By good\nluck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no difficulty in\ntranslating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and represented the\nword _Allamistakeo_.\n\nWe had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury;\nbut having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second,\ncoffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one,\nbut resembling it precisely in every other respect. The interval between\nthe two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the\ncolors of the interior box.\n\nUpon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a\nthird case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no\nparticular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still\nemitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood. Between\nthe second and the third case there was no interval--the one fitting\naccurately within the other.\n\nRemoving the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself.\nWe had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or\nbandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath,\nmade of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and\npainted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the\nvarious supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different\ndivinities, with numerous identical human figures, intended, very\nprobably, as portraits of the persons embalmed. Extending from head\nto foot was a columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic\nhieroglyphics, giving again his name and titles, and the names and\ntitles of his relations.\n\nAround the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass\nbeads, diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities,\nof the scarabaeus, etc, with the winged globe. Around the small of the\nwaist was a similar collar or belt.\n\nStripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation,\nwith no perceptible odor. The color was reddish. The skin was hard,\nsmooth, and glossy. The teeth and hair were in good condition. The eyes\n(it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were\nvery beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat\ntoo determined a stare. The fingers and the nails were brilliantly\ngilded.\n\nMr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the\nembalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping\nthe surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of\nthe powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented\ngums became apparent.\n\nWe searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through\nwhich the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could\ndiscover none. No member of the party was at that period aware that\nentire or unopened mummies are not infrequently met. The brain it\nwas customary to withdraw through the nose; the intestines through an\nincision in the side; the body was then shaved, washed, and salted; then\nlaid aside for several weeks, when the operation of embalming, properly\nso called, began.\n\nAs no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor Ponnonner was preparing\nhis instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past\ntwo o’clock. Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination\nuntil the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present,\nwhen some one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.\n\nThe application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years\nold at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently\noriginal, and we all caught it at once. About one-tenth in earnest and\nnine-tenths in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor’s study, and\nconveyed thither the Egyptian.\n\nIt was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some\nportions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity\nthan other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of\ncourse, gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in\ncontact with the wire. This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive,\nand, with a hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each\nother good night, when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the\nMummy, were there immediately riveted in amazement. My brief glance, in\nfact, had sufficed to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed\nto be glass, and which were originally noticeable for a certain wild\nstare, were now so far covered by the lids, that only a small portion of\nthe _tunica albuginea_ remained visible.\n\nWith a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately\nobvious to all.\n\nI cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because “alarmed” is,\nin my case, not exactly the word. It is possible, however, that, but for\nthe Brown Stout, I might have been a little nervous. As for the rest\nof the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright\nfright which possessed them. Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied.\nMr. Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. Mr.\nSilk Buckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he\nmade his way, upon all fours, under the table.\n\nAfter the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter\nof course, upon further experiment forthwith. Our operations were now\ndirected against the great toe of the right foot. We made an incision\nover the outside of the exterior _os sesamoideum pollicis pedis,_ and\nthus got at the root of the abductor muscle. Readjusting the battery, we\nnow applied the fluid to the bisected nerves--when, with a movement of\nexceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to\nbring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the\nlimb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner,\nwhich had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a\ncatapult, through a window into the street below.\n\nWe rushed out _en masse_ to bring in the mangled remains of the victim,\nbut had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in an\nunaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more\nthan ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment\nwith vigor and with zeal.\n\nIt was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a\nprofound incision into the tip of the subject’s nose, while the Doctor\nhimself, laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact\nwith the wire.\n\nMorally and physically--figuratively and literally--was the effect\nelectric. In the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked very\nrapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime, in the\nsecond place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the fourth,\nit shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner’s face; in the fifth, turning to\nMessieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, it addressed them, in very capital\nEgyptian, thus:\n\n“I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at\nyour behavior. Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected. He\nis a poor little fat fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive him.\nBut you, Mr. Gliddon--and you, Silk--who have travelled and resided in\nEgypt until one might imagine you to the manner born--you, I say who\nhave been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I\nthink, as you write your mother tongue--you, whom I have always been\nled to regard as the firm friend of the mummies--I really did anticipate\nmore gentlemanly conduct from you. What am I to think of your standing\nquietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? What am I to suppose by\nyour permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins, and my\nclothes, in this wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to come to the\npoint) am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little\nvillain, Doctor Ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?”\n\nIt will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech\nunder the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into\nviolent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon. One of these three\nthings was, I say, to be expected. Indeed each and all of these lines of\nconduct might have been very plausibly pursued. And, upon my word, I am\nat a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor\nthe other. But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit\nof the age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and\nis now usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of\nparadox and impossibility. Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the\nMummy’s exceedingly natural and matter-of-course air that divested his\nwords of the terrible. However this may be, the facts are clear, and no\nmember of our party betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed\nto consider that any thing had gone very especially wrong.\n\nFor my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside,\nout of the range of the Egyptian’s fist. Doctor Ponnonner thrust his\nhands into his breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew\nexcessively red in the face. Mr. Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew\nup the collar of his shirt. Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put\nhis right thumb into the left corner of his mouth.\n\nThe Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and\nat length, with a sneer, said:\n\n“Why don’t you speak, Mr. Buckingham? Did you hear what I asked you, or\nnot? Do take your thumb out of your mouth!”\n\nMr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out\nof the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted\nhis left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.\n\nNot being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly\nto Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms\nwhat we all meant.\n\nMr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the\ndeficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would\nafford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of\nhis very excellent speech.\n\nI may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent\nconversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive\nEgyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other\nuntravelled members of the company)--through the medium, I say, of\nMessieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters. These gentlemen spoke\nthe mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I\ncould not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of\nimages entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger)\nthe two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of\nsensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning.\nMr. Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian\ncomprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon the wall, with\na bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows,\nstanding upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown\nforward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and\nthe mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees. Just in the same way Mr.\nBuckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea “wig,” until\n(at Doctor Ponnonner’s suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and\nconsented to take off his own.\n\nIt will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon’s discourse turned\nchiefly upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling\nand disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any\ndisturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the\nindividual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint\n(for it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little\nmatters were now explained, it might be as well to proceed with\nthe investigation intended. Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his\ninstruments.\n\nIn regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that\nAllamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I\ndid not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the\napologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with\nthe company all round.\n\nWhen this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in\nrepairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel.\nWe sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a\nsquare inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.\n\nIt was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of\nAllamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering--no doubt from the cold. The\nDoctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with\na black dress coat, made in Jennings’ best manner, a pair of sky-blue\nplaid pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of\nbrocade, a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with\nno brim, patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a\npair of whiskers, and a waterfall cravat. Owing to the disparity of size\nbetween the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one),\nthere was some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the\nperson of the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been\nsaid to be dressed. Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led\nhim to a comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell\nupon the spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.\n\nThe conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course,\nexpressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo’s\nstill remaining alive.\n\n“I should have thought,” observed Mr. Buckingham, “that it is high time\nyou were dead.”\n\n“Why,” replied the Count, very much astonished, “I am little more than\nseven hundred years old! My father lived a thousand, and was by no means\nin his dotage when he died.”\n\nHere ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of\nwhich it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly\nmisjudged. It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months\nsince he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.\n\n“But my remark,” resumed Mr. Buckingham, “had no reference to your age\nat the period of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are\nstill a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during\nwhich, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum.”\n\n“In what?” said the Count.\n\n“In asphaltum,” persisted Mr. B.\n\n“Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made\nto answer, no doubt--but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else\nthan the Bichloride of Mercury.”\n\n“But what we are especially at a loss to understand,” said Doctor\nPonnonner, “is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt\nfive thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so\ndelightfully well.”\n\n“Had I been, as you say, dead,” replied the Count, “it is more than\nprobable that dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the\ninfancy of Calvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common\nthing among us in the old days. But the fact is, I fell into catalepsy,\nand it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or\nshould be; they accordingly embalmed me at once--I presume you are aware\nof the chief principle of the embalming process?”\n\n“Why not altogether.”\n\n“Why, I perceive--a deplorable condition of ignorance! Well I cannot\nenter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to\nembalm (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the\nanimal functions subjected to the process. I use the word ‘animal’ in\nits widest sense, as including the physical not more than the moral\nand vital being. I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment\nconsisted, with us, in the immediately arresting, and holding in\nperpetual abeyance, all the animal functions subjected to the process.\nTo be brief, in whatever condition the individual was, at the period of\nembalmment, in that condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune\nto be of the blood of the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see\nme at present.”\n\n“The blood of the Scarabaeus!” exclaimed Doctor Ponnonner.\n\n“Yes. The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the ‘arms,’ of a very\ndistinguished and very rare patrician family. To be ‘of the blood of the\nScarabaeus,’ is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus\nis the insignium. I speak figuratively.”\n\n“But what has this to do with you being alive?”\n\n“Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before\nembalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone\ndid not coincide with the custom. Had I not been a Scarabeus, therefore,\nI should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is\ninconvenient to live.”\n\n“I perceive that,” said Mr. Buckingham, “and I presume that all the\nentire mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei.”\n\n“Beyond doubt.”\n\n“I thought,” said Mr. Gliddon, very meekly, “that the Scarabaeus was one\nof the Egyptian gods.”\n\n“One of the Egyptian _what?”_ exclaimed the Mummy, starting to its feet.\n\n“Gods!” repeated the traveller.\n\n“Mr. Gliddon, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,”\n said the Count, resuming his chair. “No nation upon the face of the\nearth has ever acknowledged more than one god. The Scarabaeus, the Ibis,\netc., were with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the\nsymbols, or media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too\naugust to be more directly approached.”\n\nThere was here a pause. At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor\nPonnonner.\n\n“It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,” said he,\n“that among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of\nthe Scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality?”\n\n“There can be no question of it,” replied the Count; “all the Scarabaei\nembalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now. Even some of those\npurposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and\nstill remain in the tomb.”\n\n“Will you be kind enough to explain,” I said, “what you mean by\n‘purposely so embalmed’?”\n\n“With great pleasure!” answered the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely\nthrough his eye-glass--for it was the first time I had ventured to\naddress him a direct question.\n\n“With great pleasure,” he said. “The usual duration of man’s life, in\nmy time, was about eight hundred years. Few men died, unless by most\nextraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer\nthan a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural\nterm. After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already\ndescribed it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable\ncuriosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of\nscience much advanced, by living this natural term in installments. In\nthe case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of\nthis kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained\nthe age of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then\nget himself carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors\npro tem., that they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of\na certain period--say five or six hundred years. Resuming existence at\nthe expiration of this time, he would invariably find his great work\nconverted into a species of hap-hazard note-book--that is to say, into\na kind of literary arena for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and\npersonal squabbles of whole herds of exasperated commentators.\nThese guesses, etc., which passed under the name of annotations, or\nemendations, were found so completely to have enveloped, distorted, and\noverwhelmed the text, that the author had to go about with a lantern to\ndiscover his own book. When discovered, it was never worth the trouble\nof the search. After re-writing it throughout, it was regarded as the\nbounden duty of the historian to set himself to work immediately\nin correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience, the\ntraditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally\nlived. Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification,\npursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of\npreventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said Doctor Ponnonner at this point, laying his\nhand gently upon the arm of the Egyptian--“I beg your pardon, sir, but\nmay I presume to interrupt you for one moment?”\n\n“By all means, sir,” replied the Count, drawing up.\n\n“I merely wished to ask you a question,” said the Doctor. “You mentioned\nthe historian’s personal correction of traditions respecting his own\nepoch. Pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were\nusually found to be right?”\n\n“The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered\nto be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written\nhistories themselves;--that is to say, not one individual iota of either\nwas ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and radically\nwrong.”\n\n“But since it is quite clear,” resumed the Doctor, “that at least five\nthousand years have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for\ngranted that your histories at that period, if not your traditions\nwere sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the\nCreation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten\ncenturies before.”\n\n“Sir!” said the Count Allamistakeo.\n\nThe Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional\nexplanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. The\nlatter at length said, hesitatingly:\n\n“The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel.\nDuring my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy\nas that the universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had\na beginning at all. I remember once, and once only, hearing something\nremotely hinted, by a man of many speculations, concerning the origin\n_of the human race;_ and by this individual, the very word _Adam_\n(or Red Earth), which you make use of, was employed. He employed\nit, however, in a generical sense, with reference to the spontaneous\ngermination from rank soil (just as a thousand of the lower genera of\ncreatures are germinated)--the spontaneous germination, I say, of five\nvast hordes of men, simultaneously upspringing in five distinct and\nnearly equal divisions of the globe.”\n\nHere, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or\ntwo of us touched our foreheads with a very significant air. Mr. Silk\nBuckingham, first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the\nsinciput of Allamistakeo, spoke as follows:\n\n“The long duration of human life in your time, together with\nthe occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in\ninstallments, must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general\ndevelopment and conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore, that\nwe are to attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in\nall particulars of science, when compared with the moderns, and more\nespecially with the Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the\nEgyptian skull.”\n\n“I confess again,” replied the Count, with much suavity, “that I am\nsomewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of\nscience do you allude?”\n\nHere our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the\nassumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.\n\nHaving heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few\nanecdotes, which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and\nSpurzheim had flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been\nnearly forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very\ncontemptible tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles\nof the Theban savans, who created lice and a great many other similar\nthings.\n\nI here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He\nsmiled rather contemptuously, and said they were.\n\nThis put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard\nto his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had\nnever as yet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information\non this head, I had better consult Ptolemy (whoever Ptolemy is), as well\nas one Plutarch de facie lunae.\n\nI then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in\ngeneral, about the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my\nqueries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow,\nand begged me for God’s sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus. As\nfor the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns\npossessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the\nstyle of the Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer\nthis question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very\nextraordinary way.\n\n“Look at our architecture!” he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of\nboth the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.\n\n“Look,” he cried with enthusiasm, “at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New\nYork! or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the\nCapitol at Washington, D. C.!”--and the good little medical man went\non to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he\nreferred. He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less\nthan four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.\n\nThe Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just\nat that moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal\nbuildings of the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night\nof Time, but the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of\nhis entombment, in a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes. He\nrecollected, however, (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to\nan inferior palace in a kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a\nhundred and forty-four columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and\ntwenty-five feet apart. The approach to this portico, from the Nile,\nwas through an avenue two miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and\nobelisks, twenty, sixty, and a hundred feet in height. The palace itself\n(as well as he could remember) was, in one direction, two miles long,\nand might have been altogether about seven in circuit. Its walls were\nrichly painted all over, within and without, with hieroglyphics. He\nwould not pretend to assert that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor’s\nCapitols might have been built within these walls, but he was by\nno means sure that two or three hundred of them might not have\nbeen squeezed in with some trouble. That palace at Carnac was an\ninsignificant little building after all. He (the Count), however, could\nnot conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity, magnificence, and\nsuperiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as described by the\nDoctor. Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever been seen in\nEgypt or elsewhere.\n\nI here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.\n\n“Nothing,” he replied, “in particular.” They were rather slight, rather\nill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of\ncourse, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which\nthe Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred\nand fifty feet in altitude.\n\nI spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.\n\nHe agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should\nhave gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the\nlittle palace at Carnac.\n\nThis question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea\nof Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon\nwinked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been\nrecently discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the\nGreat Oasis.\n\nI then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and\nasked me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on\nthe obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.\n\nThis disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the\nattack to Metaphysics. We sent for a copy of a book called the “Dial,”\n and read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very\nclear, but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress.\n\nThe Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in\nhis day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but\nit never progressed.\n\nWe then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and\nwere at much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the\nadvantages we enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and\nno king.\n\nHe listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little\namused. When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had\noccurred something of a very similar sort. Thirteen Egyptian provinces\ndetermined all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to\nthe rest of mankind. They assembled their wise men, and concocted the\nmost ingenious constitution it is possible to conceive. For a while they\nmanaged remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious.\nThe thing ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states,\nwith some fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable\ndespotism that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.\n\nI asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.\n\nAs well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.\n\nNot knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the\nEgyptian ignorance of steam.\n\nThe Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. The\nsilent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his\nelbows--told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once--and demanded\nif I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern steam-engine\nis derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de Caus.\n\nWe were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck\nwould have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue,\nand inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the\nmoderns in the all--important particular of dress.\n\nThe Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons,\nand then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up\nclose to his eyes for some minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth\nextended itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember\nthat he said any thing in the way of reply.\n\nHereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy\nwith great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as\na gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the\nmanufacture of either Ponnonner’s lozenges or Brandreth’s pills.\n\nWe looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer--but in vain. It was\nnot forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head. Never was\ntriumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a\ngrace. Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy’s\nmortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave.\n\nUpon getting home I found it past four o’clock, and went immediately\nto bed. It is now ten A.M.

He was mounted on a good strong handsome animal, worth fifty\nguineas if worth a crown.  When they were going up Bissett Hill, Georgy\nmade it his business to overtake the young farmer.  They passed the time\no' day to one another; Georgy spoke of the state of the roads, and jogged\nalongside the well-mounted stranger in very friendly conversation.  The\nfarmer had not been inclined to say much to Georgy at first, but by\ndegrees he grew quite affable too--as friendly as Georgy was toward him.\nHe told Crookhill that he had been doing business at Melchester fair, and\nwas going on as far as Shottsford-Forum that night, so as to reach\nCasterbridge market the next day.  When they came to Woodyates Inn they\nstopped to bait their horses, and agreed to drink together; with this\nthey got more friendly than ever, and on they went again.  Before they\nhad nearly reached Shottsford it came on to rain, and as they were now\npassing through the village of Trantridge, and it was quite dark, Georgy\npersuaded the young farmer to go no further that night; the rain would\nmost likely give them a chill.  For his part he had heard that the little\ninn here was comfortable, and he meant to stay.  At last the young farmer\nagreed to put up there also; and they dismounted, and entered, and had a\ngood supper together, and talked over their affairs like men who had\nknown and proved each other a long time.  When it was the hour for\nretiring they went upstairs to a double-bedded room which Georgy\nCrookhill had asked the landlord to let them share, so sociable were\nthey.\n\n'Before they fell asleep they talked across the room about one thing and\nanother, running from this to that till the conversation turned upon\ndisguises, and changing clothes for particular ends.  The farmer told\nGeorgy that he had often heard tales of people doing it; but Crookhill\nprofessed to be very ignorant of all such tricks; and soon the young\nfarmer sank into slumber.\n\n'Early in the morning, while the tall young farmer was still asleep (I\ntell the story as 'twas told me), honest Georgy crept out of his bed by\nstealth, and dressed himself in the farmer's clothes, in the pockets of\nthe said clothes being the farmer's money.  Now though Georgy\nparticularly wanted the farmer's nice clothes and nice horse, owing to a\nlittle transaction at the fair which made it desirable that he should not\nbe too easily recognized, his desires had their bounds: he did not wish\nto take his young friend's money, at any rate more of it than was\nnecessary for paying his bill.  This he abstracted, and leaving the\nfarmer's purse containing the rest on the bedroom table, went downstairs.\nThe inn folks had not particularly noticed the faces of their customers,\nand the one or two who were up at this hour had no thought but that\nGeorgy was the farmer; so when he had paid the bill very liberally, and\nsaid he must be off, no objection was made to his getting the farmer's\nhorse saddled for himself; and he rode away upon it as if it were his\nown.\n\n'About half an hour after the young farmer awoke, and looking across the\nroom saw that his friend Georgy had gone away in clothes which didn't\nbelong to him, and had kindly left for himself the seedy ones worn by\nGeorgy.  At this he sat up in a deep thought for some time, instead of\nhastening to give an alarm.  \"The money, the money is gone,\" he said to\nhimself, \"and that's bad.  But so are the clothes.\"\n\n'He then looked upon the table and saw that the money, or most of it, had\nbeen left behind.\n\n'\"Ha, ha, ha!\" he cried, and began to dance about the room.  \"Ha, ha,\nha!\" he said again, and made beautiful smiles to himself in the shaving\nglass and in the brass candlestick; and then swung about his arms for all\nthe world as if he were going through the sword exercise.\n\n'When he had dressed himself in Georgy's clothes and gone downstairs, he\ndid not seem to mind at all that they took him for the other; and even\nwhen he saw that he had been left a bad horse for a good one, he was not\ninclined to cry out.  They told him his friend had paid the bill, at\nwhich he seemed much pleased, and without waiting for breakfast he\nmounted Georgy's horse and rode away likewise, choosing the nearest by-\nlane in preference to the high-road, without knowing that Georgy had\nchosen that by-lane also.\n\n'He had not trotted more than two miles in the personal character of\nGeorgy Crookhill when, suddenly rounding a bend that the lane made\nthereabout, he came upon a man struggling in the hands of two village\nconstables.  It was his friend Georgy, the borrower of his clothes and\nhorse.  But so far was the young farmer from showing any alacrity in\nrushing forward to claim his property that he would have turned the poor\nbeast he rode into the wood adjoining, if he had not been already\nperceived.\n\n'\"Help, help, help!\" cried the constables.  \"Assistance in the name of\nthe Crown!\"\n\n'The young farmer could do nothing but ride forward.  \"What's the\nmatter?\" he inquired, as coolly as he could.\n\n'\"A deserter--a deserter!\" said they.  \"One who's to be tried by court-\nmartial and shot without parley.  He deserted from the Dragoons at\nCheltenham some days ago, and was tracked; but the search-party can't\nfind him anywhere, and we told 'em if we met him we'd hand him on to 'em\nforthwith.  The day after he left the barracks the rascal met a\nrespectable farmer and made him drunk at an inn, and told him what a fine\nsoldier he would make, and coaxed him to change clothes, to see how well\na military uniform would become him.  This the simple farmer did; when\nour deserter said that for a joke he would leave the room and go to the\nlandlady, to see if she would know him in that dress.  He never came\nback, and Farmer Jollice found himself in soldier's clothes, the money in\nhis pockets gone, and, when he got to the stable, his horse gone too.\"\n\n'\"A scoundrel!\" says the young man in Georgy's clothes.  \"And is this the\nwretched caitiff?\" (pointing to Georgy).\n\n'\"No, no!\" cries Georgy, as innocent as a babe of this matter of the\nsoldier's desertion.  \"He's the man!  He was wearing Farmer Jollice's\nsuit o' clothes, and he slept in the same room wi' me, and brought up the\nsubject of changing clothes, which put it into my head to dress myself in\nhis suit before he was awake.  He's got on mine!\"\n\n'\"D'ye hear the villain?\" groans the tall young man to the constables.\n\"Trying to get out of his crime by charging the first innocent man with\nit that he sees!  No, master soldier--that won't do!\"\n\n'\"No, no!  That won't do!\" the constables chimed in.  \"To have the\nimpudence to say such as that, when we caught him in the act almost!  But,\nthank God, we've got the handcuffs on him at last.\"\n\n'\"We have, thank God,\" said the tall young man.  \"Well, I must move on.\nGood luck to ye with your prisoner!\"  And off he went, as fast as his\npoor jade would carry him.\n\n'The constables then, with Georgy handcuffed between 'em, and leading the\nhorse, marched off in the other direction, toward the village where they\nhad been accosted by the escort of soldiers sent to bring the deserter\nback, Georgy groaning: \"I shall be shot, I shall be shot!\"  They had not\ngone more than a mile before they met them.\n\n'\"Hoi, there!\" says the head constable.\n\n'\"Hoi, yerself!\" says the corporal in charge.\n\n'\"We've got your man,\" says the constable.\n\n'\"Where?\" says the corporal.\n\n'\"Here, between us,\" said the constable.  \"Only you don't recognize him\nout o' uniform.\"\n\n'The corporal looked at Georgy hard enough; then shook his head and said\nhe was not the absconder.\n\n'\"But the absconder changed clothes with Farmer Jollice, and took his\nhorse; and this man has 'em, d'ye see!\"\n\n'\"'Tis not our man,\" said the soldiers.  \"He's a tall young fellow with a\nmole on his right cheek, and a military bearing, which this man decidedly\nhas not.\"\n\n'\"I told the two officers of justice that 'twas the other!\" pleaded\nGeorgy.  \"But they wouldn't believe me.\"\n\n'And so it became clear that the missing dragoon was the tall young\nfarmer, and not Georgy Crookhill--a fact which Farmer Jollice himself\ncorroborated when he arrived on the scene.  As Georgy had only robbed the\nrobber, his sentence was comparatively light.  The deserter from the\nDragoons was never traced: his double shift of clothing having been of\nthe greatest advantage to him in getting off; though he left Georgy's\nhorse behind him a few miles ahead, having found the poor creature more\nhindrance than aid.'\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe man from abroad seemed to be less interested in the questionable\ncharacters of Longpuddle and their strange adventures than in the\nordinary inhabitants and the ordinary events, though his local fellow-\ntravellers preferred the former as subjects of discussion.  He now for\nthe first time asked concerning young persons of the opposite sex--or\nrather those who had been young when he left his native land.  His\ninformants, adhering to their own opinion that the remarkable was better\nworth telling than the ordinary, would not allow him to dwell upon the\nsimple chronicles of those who had merely come and gone.  They asked him\nif he remembered Netty Sargent.\n\n'Netty Sargent--I do, just remember her.  She was a young woman living\nwith her uncle when I left, if my childish recollection may be trusted.'\n\n'That was the maid.  She was a oneyer, if you like, sir.  Not any harm in\nher, you know, but up to everything.  You ought to hear how she got the\ncopyhold of her house extended.  Oughtn't he, Mr. Day?'\n\n'He ought,' replied the world-ignored old painter.\n\n'Tell him, Mr. Day.  Nobody can do it better than you, and you know the\nlegal part better than some of us.'\n\nDay apologized, and began:--\n\n\n\nNETTY SARGENT'S COPYHOLD\n\n\n'She continued to live with her uncle, in the lonely house by the copse,\njust as at the time you knew her; a tall spry young woman.  Ah, how well\none can remember her black hair and dancing eyes at that time, and her\nsly way of screwing up her mouth when she meant to tease ye!  Well, she\nwas hardly out of short frocks before the chaps were after her, and by\nlong and by late she was courted by a young man whom perhaps you did not\nknow--Jasper Cliff was his name--and, though she might have had many a\nbetter fellow, he so greatly took her fancy that 'twas Jasper or nobody\nfor her.  He was a selfish customer, always thinking less of what he was\ngoing to do than of what he was going to gain by his doings.  Jasper's\neyes might have been fixed upon Netty, but his mind was upon her uncle's\nhouse; though he was fond of her in his way--I admit that.\n\n'This house, built by her great-great-grandfather, with its garden and\nlittle field, was copyhold--granted upon lives in the old way, and had\nbeen so granted for generations.  Her uncle's was the last life upon the\nproperty; so that at his death, if there was no admittance of new lives,\nit would all fall into the hands of the lord of the manor.  But 'twas\neasy to admit--a slight \"fine,\" as 'twas called, of a few pounds, was\nenough to entitle him to a new deed o' grant by the custom of the manor;\nand the lord could not hinder it.\n\n'Now there could be no better provision for his niece and only relative\nthan a sure house over her head, and Netty's uncle should have seen to\nthe renewal in time, owing to the peculiar custom of forfeiture by the\ndropping of the last life before the new fine was paid; for the Squire\nwas very anxious to get hold of the house and land; and every Sunday when\nthe old man came into the church and passed the Squire's pew, the Squire\nwould say, \"A little weaker in his knees, a little crookeder in his\nback--and the readmittance not applied for: ha! ha!  I shall be able to\nmake a complete clearing of that corner of the manor some day!\"\n\n''Twas extraordinary, now we look back upon it, that old Sargent should\nhave been so dilatory; yet some people are like it; and he put off\ncalling at the Squire's agent's office with the fine week after week,\nsaying to himself, \"I shall have more time next market-day than I have\nnow.\"  One unfortunate hindrance was that he didn't very well like Jasper\nCliff; and as Jasper kept urging Netty, and Netty on that account kept\nurging her uncle, the old man was inclined to postpone the re-liveing as\nlong as he could, to spite the selfish young lover.  At last old Mr.\nSargent fell ill, and then Jasper could bear it no longer: he produced\nthe fine-money himself, and handed it to Netty, and spoke to her plainly.\n\n'\"You and your uncle ought to know better.  You should press him more.\nThere's the money.  If you let the house and ground slip between ye, I\nwon't marry; hang me if I will!  For folks won't deserve a husband that\ncan do such things.\"\n\n'The worried girl took the money and went home, and told her uncle that\nit was no house no husband for her.  Old Mr. Sargent pooh-poohed the\nmoney, for the amount was not worth consideration, but he did now bestir\nhimself; for he saw she was bent upon marrying Jasper, and he did not\nwish to make her unhappy, since she was so determined.  It was much to\nthe Squire's annoyance that he found Sargent had moved in the matter at\nlast; but he could not gainsay it, and the documents were prepared (for\non this manor the copy-holders had writings with their holdings, though\non some manors they had none).  Old Sargent being now too feeble to go to\nthe agent's house, the deed was to be brought to his house signed, and\nhanded over as a receipt for the money; the counterpart to be signed by\nSargent, and sent back to the Squire.\n\n'The agent had promised to call on old Sargent for this purpose at five\no'clock, and Netty put the money into her desk to have it close at hand.\nWhile doing this she heard a slight cry from her uncle, and turning\nround, saw that he had fallen forward in his chair.  She went and lifted\nhim, but he was unconscious; and unconscious he remained.  Neither\nmedicine nor stimulants would bring him to himself.  She had been told\nthat he might possibly go off in that way, and it seemed as if the end\nhad come.  Before she had started for a doctor his face and extremities\ngrew quite cold and white, and she saw that help would be useless.  He\nwas stone-dead.\n\n'Netty's situation rose upon her distracted mind in all its seriousness.\nThe house, garden, and field were lost--by a few hours--and with them a\nhome for herself and her lover.  She would not think so meanly of Jasper\nas to suppose that he would adhere to the resolution declared in a moment\nof impatience; but she trembled, nevertheless.  Why could not her uncle\nhave lived a couple of hours longer, since he had lived so long?  It was\nnow past three o'clock; at five the agent was to call, and, if all had\ngone well, by ten minutes past five the house and holding would have been\nsecurely hers for her own and Jasper's lives, these being two of the\nthree proposed to be added by paying the fine.  How that wretched old\nSquire would rejoice at getting the little tenancy into his hands!  He\ndid not really require it, but constitutionally hated these tiny\ncopyholds and leaseholds and freeholds, which made islands of\nindependence in the fair, smooth ocean of his estates.\n\n'Then an idea struck into the head of Netty how to accomplish her object\nin spite of her uncle's negligence.  It was a dull December afternoon:\nand the first step in her scheme--so the story goes, and I see no reason\nto doubt it--'\n\n''Tis true as the light,' affirmed Christopher Twink.  'I was just\npassing by.'\n\n'The first step in her scheme was to fasten the outer door, to make sure\nof not being interrupted.  Then she set to work by placing her uncle's\nsmall, heavy oak table before the fire; then she went to her uncle's\ncorpse, sitting in the chair as he had died--a stuffed arm-chair, on\ncasters, and rather high in the seat, so it was told me--and wheeled the\nchair, uncle and all, to the table, placing him with his back toward the\nwindow, in the attitude of bending over the said oak table, which I knew\nas a boy as well as I know any piece of furniture in my own house.  On\nthe table she laid the large family Bible open before him, and placed his\nforefinger on the page; and then she opened his eyelids a bit, and put on\nhim his spectacles, so that from behind he appeared for all the world as\nif he were reading the Scriptures.  Then she unfastened the door and sat\ndown, and when it grew dark she lit a candle, and put it on the table\nbeside her uncle's book.\n\n'Folk may well guess how the time passed with her till the agent came,\nand how, when his knock sounded upon the door, she nearly started out of\nher skin--at least that's as it was told me.  Netty promptly went to the\ndoor.\n\n'\"I am sorry, sir,\" she says, under her breath; \"my uncle is not so well\nto-night, and I'm afraid he can't see you.\"\n\n'\"H'm!--that's a pretty tale,\" says the steward.  \"So I've come all this\nway about this trumpery little job for nothing!\"\n\n'\"O no, sir--I hope not,\" says Netty.  \"I suppose the business of\ngranting the new deed can be done just the same?\"\n\n'\"Done?  Certainly not.  He must pay the renewal money, and sign the\nparchment in my presence.\"\n\n'She looked dubious.  \"Uncle is so dreadful nervous about law business,\"\nsays she, \"that, as you know, he's put it off and put it off for years;\nand now to-day really I've feared it would verily drive him out of his\nmind.  His poor three teeth quite chattered when I said to him that you\nwould be here soon with the parchment writing.  He always was afraid of\nagents, and folks that come for rent, and such-like.\"\n\n'\"Poor old fellow--I'm sorry for him.  Well, the thing can't be done\nunless I see him and witness his signature.\"\n\n'\"Suppose, sir, that you see him sign, and he don't see you looking at\nhim?  I'd soothe his nerves by saying you weren't strict about the form\nof witnessing, and didn't wish to come in.  So that it was done in your\nbare presence it would be sufficient, would it not?  As he's such an old,\nshrinking, shivering man, it would be a great considerateness on your\npart if that would do?\"\n\n'\"In my bare presence would do, of course--that's all I come for.  But\nhow can I be a witness without his seeing me?\"\n\n'\"Why, in this way, sir; if you'll oblige me by just stepping here.\"  She\nconducted him a few yards to the left, till they were opposite the\nparlour window.  The blind had been left up purposely, and the candle-\nlight shone out upon the garden bushes.  Within the agent could see, at\nthe other end of the room, the back and side of the old man's head, and\nhis shoulders and arm, sitting with the book and candle before him, and\nhis spectacles on his nose, as she had placed him.\n\n'\"He's reading his Bible, as you see, sir,\" she says, quite in her\nmeekest way.\n\n'\"Yes.  I thought he was a careless sort of man in matters of religion?\"\n\n'\"He always was fond of his Bible,\" Netty assured him.  \"Though I think\nhe's nodding over it just at this moment However, that's natural in an\nold man, and unwell.  Now you could stand here and see him sign, couldn't\nyou, sir, as he's such an invalid?\"\n\n'\"Very well,\" said the agent, lighting a cigar.  \"You have ready by you\nthe merely nominal sum you'll have to pay for the admittance, of course?\"\n\n'\"Yes,\" said Netty.  \"I'll bring it out.\"  She fetched the cash, wrapped\nin paper, and handed it to him, and when he had counted it the steward\ntook from his breast pocket the precious parchments and gave one to her\nto be signed.\n\n'\"Uncle's hand is a little paralyzed,\" she said.  \"And what with his\nbeing half asleep, too, really I don't know what sort of a signature\nhe'll be able to make.\"\n\n'\"Doesn't matter, so that he signs.\"\n\n'\"Might I hold his hand?\"\n\n'\"Ay, hold his hand, my young woman--that will be near enough.\"\n\n'Netty re-entered the house, and the agent continued smoking outside the\nwindow.  Now came the ticklish part of Netty's performance.  The steward\nsaw her put the inkhorn--\"horn,\" says I in my old-fashioned way--the\ninkstand, before her uncle, and touch his elbow as to arouse him, and\nspeak to him, and spread out the deed; when she had pointed to show him\nwhere to sign she dipped the pen and put it into his hand.  To hold his\nhand she artfully stepped behind him, so that the agent could only see a\nlittle bit of his head, and the hand she held; but he saw the old man's\nhand trace his name on the document.  As soon as 'twas done she came out\nto the steward with the parchment in her hand, and the steward signed as\nwitness by the light from the parlour window.  Then he gave her the deed\nsigned by the Squire, and left; and next morning Netty told the\nneighbours that her uncle was dead in his bed.'\n\n'She must have undressed him and put him there.'\n\n'She must.  Oh, that girl had a nerve, I can tell ye!  Well, to cut a\nlong story short, that's how she got back the house and field that were,\nstrictly speaking, gone from her; and by getting them, got her a husband.\n\n'Every virtue has its reward, they say.  Netty had hers for her ingenious\ncontrivance to gain Jasper.  Two years after they were married he took to\nbeating her--not hard, you know; just a smack or two, enough to set her\nin a temper, and let out to the neighbours what she had done to win him,\nand how she repented of her pains.  When the old Squire was dead, and his\nson came into the property, this confession of hers began to be whispered\nabout.  But Netty was a pretty young woman, and the Squire's son was a\npretty young man at that time, and wider-minded than his father, having\nno objection to little holdings; and he never took any proceedings\nagainst her.'\n\nThere was now a lull in the discourse, and soon the van descended the\nhill leading into the long straggling village.  When the houses were\nreached the passengers dropped off one by one, each at his or her own\ndoor.  Arrived at the inn, the returned emigrant secured a bed, and\nhaving eaten a light meal, sallied forth upon the scene he had known so\nwell in his early days.  Though flooded with the light of the rising\nmoon, none of the objects wore the attractiveness in this their real\npresentation that had ever accompanied their images in the field of his\nimagination when he was more than two thousand miles removed from them.\nThe peculiar charm attaching to an old village in an old country, as seen\nby the eyes of an absolute foreigner, was lowered in his case by\nmagnified expectations from infantine memories.  He walked on, looking at\nthis chimney and that old wall, till he came to the churchyard, which he\nentered.\n\nThe head-stones, whitened by the moon, were easily decipherable; and now\nfor the first time Lackland began to feel himself amid the village\ncommunity that he had left behind him five-and-thirty years before.  Here,\nbesides the Sallets, the Darths, the Pawles, the Privetts, the Sargents,\nand others of whom he had just heard, were names he remembered even\nbetter than those: the Jickses, and the Crosses, and the Knights, and the\nOlds.  Doubtless representatives of these families, or some of them, were\nyet among the living; but to him they would all be as strangers.  Far\nfrom finding his heart ready-supplied with roots and tendrils here, he\nperceived that in returning to this spot it would be incumbent upon him\nto re-establish himself from the beginning, precisely as though he had\nnever known the place, nor it him.  Time had not condescended to wait his\npleasure, nor local life his greeting.\n\nThe figure of Mr. Lackland was seen at the inn, and in the village\nstreet, and in the fields and lanes about Upper Longpuddle, for a few\ndays after his arrival, and then, ghost-like, it silently disappeared.  He\nhad told some of the villagers that his immediate purpose in coming had\nbeen fulfilled by a sight of the place, and by conversation with its\ninhabitants: but that his ulterior purpose--of coming to spend his latter\ndays among them--would probably never be carried out.  It is now a dozen\nor fifteen years since his visit was paid, and his face has not again\nbeen seen.\n\n","There are places I'll remember\nAll my life, though some have changed\nSome forever, not for better\nSome have gone and some remain\nAll these places have their moments\nWith lovers and friends I still can recall\nSome are dead and some are living\nIn my life, I've loved them all\n\nBut of all these friends and lovers\nThere is no one compares with you\nAnd these memories lose their meaning\nWhen I think of love as something new\nThough I know I'll never lose affection\nFor people and things that went before\nI know I'll often stop and think about them\nIn my life, I love you more\n\nThough I know I'll never lose affection\nFor people and things that went before\nI know I'll often stop and think about them\nIn my life, I love you more\n\n","Loving you isn't the right thing to do.\nHow can I ever change things that I feel.\n\nIf I could, maybe I'd give you my world.\nHow can I, when you won't take it from me.\n\nYou can go your own way.\nGo your own way.\nYou can call it another lonely day.\nYou can go your own way.\n\nTell me why everything turned around.\nPacking up, shacking up is all you want to do.\n\nIf I could, baby I'd give you my world.\nOpen up, everything's waiting for you.\n\n","Thank you very much.

But nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter, Nancy, presiding tonight as Speaker of the House of Representatives. Congratulations, Madam Speaker.\nTwo members of the House and Senate are not with us tonight, and we pray for the recovery and speedy return of Senator Tim Johnson and Congressman Charlie Norwood.\nMadam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:\nThe rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour — when decisions are hard and courage is needed. We enter the year 2007 with large endeavors underway, and others that are ours to begin. In all of this, much is asked of us. We must have the will to face difficult challenges and determined enemies — and the wisdom to face them together.\nSome in this chamber are new to the House and the Senate — and I congratulate the Democrat majority. Congress has changed, but not our responsibilities. Each of us is guided by our own convictions — and to these we must stay faithful. Yet we're all held to the same standards, and called to serve the same good purposes: To extend this nation's prosperity; to spend the people's money wisely; to solve problems, not leave them to future generations; to guard America against all evil; and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us.\nWe're not the first to come here with a government divided and uncertainty in the air. Like many before us, we can work through our differences, and achieve big things for the American people. Our citizens don't much care which side of the aisle we sit on — as long as we're willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done. Our job is to make life better for our fellow Americans, and to help them to build a future of hope and opportunity — and this is the business before us tonight.\nA future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy — and that is what we have. We're now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth, in a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs — so far. Unemployment is low, inflation is low, and wages are rising. This economy is on the move, and our job is to keep it that way, not with more government, but with more enterprise.\nNext week, I'll deliver a full report on the state of our economy. Tonight, I want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this Congress.\nFirst, we must balance the federal budget. We can do so without raising taxes. What we need is impose spending discipline in Washington, D.C. We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009, and met that goal three years ahead of schedule. Now let us take the next step. In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within the next five years. I ask you to make the same commitment. Together, we can restrain the spending appetite of the federal government, and we can balance the federal budget.\nNext, there is the matter of earmarks. These special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour — when not even C-SPAN is watching. In 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion. Even worse, over 90 percent of earmarks never make it to the floor of the House and Senate — they are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk. You didn't vote them into law. I didn't sign them into law. Yet, they're treated as if they have the force of law. The time has come to end this practice. So let us work together to reform the budget process, expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in Congress, and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of this session.\nAnd, finally, to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of entitlements. Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments of conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound. Yet, we're failing in that duty. And this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cuts in benefits. Everyone in this chamber knows this to be true — yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act. So let us work together and do it now. With enough good sense and goodwill, you and I can fix Medicare and Medicaid — and save Social Security.\nSpreading opportunity and hope in America also requires public schools that give children the knowledge and character they need in life. Five years ago, we rose above partisan differences to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, preserving local control, raising standards, and holding those schools accountable for results. And because we acted, students are performing better in reading and math, and minority students are closing the achievement gap.\nNow the task is to build on the success, without watering down standards, without taking control from local communities, and without backsliding and calling it reform. We can lift student achievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools, and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better. We must increase funds for students who struggle — and make sure these children get the special help they need. And we can make sure our children are prepared for the jobs of the future and our country is more competitive by strengthening math and science skills. The No Child Left Behind Act has worked for America's children — and I ask Congress to reauthorize this good law.\nA future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and available health care. When it comes to health care, government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, and poor children. And we will meet those responsibilities. For all other Americans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs. But many Americans cannot afford a health insurance policy.\nAnd so tonight, I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans afford their own insurance. First, I propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents. Families with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax — or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income. Single Americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of their income. With this reform, more than 100 million men, women, and children who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills. At the same time, this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health insurance through their job. For Americans who now purchase health insurance on their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings — $4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a year. And for the millions of other Americans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic private health insurance plan within their reach. Changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans.\nMy second proposal is to help the states that are coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured. States that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick. I have asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with Congress to take existing federal funds and use them to create \"Affordable Choices\" grants. These grants would give our nation's governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to those most in need.\nThere are many other ways that Congress can help. We need to expand Health Savings Accounts. We need to help small businesses through Association Health Plans. We need to reduce costs and medical errors with better information technology. We will encourage price transparency. And to protect good doctors from junk lawsuits, we passing medical liability reform. In all we do, we must remember that the best health care decisions are made not by government and insurance companies, but by patients and their doctors.\nExtending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system worthy of America — with laws that are fair and borders that are secure. When laws and borders are routinely violated, this harms the interests of our country. To secure our border, we're doubling the size of the Border Patrol, and funding new infrastructure and technology.\nYet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border — and that requires a temporary worker program. We should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis. As a result, they won't have to try to sneak in, and that will leave Border Agents free to chase down drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists. We'll enforce our immigration laws at the work site and give employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers, so there's no excuse left for violating the law.\nWe need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals. We need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty. Convictions run deep in this Capitol when it comes to immigration. Let us have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so that you can pass, and I can sign, comprehensive immigration reform into law.\nExtending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps America's economy running and America's environment clean. For too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil. And this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes, and to terrorists — who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments, and raise the price of oil, and do great harm to our economy.\nIt's in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply — the way forward is through technology. We must continue changing the way America generates electric power, by even greater use of clean coal technology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power. We need to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles, and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel. We must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol using everything from wood chips to grasses, to agricultural wastes.\nWe made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in Washington and the strong response of the market. And now even more dramatic advances are within reach. Tonight, I ask Congress to join me in pursuing a great goal. Let us build on the work we've done and reduce gasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years. When we do that we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we now import from the Middle East.\nTo reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017 — and that is nearly five times the current target. At the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks — and conserve up to 8.5 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017.\nAchieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but it's not going to eliminate it. And so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply, we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways. And to further protect America against severe disruptions to our oil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\nAmerica is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil. And these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment, and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change.\nA future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of justice. The lives of our citizens across our nation are affected by the outcome of cases pending in our federal courts. We have a shared obligation to ensure that the federal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timely rulings. As President, I have a duty to nominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the federal bench. And the United States Senate has a duty, as well, to give those nominees a fair hearing, and a prompt up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.\nFor all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger. Five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause. We've had time to take stock of our situation. We've added many critical protections to guard the homeland. We know with certainty that the horrors of that September morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us — unless we stop them.\nWith the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed. Such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions. Yet one question has surely been settled: that to win the war on terror we must take the fight to the enemy.\nFrom the start, America and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense. The enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary, easy movement, steady financing, and free flowing communications are long over. For the terrorists, life since 9/11 has never been the same.\nOur success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen. We cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented, but here is some of what we do know: We stopped an al Qaeda plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the West Coast. We broke up a Southeast Asian terror cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the United States. We uncovered an al Qaeda cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against America. And just last August, British authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean. For each life saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them.\nEvery success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy. The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world. And so long as that's the case, America is still a nation at war.\nIn the mind of the terrorist, this war began well before September the 11th, and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled. And these past five years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy. Al Qaeda and its followers are Sunni extremists, possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology. Take almost any principle of civilization, and their goal is the opposite. They preach with threats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent.\nOur enemies are quite explicit about their intentions. They want to overthrow moderate governments, and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country. By killing and terrorizing Americans, they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty. They would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology. Listen to this warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: \"We will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is even worse.\" Osama bin Laden declared: \"Death is better than living on this Earth with the unbelievers among us.\"\nThese men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in the Islamist radical movement. In recent times, it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from Shia extremists who are just as hostile to America, and are also determined to dominate the Middle East. Many are known to take direction from the regime in Iran, which is funding and arming terrorists like Hezbollah — a group second only to al Qaeda in the American lives it has taken.\nThe Shia and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat. Whatever slogans they chant, when they slaughter the innocent they have the same wicked purposes. They want to kill Americans, kill democracy in the Middle East, and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale.\nIn the sixth year since our nation was attacked, I wish I could report to you that the dangers had ended. They have not. And so it remains the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do our duty, to find these enemies, and to protect the American people.\nThis war is more than a clash of arms — it is a decisive ideological struggle, and the security of our nation is in the balance. To prevail, we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred, and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us. What every terrorist fears most is human freedom\n— societies where men and women make their own choices, answer to their own conscience, and live by their hopes instead of their resentments. Free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies — and most will choose a better way when they're given a chance. So we advance our own security interests by helping moderates and reformers and brave voices for democracy. The great question of our day is whether America will help men and women in the Middle East to build free societies and share in the rights of all humanity. And I say, for the sake of our own security, we must.\nIn the last two years, we've seen the desire for liberty in the broader Middle East — and we have been sobered by the enemy's fierce reaction. In 2005, the world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised the banner of the Cedar Revolution, they drove out the Syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections. In 2005, the people of Afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature. And in 2005, the Iraqi people held three national elections, choosing a transitional government, adopting the most progressive, democratic constitution in the Arab world, and then electing a government under that constitution. Despite endless threats from the killers in their midst, nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget.\nA thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, and in 2006 they struck back. In Lebanon, assassins took the life of Pierre Gemayel, a prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution. Hezbollah terrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to undermine Lebanon's legitimately elected government. In Afghanistan, Taliban and al Qaeda fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging Afghan and NATO forces. In Iraq, al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in Shia Islam — the Golden Mosque of Samarra. This atrocity, directed at a Muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke retaliation from Iraqi Shia — and it succeeded. Radical Shia elements, some of whom receive support from Iran, formed death squads. The result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day.\nThis is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we're in. Every one of us wishes this war were over and won. Yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and our own security at risk. Ladies and gentlemen: On this day, at this hour, it is still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle. Let us find our resolve, and turn events toward victory.\nWe're carrying out a new strategy in Iraq — a plan that demands more from Iraq's elected government, and gives our forces in Iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission. Our goal is a democratic Iraq that upholds the rule of law, respects the rights of its people, provides them security, and is an ally in the war on terror.\nIn order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital. But the Iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own. So we're deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq. The vast majority will go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods, and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army units. With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads. And in Anbar Province, where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we're sending an additional 4,000 United States Marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out. We didn't drive al Qaeda out of their safe haven in Afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in a free Iraq.\nThe people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now it's time for their government to act. Iraq's leaders know that our commitment is not open-ended. They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure Baghdad — and they must do so. They pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction or political party — and they need to follow through, and lift needless restrictions on Iraqi and coalition forces, so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of Baghdad. Iraq's leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks — to achieve reconciliation, to share oil revenues among all of Iraq's citizens, to put the wealth of Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow more Iraqis to re-enter their nation's civic life, to hold local elections, and to take responsibility for security in every Iraqi province. But for all of this to happen, Baghdad must be secure. And our plan will help the Iraqi government take back its capital and make good on its commitments.\nMy fellow citizens, our military commanders and I have carefully weighed the options. We discussed every possible approach. In the end, I chose this course of action because it provides the best chance for success. Many in this chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq, because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far-reaching.\nIf American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides. We could expect an epic battle between Shia extremists backed by Iran, and Sunni extremists aided by al Qaeda and supporters of the old regime. A contagion of violence could spill out across the country — and in time, the entire region could be drawn into the conflict.\nFor America, this is a nightmare scenario. For the enemy, this is the objective. Chaos is the greatest ally — their greatest ally in this struggle. And out of chaos in Iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens, new recruits, new resources, and an even greater determination to harm America. To allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and invite tragedy. Ladies and gentlemen, nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for America to succeed in the Middle East, to succeed in Iraq and to spare the American people from this danger.\nThis is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now. I have spoken with many of you in person. I respect you and the arguments you've made. We went into this largely united, in our assumptions and in our convictions. And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure. Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a chance to work. And I ask you to support our troops in the field, and those on their way.\nThe war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and I have turned our duties over to others. And that's why it's important to work together so our nation can see this great effort through. Both parties and both branches should work in close consultation. It's why I propose to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror, made up of leaders in Congress from both political parties. We will share ideas for how to position America to meet every challenge that confronts us. We'll show our enemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory.\nAnd one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military so that the American Armed Forces are ready for all the challenges ahead. Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the next five years. A second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteer Civilian Reserve Corps. Such a corps would function much like our military reserve. It would ease the burden on the Armed Forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when America needs them. It would give people across America who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time.\nAmericans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because we're not in this struggle alone. We have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against extremism. In Iraq, multinational forces are operating under a mandate from the United Nations. We're working with Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and the Gulf States to increase support for Iraq's government.\nThe United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran, and made it clear that the world will not allow the regime in Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons. With the other members of the Quartet — the U.N., the European Union, and Russia — we're pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the Holy Land, and pursuing the establishment of a democratic Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel in peace and security. In Afghanistan, NATO has taken the lead in turning back the Taliban and al Qaeda offensive — the first time the Alliance has deployed forces outside the North Atlantic area. Together with our partners in China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea, we're pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons.\nWe will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like Cuba, Belarus, and Burma [1] — and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of Darfur.\nAmerican foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy. Our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To whom much is given, much is required. We hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty and disease — and that is precisely what America is doing. We must continue to fight HIV/AIDS, especially on the continent of Africa. Because you funded our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the number of people receiving life-saving drugs has grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in three short years. I ask you to continue funding our efforts to fight HIV/AIDS. I ask you to provide $1.2 billion over five years so we can combat malaria in 15 African countries.\nI ask that you fund the Millennium Challenge Account, so that American aid reaches the people who need it, in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption is in retreat. And let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope for lifting lives and eliminating poverty.\nWhen America serves others in this way, we show the strength and generosity of our country. These deeds reflect the character of our people. The greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness, courage, and self-sacrifice of the American people. You see this spirit often if you know where to look — and tonight we need only look above to the gallery.\nDikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa, amid great poverty and disease. He came to Georgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine — but Coach John Thompson got a look at Dikembe and had a different idea. Dikembe became a star in the NBA, and a citizen of the United States. But he never forgot the land of his birth, or the duty to share his blessings with others. He built a brand new hospital in his old hometown. A friend has said of this good-hearted man: \"Mutombo believes that God has given him this opportunity to do great things.\" And we are proud to call this son of the Congo [2] a citizen of the United States of America.\nAfter her daughter was born, Julie Aigner-Clark searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child. So she borrowed some equipment, and began filming children's videos in her basement. The Baby Einstein Company was born, and in just five years her business grew to more than $20 million in sales. In November 2001, Julie sold Baby Einstein to the Walt Disney Company, and with her help Baby Einstein has grown into a $200 million business. Julie represents the great enterprising spirit of America. And she is using her success to help others — producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Julie says of her new project: \"I believe it's the most important thing that I have ever done. I believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe.\" And so tonight, we are pleased to welcome this talented business entrepreneur and generous social entrepreneur — Julie Aigner-Clark.\nThree weeks ago, Wesley Autrey was waiting at a Harlem subway station with his two little girls, when he saw a man fall into the path of a train. With seconds to act, Wesley jumped onto the tracks, pulled the man into the space between the rails, and held him as the train passed right above their heads. He insists he's not a hero. He says: \"We got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms. We have got to show each other some love.\" There is something wonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man like Wesley Autrey.\nTommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in Independence, Kentucky, when he enlisted in the United States Army. In December 2003, he was on a reconnaissance mission in Iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire. From his Humvee, Sergeant Rieman returned fire; he used his body as a shield to protect his gunner. He was shot in the chest and arm, and received shrapnel wounds to his legs — yet he refused medical attention, and stayed in the fight. He helped to repel a second attack, firing grenades at the enemy's position. For his exceptional courage, Sergeant Rieman was awarded the Silver Star. And like so many other Americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the respect and the gratitude of our entire country.\nIn such courage and compassion, ladies and gentlemen, we see the spirit and character of America — and these qualities are not in short supply. This is a decent and honorable country — and resilient, too. We've been through a lot together. We've met challenges and faced dangers, and we know that more lie ahead. Yet we can go forward with confidence — because the State of our Union is strong, our cause in the world is right, and tonight that cause goes on. God bless.\nSee you next year. Thank you for your prayers.\n","\nWell, I have received much encouragement to relate my experiences on Ecstasy, so here is an attempt...\n\nI was told almost a week in advance that I might have the opportunity to try Ecstasy with the young lady who acted as a guide for my first LSD trip. We were to meet at a given tube station not far from the nightclub where the experimentation would take place.\n\nI was not easy about trying a new psychedelic in a crowded place, realizing this could have been difficult to handle with LSD. But there lay the opportunity and I just hoped to have enough mental control (practice of Yoga helping) if things got tight.\n\nI had read about MDMA in Peter Stafford's Psychedelics Encyclopaedia, but was aware E's are not very often pure MDMA. In addition, the book had stayed at home and my memory of its contents had faded somewhat. So I scanned the net for an Ecstasy FAQ and read that, also reading whatever current reports of the experience were posted on alt.drugs.\n\nQuite strangely, that was also the week my father decided to give me a hysterical account of some absurd and manipulatively badly written article in a Swiss newspaper depicting the dreadful and possessive evils of the Love Pill. He knows I have profound interest in altered consciousness and its chemical gateways, but not what I'm up to in my spare time...\n\nAnyway, I psyched myself up all week for the event, and when the Saturday evening came, I left a little note on my desk explaining that if I was unlucky that night, the Quest had been worth it.\n\nAs soon as we entered the nightclub, we went upstairs to the dance floor. An immense room with drapes hanging off all walls, a screen with a permanent slide of Planet Earth on it and countless balloons floating all around.\n\nSitting in a corner of the stage, I was handed my 2/3 of a White Dove pill. I insisted on chewing it to taste it - I wanted some intimate contact with the substance I was about to share my mind with. Tasted awful. Very chemical. That made me laugh, especially looking at the face of my companion who had agreed to bite into it too. We washed the taste down with gulps from the traditional raver's water bottle, as our supplier explained to us a few of the basics and possible initial effects.\n\n'If you feel funny, get up and dance.' she had said.\n\nSure enough, about 25 minutes later, I was feeling slightly uncomfortable. Stomach ? Mind ? I wasn't sure. From feeling quite talkative I went to being rather silent and reserved. So I got up and began to jiggle about. That felt a whole lot better.\n\nI was soon joined by the other Ecstasy-newbie who commented that nothing was happening to her.\n\n'I feel weird', I said.\n\n'Keep dancing' our supplier repeated, she too waiting for her E to kick in.\n\nMinutes later I experienced a rush to the head - I felt for a few seconds that I was really going to lose it, and had a vision of myself huddled in a corner, crying for hours. Damn, just my luck I thought, a bad trip on the first one. I literally felt as if my mind was going to black out. No way, I thought, no way. My dad talks WOsD propaganda and I'm not having a bad trip. I quickly searched for my companions on the stage and got closer to them. I danced more energetically, trying to get into the music.\n\nSeconds later a most unbelievable surge of energy and gentle warmth rushed through my body. It was so brutally intense, all I could do for several minutes was inhale and let the breath come out as one long howl of indescriptible joy. Many around me joined in. It seemed as though half the stage was just hollering in joint ecstasy.\n\nEcstasy. The perfect word. No other could have described what I was experiencing right then and there. Beyond words. The entire message was contained in a scream and the most intense smile my face had displayed in ages.\n\nOur supplier bounded up to us asking 'are you OK ? Have you eased up both of you ? You were rather tense'. I just grinned my face off.\n\n'I feel like hugging everybody' I shouted.\n\n'Then DO !' she yelled, flinging herself around my neck. Geez, that felt so GOOD ! Hugging was the most rewarding, comforting and uplifting experience ! This, for a person such as myself, usually quite conscious of personal space and physical contact with strangers, was a truly fascinating discovery.\n\nThe music too was surrounding me in trance-like comfort. The sound spoke to every nerve in my body. This is the synergy between dance, mind and rythmic signatures Terrence McKenna was on about, I thought. Wow. I could enjoy the 'Here and Now' - any time a thought of something unpleasant from the world would arise, I could look at it without stress, then gently push it out of my mind. It didn't matter that I had a project and exams. This state was pure, free, uninhibited.\n\nSpeaking to people in the chill-out room was bliss. I wanted everybody to be OK, I wanted to know their names, how many times they came here, what they were on... They were all so friendly.\n\nOne of them asked me 'You're all loved up, right ?'. I answered with the ecstatic grin. 'It's their first E' he was told. He then got up, opened his arms wide, and gave me a big hug. There was something so pure and brotherly about the whole atmosphere, it was overwhelming.\n\nI noticed all the described effects : brighter lights and colours, increased physical energy yet great calm, strong empathy and forgiveness for agressive behaviour, merging with the music to a trance state...\n\n'Beware of inappropriate emotional bonding', I had read. Damn, that's what held me back from interacting more fully with an unusually pretty girl who seemed to want to dance with me. As I noticed she was looking into my eyes and half turning to face me, I felt my heartbeat pound away. Another amazing wave of warmth shot up through my stomach to the top of my head. I felt my entire body vibrating with pleasure. I was on E and I was being turned on.\n\nI just looked into her eyes. I was confused by the intensity of the attraction, and uncertain how much of this was real. I needed a nod from a friend to go ahead, or something like that.\n\nThe nod never came. But I learned something really valuable there. Several years ago I got screwed up by a strong bondage with a girl. She moved away, and sure enough some predator attracted by her beauty seduced her. Though she chucked him away fast, that was the end for us. I had never been able to start another relationship with a girl since. I would miss any cue girls would send out to me, or even turn away from them, frightened. That Saturday night, Ecstasy cleared me from this emotional hangup. On the way down, I became introspective and meditative, and figured out what had been inhibiting me from falling in love again. This made me feel a great weight had just left my conscience, and I shared this feeling with friends immediately. I was once more free to love.\n\nSounds dramatic, I know. But this realization was deep, complete and liberating. LSD had freed my mind from some of its shackles, Ecstasy was freeing my feelings.\n\nThere would be so much more to say. But if you've read this far, I won't abuse your patience.\n\nWhat remains from the first experience is this emotional freedom, this feeling for Compassion (I now have a much better notion of what Buddha or Christ seemed to be preaching), and an increased ability to tune in to the structures and messages of music. On a more subtle level, I find it easier to initiate conversation with people and can cope better with aimless talk about this or that. I can also pick out almost anybody in a nightclub who is on E ! A real sharing and compassionate bunch - if a complete stranger happily offers you water, a spliff or a Vicks inhaler, I give you one guess as to what he's swallowed. Check the intense smile on his face, too.\n\nI have had only two more experiences with Ecstasy since.\n\nOn one occasion I met a really interesting group on the dance floor, winding up back at their place smoking spliff and playing video games, with a good bed for the night ! It also confirmed the return of my ability to interact with girls without hangups.\n\nOn the second occasion, I had twenty minutes of deeply mystical feeling ('I feel I'm talking to Jesus' I told my friend - this being from an agnostic). I also had a blinding moment in which I felt intensely how deeply important my friends are to me and how far beyond ordinary bonds our friendship goes.\n\nSo for whoever is going to try Ecstasy : aside from the usual drink-lots-of-water-and-wear-loose-clothing advice, prepare for times of howling beauty and buzzing interactions. Remember you can look at personal problems in a warm detached manner and maybe solve emotional history problems. And prepare for the ultimate experiences in dancing. \n\n","\n'William, as you may know, was a curious, silent man; you could feel when\nhe came near 'ee; and if he was in the house or anywhere behind your back\nwithout your seeing him, there seemed to be something clammy in the air,\nas if a cellar door was opened close by your elbow.  Well, one Sunday, at\na time that William was in very good health to all appearance, the bell\nthat was ringing for church went very heavy all of a sudden; the sexton,\nwho told me o't, said he'd not known the bell go so heavy in his hand for\nyears--it was just as if the gudgeons wanted oiling.  That was on the\nSunday, as I say.  During the week after, it chanced that William's wife\nwas staying up late one night to finish her ironing, she doing the\nwashing for Mr. and Mrs. Hardcome.  Her husband had finished his supper\nand gone to bed as usual some hour or two before.  While she ironed she\nheard him coming down stairs; he stopped to put on his boots at the stair-\nfoot, where he always left them, and then came on into the living-room\nwhere she was ironing, passing through it towards the door, this being\nthe only way from the staircase to the outside of the house.  No word was\nsaid on either side, William not being a man given to much speaking, and\nhis wife being occupied with her work.  He went out and closed the door\nbehind him.  As her husband had now and then gone out in this way at\nnight before when unwell, or unable to sleep for want of a pipe, she took\nno particular notice, and continued at her ironing.  This she finished\nshortly after, and as he had not come in she waited awhile for him,\nputting away the irons and things, and preparing the table for his\nbreakfast in the morning.  Still he did not return, but supposing him not\nfar off, and wanting to get to bed herself, tired as she was, she left\nthe door unbarred and went to the stairs, after writing on the back of\nthe door with chalk: _Mind and do the door_ (because he was a forgetful\nman).\n\n'To her great surprise, and I might say alarm, on reaching the foot of\nthe stairs his boots were standing there as they always stood when he had\ngone to rest; going up to their chamber she found him in bed sleeping as\nsound as a rock.  How he could have got back again without her seeing or\nhearing him was beyond her comprehension.  It could only have been by\npassing behind her very quietly while she was bumping with the iron.  But\nthis notion did not satisfy her: it was surely impossible that she should\nnot have seen him come in through a room so small.  She could not unravel\nthe mystery, and felt very queer and uncomfortable about it.  However,\nshe would not disturb him to question him then, and went to bed herself.\n\n'He rose and left for his work very early the next morning, before she\nwas awake, and she waited his return to breakfast with much anxiety for\nan explanation, for thinking over the matter by daylight made it seem\nonly the more startling.  When he came in to the meal he said, before she\ncould put her question, \"What's the meaning of them words chalked on the\ndoor?\"\n\n'She told him, and asked him about his going out the night before.\nWilliam declared that he had never left the bedroom after entering it,\nhaving in fact undressed, lain down, and fallen asleep directly, never\nonce waking till the clock struck five, and he rose up to go to his\nlabour.\n\n'Betty Privett was as certain in her own mind that he did go out as she\nwas of her own existence, and was little less certain that he did not\nreturn.  She felt too disturbed to argue with him, and let the subject\ndrop as though she must have been mistaken.  When she was walking down\nLongpuddle street later in the day she met Jim Weedle's daughter Nancy,\nand said, \"Well, Nancy, you do look sleepy to-day!\"\n\n'\"Yes, Mrs. Privett,\" says Nancy.  \"Now don't tell anybody, but I don't\nmind letting you know what the reason o't is.  Last night, being Old\nMidsummer Eve, some of us went to church porch, and didn't get home till\nnear one.\"\n\n'\"Did ye?\" says Mrs. Privett.  \"Old Midsummer yesterday was it?  Faith I\ndidn't think whe'r 'twas Midsummer or Michaelmas; I'd too much work to\ndo.\"\n\n'\"Yes.  And we were frightened enough, I can tell 'ee, by what we saw.\"\n\n'\"What did ye see?\"\n\n'(You may not remember, sir, having gone off to foreign parts so young,\nthat on Midsummer Night it is believed hereabout that the faint shapes of\nall the folk in the parish who are going to be at death's door within the\nyear can be seen entering the church.  Those who get over their illness\ncome out again after a while; those that are doomed to die do not\nreturn.)\n\n'\"What did you see?\" asked William's wife.\n\n'\"Well,\" says Nancy, backwardly--\"we needn't tell what we saw, or who we\nsaw.\"\n\n'\"You saw my husband,\" says Betty Privett, in a quiet way.\n\n'\"Well, since you put it so,\" says Nancy, hanging fire, \"we--thought we\ndid see him; but it was darkish, and we was frightened, and of course it\nmight not have been he.\"\n\n'\"Nancy, you needn't mind letting it out, though 'tis kept back in\nkindness.  And he didn't come out of church again: I know it as well as\nyou.\"\n\n'Nancy did not answer yes or no to that, and no more was said.  But three\ndays after, William Privett was mowing with John Chiles in Mr. Hardcome's\nmeadow, and in the heat of the day they sat down to eat their bit o'\nnunch under a tree, and empty their flagon.  Afterwards both of 'em fell\nasleep as they sat.  John Chiles was the first to wake, and as he looked\ntowards his fellow-mower he saw one of those great white miller's-souls\nas we call 'em--that is to say, a miller-moth--come from William's open\nmouth while he slept, and fly straight away.  John thought it odd enough,\nas William had worked in a mill for several years when he was a boy.  He\nthen looked at the sun, and found by the place o't that they had slept a\nlong while, and as William did not wake, John called to him and said it\nwas high time to begin work again.  He took no notice, and then John went\nup and shook him, and found he was dead.\n\n'Now on that very day old Philip Hookhorn was down at Longpuddle Spring\ndipping up a pitcher of water; and as he turned away, who should he see\ncoming down to the spring on the other side but William, looking very\npale and odd.  This surprised Philip Hookhorn very much, for years before\nthat time William's little son--his only child--had been drowned in that\nspring while at play there, and this had so preyed upon William's mind\nthat he'd never been seen near the spring afterwards, and had been known\nto go half a mile out of his way to avoid the place.  On inquiry, it was\nfound that William in body could not have stood by the spring, being in\nthe mead two miles off; and it also came out that the time at which he\nwas seen at the spring was the very time when he died.'\n\n* * * * *\n\n'A rather melancholy story,' observed the emigrant, after a minute's\nsilence.\n\n'Yes, yes.  Well, we must take ups and downs together,' said the\nseedsman's father.\n\n'You don't know, Mr. Lackland, I suppose, what a rum start that was\nbetween Andrey Satchel and Jane Vallens and the pa'son and clerk o'\nScrimpton?' said the master-thatcher, a man with a spark of subdued\nliveliness in his eye, who had hitherto kept his attention mainly upon\nsmall objects a long way ahead, as he sat in front of the van with his\nfeet outside.  'Theirs was a queerer experience of a pa'son and clerk\nthan some folks get, and may cheer 'ee up a little after this dampness\nthat's been flung over yer soul.'\n\nThe returned one replied that he knew nothing of the history, and should\nbe happy to hear it, quite recollecting the personality of the man\nSatchel.\n\n'Ah no; this Andrey Satchel is the son of the Satchel that you knew; this\none has not been married more than two or three years, and 'twas at the\ntime o' the wedding that the accident happened that I could tell 'ee of,\nor anybody else here, for that matter.'\n\n'No, no; you must tell it, neighbour, if anybody,' said several; a\nrequest in which Mr. Lackland joined, adding that the Satchel family was\none he had known well before leaving home.\n\n'I'll just mention, as you be a stranger,' whispered the carrier to\nLackland, 'that Christopher's stories will bear pruning.'\n\nThe emigrant nodded.\n\n'Well, I can soon tell it,' said the master-thatcher, schooling himself\nto a tone of actuality.  'Though as it has more to do with the pa'son and\nclerk than with Andrey himself, it ought to be told by a better churchman\nthan I.'\n\n","Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down.\nand I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air.\n\nIn west Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground was where I spent most of my days.\nChillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool, and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school.\nWhen a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood,\nI got in one little fight and my mom got scared, she said, \"You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air\".\n\nI begged and pleaded with her day after day but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way.\nShe gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.

We had just gotten out of school so we figured hey, lets get some acid. We'd both done shrooms a couple of times before but that was it for hallucinogens.\n\n7:30AM - we had only gotten a couple of hours of sleep the night before (anticipation) and decided we'd go to the local waffle house for a nice breakfast of Acid and water :) We put the fat blue-stained tabs on our tongues on the way and got our semi-retarded but sober friend to drive us there. Our first indications of anything different were probably about an hour after the drop at the waffle house. With the tabs still on our tongues, we decided to swallow them with water at our table. My friend looked down at a spoon that was next to me and said 'Oh fuck' because my face was starting to 'transform'. I didn't notice any change until we got up to leave, when suddenly I felt really unnaturally tall. The ground was kind of slanted and colors took on a brighter, more vivid effect.\n\nThen it happened. As we got into the car, we went into neverland. All of a sudden it had the effect of a mild mushroom trip and we decided to head for my friend's house because his parents were out. By the time we arrived, it was really starting to hit. Nothing freaked us out at this point even though neither of us had experienced as intense a thing as this before. Once inside, the hallucinations started happening. My first one I'll never forget was lookin at a statue on the mantle and watching it transform into a serpant and slither around. My friend started talkin to the horse head picture on the wall - he said it was pokin out and talking to him. Every aspect of the room seemed to be alive and in its own universe.\n\nOur other friend/sitter decided to go out on the porch and smoke a joint while we continued trippin our balls off. Next stage of the trip, the bathroom. I walked in to take a piss and before I was able to turn on the lights, I had the most intense, realistic hallucinations of people and character's faces coming at me through the darkness. I yelled at my friend to get in there and he saw igniting sparks flying around his head. While our friend was blazing outside we went into the basement to attempt to play pool. HAHAHA. Right. We ended up hunting giraffes on a safari thinkin the pool cue's were spears. Our other sober friend came downstairs and I tried talking to him but I kept seeing things manifest from his face, mainly banana-stalks and images of fruit.\n\nMy trippin friend had left the room to go watch his countertop 'breathe' so I took the opportunity to stick my head into the freezer. Man the images I saw, I can't even describe it. Eventually all 4 of us wound up upstairs and then all hell broke loose. Our beautiful experience was about to turn into a hellish nightmare by the call of one person, my friend's dad. Apparently his dad chose this day of all days to hound his ass on the phone about him not coming home the night before and fully expecting him to be home in a couple of hours. Now we were in trouble - we had planned to stay the entire trip at his house and we had to leave. As if it weren't enough, our friends both bailed on us and so there we were, 2 acid heads outside watching our friends drive away and trying to figure out what to do with poolsticks in our hands.\n\nAfter an eternity of panic (2 real minutes) I called my other friend and told him our situation. We convinced him to drive down and babysit us, so again we were good for about another hour until my friend's dad started calling again. No way could he have talked to him on the phone, we were so far gone from reality at this point that nothing, not even 4 word text messages made sense to us. So began our grand journey. We got our friend to drive us to the local park so we could walk around. We were so fucked up that our only goal was to kill time until we could come down to reality and face society again.\n\nAs soon as we were on the walking/bike path, we noticed our first heavy tracers when bikers would go by and their doubles would keep passing us for another 2 minutes. The jungle had never looked so alive. Everything was moving and breathing, and I think this is where sounds started to mesh with sight and taste. I remember 'tasting' the green of the leaves and hearing the trails of the bikers. Well that lasted about 5 minutes real time (3 hours ours) so we told our friend to drive us anywhere else, which ended up being another park. When we stopped in the parking lot we met another friend who freaked us the fuck out. He kept saying he had a friend who was a sheriff and he was gonna get us arrested and into a drug program.\n\nSo then all of us went to this pizza joint and ordered a large pepperoni. My friend's distorted image of the waitress was beyond ridiculous, he said 'When she put the pizza on the table her face went with it and landed in the middle of the cheese.' By now people's faces were melting and shape-shifting, it was nearly impossible to talk to people, or so we thought, apparently we sounded fine the whole time but we sure as hell didn't feel like we did. There was pizza in front of us and we just couldn't eat - just too fucked up, so its about hour 5 or 6 with no food. Next we, in our brilliancy, decided it would be smart to try to go to a movie just to pass the time. This was the dumbest thing we've ever done. On the way to the theater we happened to see a live car accident as it happened (confirmed by our sober friends), and as if that weren't enough all the times and titles on the theater listings were backwards in real life, which just made us feel more crazier.\n\nBy now we started to get worried that the trip wouldn't end - that's where the panic started. When we walked into the theater, we thought we saw a crowded room with people in every seat, then our friend told us there was only one lady in the very back and suddenly we saw how empty it was. This made us just lose it. The sound meshing of the theater's bass mixed with our howling screams (at the previews) was too much to take. As my friend was busy watching the spindles of light manifest and rotate about the movie screen, I went into the deepest meditative state I've ever been in my life. My eyes were crosseyed and I literally saw what I'd call the spindles of consciousness. Two spinning fibrous greenish tornado beings is the best I can do to describe it. All the while my friend was too freaked out to sit still and started yelling at me in my ear. It sounded like he was a hundred miles away, I could barely hear him I was so far in my own mind. So our sober friend quickly ushered us out and back in the car, 20 dollars wasted on a movie where we didn't even make it past the 3rd preview.\n\nWe went to another friend's house who had just gotten home from school and her parents were gone. We tried hookin up the xbox and playin some halo2, I think I got 26 suicides while seriously trying to play and my friend kept dropping the controller and staring at the ceiling. And then outa nowhere her mom walked in. I can't even tell you the panic. Somehow we talked to her for a few minutes and she left, and then we went outside to the tire swing. This was def. one of the best and scariest parts of the trip. We had our friends wind us up and spin us on the swing, and when we opened our eyes it was like total mind-meltdown, I couldn't even tell you what planet I was on.\n\nSo even longer story short, night came and we were about 14 hours into the trip and still hardcore tripping, I mean tracers and hallucinations, no sign of a comedown. This is what freaked us out the most, everywhere we read had said 12 hours max and we were fucked beyond yesterday. We panicked cause we both were supposed to be home at certain times and we had to get our sober friends to write text messages to our parents telling them we were out for the night. Our best idea at the time was to tell our parents the next day we had been wasted cause anything would be better than them finding out we did acid.\n\n9:45pm and only a small hint of a comedown. our friend said she'd drive us to a local pharmacy and get us some herbal shit. It was supposed to 'detox' us or somethin but we both knew it was bullshit and we couldn't remember how to swallow pills anyway so we stuffed em in our pockets and pretended to take them. When we got back to her house we were way freaking out and decided it was up to us to learn how to 'reintegrate into society'. We tried immitating the other 'humans' aka non-acid-takers we saw in her house by eating muffins and playing cards. That lasted 20 seconds, we were too fucked to tell what our cards were or understand any purpose of the game.\n\n11pm still trippin and we have our original friend from the morning pick us up and take us to his house to crash for the night. In the meantime we had talked to dogs, plotted a genius escape by making our caretakers think we had disappeared and killed each other, and watched the most beautiful sunset you could possibly imagine.\n\nSo back at the house we attempted to go to sleep. 2 in the morning and we knew we were coming down but we still weren't sure when the hell it was all gonna be over. We had told our friend to sleep in the room with us in case his mom would have come down or something but that lazy mullet-haired water-head down syndrom son of a bitch said he wanted to sleep upstairs and that he'd be back in the morning. So after he leaves, we freak out for the last time of the trip and take it upon ourselves to create a 'fake friend' for our comfort lol. We put covers over a bunch of pillows to make it look like someone was asleep on the sofa and for whatever reason it just worked, totally reassured us for the rest of the night.\n\nAbout 4am and we were in and out of sleep, still really restless from almost 20 hours of non-stop tripping and NOTHING to eat all day. The tv was on but anytime we'd see human faces it would just freak us out and remind us how not normal we were, so we put it on the golf channel (and we HATE golf) all night just because there wasn't anything to horrific about watching a ball cross a green. After what seemed to be nine eternities (literally watching the seconds of the clock for hours) we somehow slept for a couple hours and awoke in the morning.\n\nVisuals had returned to normal but the lingering psychosis was still there, we just didn't feel like ourselves. We felt in some way detatched and we didn't think we were ready to go back into society. But we went our separate ways and that was that, followed by the next two days of reintegration. Things and thoughts became normal but it was an agonizingly slow process. The first time I talked to my mom the day after the trip I almost puked I was so nervous, but I sounded fine on the outside.\n\n","\n'Talking of Exhibitions, World's Fairs, and what not,' said the old\ngentleman, 'I would not go round the corner to see a dozen of them\nnowadays.  The only exhibition that ever made, or ever will make, any\nimpression upon my imagination was the first of the series, the parent of\nthem all, and now a thing of old times--the Great Exhibition of 1851, in\nHyde Park, London.  None of the younger generation can realize the sense\nof novelty it produced in us who were then in our prime.  A noun\nsubstantive went so far as to become an adjective in honour of the\noccasion.  It was \"exhibition\" hat, \"exhibition\" razor-strop,\n\"exhibition\" watch; nay, even \"exhibition\" weather, \"exhibition\" spirits,\nsweethearts, babies, wives--for the time.\n\n'For South Wessex, the year formed in many ways an extraordinary\nchronological frontier or transit-line, at which there occurred what one\nmight call a precipice in Time.  As in a geological \"fault,\" we had\npresented to us a sudden bringing of ancient and modern into absolute\ncontact, such as probably in no other single year since the Conquest was\never witnessed in this part of the country.'\n\nThese observations led us onward to talk of the different personages,\ngentle and simple, who lived and moved within our narrow and peaceful\nhorizon at that time; and of three people in particular, whose queer\nlittle history was oddly touched at points by the Exhibition, more\nconcerned with it than that of anybody else who dwelt in those outlying\nshades of the world, Stickleford, Mellstock, and Egdon.  First in\nprominence among these three came Wat Ollamoor--if that were his real\nname--whom the seniors in our party had known well.\n\nHe was a woman's man, they said,--supremely so--externally little else.\nTo men he was not attractive; perhaps a little repulsive at times.\nMusician, dandy, and company-man in practice; veterinary surgeon in\ntheory, he lodged awhile in Mellstock village, coming from nobody knew\nwhere; though some said his first appearance in this neighbourhood had\nbeen as fiddle-player in a show at Greenhill Fair.\n\nMany a worthy villager envied him his power over unsophisticated\nmaidenhood--a power which seemed sometimes to have a touch of the weird\nand wizardly in it.  Personally he was not ill-favoured, though rather un-\nEnglish, his complexion being a rich olive, his rank hair dark and rather\nclammy--made still clammier by secret ointments, which, when he came\nfresh to a party, caused him to smell like 'boys'-love' (southernwood)\nsteeped in lamp-oil.  On occasion he wore curls--a double row--running\nalmost horizontally around his head.  But as these were sometimes\nnoticeably absent, it was concluded that they were not altogether of\nNature's making.  By girls whose love for him had turned to hatred he had\nbeen nicknamed 'Mop,' from this abundance of hair, which was long enough\nto rest upon his shoulders; as time passed the name more and more\nprevailed.\n\nHis fiddling possibly had the most to do with the fascination he\nexercised, for, to speak fairly, it could claim for itself a most\npeculiar and personal quality, like that in a moving preacher.  There\nwere tones in it which bred the immediate conviction that indolence and\naverseness to systematic application were all that lay between 'Mop' and\nthe career of a second Paganini.\n\nWhile playing he invariably closed his eyes; using no notes, and, as it\nwere, allowing the violin to wander on at will into the most plaintive\npassages ever heard by rustic man.  There was a certain lingual character\nin the supplicatory expressions he produced, which would well nigh have\ndrawn an ache from the heart of a gate-post.  He could make any child in\nthe parish, who was at all sensitive to music, burst into tears in a few\nminutes by simply fiddling one of the old dance-tunes he almost entirely\naffected--country jigs, reels, and 'Favourite Quick Steps' of the last\ncentury--some mutilated remains of which even now reappear as nameless\nphantoms in new quadrilles and gallops, where they are recognized only by\nthe curious, or by such old-fashioned and far-between people as have been\nthrown with men like Wat Ollamoor in their early life.\n\nHis date was a little later than that of the old Mellstock quire-band\nwhich comprised the Dewys, Mail, and the rest--in fact, he did not rise\nabove the horizon thereabout till those well-known musicians were\ndisbanded as ecclesiastical functionaries.  In their honest love of\nthoroughness they despised the new man's style.  Theophilus Dewy (Reuben\nthe tranter's younger brother) used to say there was no 'plumness' in\nit--no bowing, no solidity--it was all fantastical.  And probably this\nwas true.  Anyhow, Mop had, very obviously, never bowed a note of church-\nmusic from his birth; he never once sat in the gallery of Mellstock\nchurch where the others had tuned their venerable psalmody so many\nhundreds of times; had never, in all likelihood, entered a church at all.\nAll were devil's tunes in his repertory.  'He could no more play the Wold\nHundredth to his true time than he could play the brazen serpent,' the\ntranter would say.  (The brazen serpent was supposed in Mellstock to be a\nmusical instrument particularly hard to blow.)\n\nOccasionally Mop could produce the aforesaid moving effect upon the souls\nof grown-up persons, especially young women of fragile and responsive\norganization.  Such an one was Car'line Aspent.  Though she was already\nengaged to be married before she met him, Car'line, of them all, was the\nmost influenced by Mop Ollamoor's heart-stealing melodies, to her\ndiscomfort, nay, positive pain and ultimate injury.  She was a pretty,\ninvocating, weak-mouthed girl, whose chief defect as a companion with her\nsex was a tendency to peevishness now and then.  At this time she was not\na resident in Mellstock parish where Mop lodged, but lived some miles off\nat Stickleford, farther down the river.\n\nHow and where she first made acquaintance with him and his fiddling is\nnot truly known, but the story was that it either began or was developed\non one spring evening, when, in passing through Lower Mellstock, she\nchanced to pause on the bridge near his house to rest herself, and\nlanguidly leaned over the parapet.  Mop was standing on his door-step, as\nwas his custom, spinning the insidious thread of semi- and\ndemi-semi-quavers from the E string of his fiddle for the benefit of\npassers-by, and laughing as the tears rolled down the cheeks of the\nlittle children hanging around him.  Car'line pretended to be engrossed\nwith the rippling of the stream under the arches, but in reality she was\nlistening, as he knew.  Presently the aching of the heart seized her\nsimultaneously with a wild desire to glide airily in the mazes of an\ninfinite dance.  To shake off the fascination she resolved to go on,\nalthough it would be necessary to pass him as he played.  On stealthily\nglancing ahead at the performer, she found to her relief that his eyes\nwere closed in abandonment to instrumentation, and she strode on boldly.\nBut when closer her step grew timid, her tread convulsed itself more and\nmore accordantly with the time of the melody, till she very nearly danced\nalong.  Gaining another glance at him when immediately opposite, she saw\nthat _one_ of his eyes was open, quizzing her as he smiled at her\nemotional state.  Her gait could not divest itself of its compelled\ncapers till she had gone a long way past the house; and Car'line was\nunable to shake off the strange infatuation for hours.\n\nAfter that day, whenever there was to be in the neighbourhood a dance to\nwhich she could get an invitation, and where Mop Ollamoor was to be the\nmusician, Car'line contrived to be present, though it sometimes involved\na walk of several miles; for he did not play so often in Stickleford as\nelsewhere.\n\nThe next evidences of his influence over her were singular enough, and it\nwould require a neurologist to fully explain them.  She would be sitting\nquietly, any evening after dark, in the house of her father, the parish\nclerk, which stood in the middle of Stickleford village street, this\nbeing the highroad between Lower Mellstock and Moreford, five miles\neastward.  Here, without a moment's warning, and in the midst of a\ngeneral conversation between her father, sister, and the young man before\nalluded to, who devotedly wooed her in ignorance of her infatuation, she\nwould start from her seat in the chimney-corner as if she had received a\ngalvanic shock, and spring convulsively towards the ceiling; then she\nwould burst into tears, and it was not till some half-hour had passed\nthat she grew calm as usual.  Her father, knowing her hysterical\ntendencies, was always excessively anxious about this trait in his\nyoungest girl, and feared the attack to be a species of epileptic fit.\nNot so her sister Julia.  Julia had found out what was the cause.  At the\nmoment before the jumping, only an exceptionally sensitive ear situated\nin the chimney-nook could have caught from down the flue the beat of a\nman's footstep along the highway without.  But it was in that footfall,\nfor which she had been waiting, that the origin of Car'line's involuntary\nspringing lay.  The pedestrian was Mop Ollamoor, as the girl well knew;\nbut his business that way was not to visit her; he sought another woman\nwhom he spoke of as his Intended, and who lived at Moreford, two miles\nfarther on.  On one, and only one, occasion did it happen that Car'line\ncould not control her utterance; it was when her sister alone chanced to\nbe present.  'Oh--oh--oh--!' she cried.  'He's going to _her_, and not\ncoming to _me_!'\n\nTo do the fiddler justice he had not at first thought greatly of, or\nspoken much to, this girl of impressionable mould.  But he had soon found\nout her secret, and could not resist a little by-play with her too easily\nhurt heart, as an interlude between his more serious performances at\nMoreford.  The two became well acquainted, though only by stealth, hardly\na soul in Stickleford except her sister, and her lover Ned Hipcroft,\nbeing aware of the attachment.  Her father disapproved of her coldness to\nNed; her sister, too, hoped she might get over this nervous passion for a\nman of whom so little was known.  The ultimate result was that Car'line's\nmanly and simple wooer Edward found his suit becoming practically\nhopeless.  He was a respectable mechanic, in a far sounder position than\nMop the nominal horse-doctor; but when, before leaving her, Ned put his\nflat and final question, would she marry him, then and there, now or\nnever, it was with little expectation of obtaining more than the negative\nshe gave him.  Though her father supported him and her sister supported\nhim, he could not play the fiddle so as to draw your soul out of your\nbody like a spider's thread, as Mop did, till you felt as limp as withy-\nwind and yearned for something to cling to.  Indeed, Hipcroft had not the\nslightest ear for music; could not sing two notes in tune, much less play\nthem.\n\nThe No he had expected and got from her, in spite of a preliminary\nencouragement, gave Ned a new start in life.  It had been uttered in such\na tone of sad entreaty that he resolved to persecute her no more; she\nshould not even be distressed by a sight of his form in the distant\nperspective of the street and lane.  He left the place, and his natural\ncourse was to London.\n\nThe railway to South Wessex was in process of construction, but it was\nnot as yet opened for traffic; and Hipcroft reached the capital by a six\ndays' trudge on foot, as many a better man had done before him.  He was\none of the last of the artisan class who used that now extinct method of\ntravel to the great centres of labour, so customary then from time\nimmemorial.\n\nIn London he lived and worked regularly at his trade.  More fortunate\nthan many, his disinterested willingness recommended him from the first.\nDuring the ensuing four years he was never out of employment.  He neither\nadvanced nor receded in the modern sense; he improved as a workman, but\nhe did not shift one jot in social position.  About his love for Car'line\nhe maintained a rigid silence.  No doubt he often thought of her; but\nbeing always occupied, and having no relations at Stickleford, he held no\ncommunication with that part of the country, and showed no desire to\nreturn.  In his quiet lodging in Lambeth he moved about after working-\nhours with the facility of a woman, doing his own cooking, attending to\nhis stocking-heels, and shaping himself by degrees to a life-long\nbachelorhood.  For this conduct one is bound to advance the canonical\nreason that time could not efface from his heart the image of little\nCar'line Aspent--and it may be in part true; but there was also the\ninference that his was a nature not greatly dependent upon the\nministrations of the other sex for its comforts.\n\nThe fourth year of his residence as a mechanic in London was the year of\nthe Hyde-Park Exhibition already mentioned, and at the construction of\nthis huge glass-house, then unexampled in the world's history, he worked\ndaily.  It was an era of great hope and activity among the nations and\nindustries.  Though Hipcroft was, in his small way, a central man in the\nmovement, he plodded on with his usual outward placidity.  Yet for him,\ntoo, the year was destined to have its surprises, for when the bustle of\ngetting the building ready for the opening day was past, the ceremonies\nhad been witnessed, and people were flocking thither from all parts of\nthe globe, he received a letter from Car'line.  Till that day the silence\nof four years between himself and Stickleford had never been broken.\n\nShe informed her old lover, in an uncertain penmanship which suggested a\ntrembling hand, of the trouble she had been put to in ascertaining his\naddress, and then broached the subject which had prompted her to write.\nFour years ago, she said with the greatest delicacy of which she was\ncapable, she had been so foolish as to refuse him.  Her wilful\nwrong-headedness had since been a grief to her many times, and of late\nparticularly.  As for Mr. Ollamoor, he had been absent almost as long as\nNed--she did not know where.  She would gladly marry Ned now if he were\nto ask her again, and be a tender little wife to him till her life's end.\n\nA tide of warm feeling must have surged through Ned Hipcroft's frame on\nreceipt of this news, if we may judge by the issue.  Unquestionably he\nloved her still, even if not to the exclusion of every other happiness.\nThis from his Car'line, she who had been dead to him these many years,\nalive to him again as of old, was in itself a pleasant, gratifying thing.\nNed had grown so resigned to, or satisfied with, his lonely lot, that he\nprobably would not have shown much jubilation at anything.  Still, a\ncertain ardour of preoccupation, after his first surprise, revealed how\ndeeply her confession of faith in him had stirred him.  Measured and\nmethodical in his ways, he did not answer the letter that day, nor the\nnext, nor the next.  He was having 'a good think.'  When he did answer\nit, there was a great deal of sound reasoning mixed in with the\nunmistakable tenderness of his reply; but the tenderness itself was\nsufficient to reveal that he was pleased with her straightforward\nfrankness; that the anchorage she had once obtained in his heart was\nrenewable, if it had not been continuously firm.\n\nHe told her--and as he wrote his lips twitched humorously over the few\ngentle words of raillery he indited among the rest of his sentences--that\nit was all very well for her to come round at this time of day.  Why\nwouldn't she have him when he wanted her?  She had no doubt learned that\nhe was not married, but suppose his affections had since been fixed on\nanother?  She ought to beg his pardon.  Still, he was not the man to\nforget her.  But considering how he had been used, and what he had\nsuffered, she could not quite expect him to go down to Stickleford and\nfetch her.  But if she would come to him, and say she was sorry, as was\nonly fair; why, yes, he would marry her, knowing what a good little woman\nshe was at the core.  He added that the request for her to come to him\nwas a less one to make than it would have been when he first left\nStickleford, or even a few months ago; for the new railway into South\nWessex was now open, and there had just begun to be run wonderfully\ncontrived special trains, called excursion-trains, on account of the\nGreat Exhibition; so that she could come up easily alone.\n\nShe said in her reply how good it was of him to treat her so generously,\nafter her hot and cold treatment of him; that though she felt frightened\nat the magnitude of the journey, and was never as yet in a railway-train,\nhaving only seen one pass at a distance, she embraced his offer with all\nher heart; and would, indeed, own to him how sorry she was, and beg his\npardon, and try to be a good wife always, and make up for lost time.\n\nThe remaining details of when and where were soon settled, Car'line\ninforming him, for her ready identification in the crowd, that she would\nbe wearing 'my new sprigged-laylock cotton gown,' and Ned gaily\nresponding that, having married her the morning after her arrival, he\nwould make a day of it by taking her to the Exhibition.  One early summer\nafternoon, accordingly, he came from his place of work, and hastened\ntowards Waterloo Station to meet her.  It was as wet and chilly as an\nEnglish June day can occasionally be, but as he waited on the platform in\nthe drizzle he glowed inwardly, and seemed to have something to live for\nagain.\n\nThe 'excursion-train'--an absolutely new departure in the history of\ntravel--was still a novelty on the Wessex line, and probably everywhere.\nCrowds of people had flocked to all the stations on the way up to witness\nthe unwonted sight of so long a train's passage, even where they did not\ntake advantage of the opportunity it offered.  The seats for the humbler\nclass of travellers in these early experiments in steam-locomotion, were\nopen trucks, without any protection whatever from the wind and rain; and\ndamp weather having set in with the afternoon, the unfortunate occupants\nof these vehicles were, on the train drawing up at the London terminus,\nfound to be in a pitiable condition from their long journey; blue-faced,\nstiff-necked, sneezing, rain-beaten, chilled to the marrow, many of the\nmen being hatless; in fact, they resembled people who had been out all\nnight in an open boat on a rough sea, rather than inland excursionists\nfor pleasure.  The women had in some degree protected themselves by\nturning up the skirts of their gowns over their heads, but as by this\narrangement they were additionally exposed about the hips, they were all\nmore or less in a sorry plight.\n\nIn the bustle and crush of alighting forms of both sexes which followed\nthe entry of the huge concatenation into the station, Ned Hipcroft soon\ndiscerned the slim little figure his eye was in search of, in the\nsprigged lilac, as described.  She came up to him with a frightened\nsmile--still pretty, though so damp, weather-beaten, and shivering from\nlong exposure to the wind.\n\n'O Ned!' she sputtered, 'I--I--'  He clasped her in his arms and kissed\nher, whereupon she burst into a flood of tears.\n\n'You are wet, my poor dear!  I hope you'll not get cold,' he said.  And\nsurveying her and her multifarious surrounding packages, he noticed that\nby the hand she led a toddling child--a little girl of three or so--whose\nhood was as clammy and tender face as blue as those of the other\ntravellers.\n\n'Who is this--somebody you know?' asked Ned curiously.\n\n'Yes, Ned.  She's mine.'\n\n'Yours?'\n\n'Yes--my own!'\n\n'Your own child?'\n\n'Yes!'\n\n'Well--as God's in--'\n\n'Ned, I didn't name it in my letter, because, you see, it would have been\nso hard to explain!  I thought that when we met I could tell you how she\nhappened to be born, so much better than in writing!  I hope you'll\nexcuse it this once, dear Ned, and not scold me, now I've come so many,\nmany miles!'\n\n'This means Mr. Mop Ollamoor, I reckon!' said Hipcroft, gazing palely at\nthem from the distance of the yard or two to which he had withdrawn with\na start.\n\nCar'line gasped.  'But he's been gone away for years!' she supplicated.\n'And I never had a young man before!  And I was so onlucky to be catched\nthe first time, though some of the girls down there go on like anything!'\n\nNed remained in silence, pondering.\n\n'You'll forgive me, dear Ned?' she added, beginning to sob outright.  'I\nhaven't taken 'ee in after all, because--because you can pack us back\nagain, if you want to; though 'tis hundreds o' miles, and so wet, and\nnight a-coming on, and I with no money!'\n\n'What the devil can I do!' Hipcroft groaned.\n\nA more pitiable picture than the pair of helpless creatures presented was\nnever seen on a rainy day, as they stood on the great, gaunt, puddled\nplatform, a whiff of drizzle blowing under the roof upon them now and\nthen; the pretty attire in which they had started from Stickleford in the\nearly morning bemuddled and sodden, weariness on their faces, and fear of\nhim in their eyes; for the child began to look as if she thought she too\nhad done some wrong, remaining in an appalled silence till the tears\nrolled down her chubby cheeks.\n\n'What's the matter, my little maid?' said Ned mechanically.\n\n'I do want to go home!' she let out, in tones that told of a bursting\nheart.  'And my totties be cold, an' I shan't have no bread an' butter no\nmore!'\n\n'I don't know what to say to it all!' declared Ned, his own eye moist as\nhe turned and walked a few steps with his head down; then regarded them\nagain point blank.  From the child escaped troubled breaths and silently\nwelling tears.\n\n'Want some bread and butter, do 'ee?' he said, with factitious hardness.\n\n'Ye-e-s!'\n\n'Well, I daresay I can get 'ee a bit!  Naturally, you must want some.  And\nyou, too, for that matter, Car'line.'\n\n'I do feel a little hungered.  But I can keep it off,' she murmured.\n\n'Folk shouldn't do that,' he said gruffly. . . . 'There come along!' he\ncaught up the child, as he added, 'You must bide here to-night, anyhow, I\ns'pose!  What can you do otherwise?  I'll get 'ee some tea and victuals;\nand as for this job, I'm sure I don't know what to say!  This is the way\nout.'\n\nThey pursued their way, without speaking, to Ned's lodgings, which were\nnot far off.  There he dried them and made them comfortable, and prepared\ntea; they thankfully sat down.  The ready-made household of which he\nsuddenly found himself the head imparted a cosy aspect to his room, and a\npaternal one to himself.  Presently he turned to the child and kissed her\nnow blooming cheeks; and, looking wistfully at Car'line, kissed her also.\n\n'I don't see how I can send 'ee back all them miles,' he growled, 'now\nyou've come all the way o' purpose to join me.  But you must trust me,\nCar'line, and show you've real faith in me.  Well, do you feel better\nnow, my little woman?'\n\nThe child nodded, her mouth being otherwise occupied.\n\n'I did trust you, Ned, in coming; and I shall always!'\n\nThus, without any definite agreement to forgive her, he tacitly\nacquiesced in the fate that Heaven had sent him; and on the day of their\nmarriage (which was not quite so soon as he had expected it could be, on\naccount of the time necessary for banns) he took her to the Exhibition\nwhen they came back from church, as he had promised.  While standing near\na large mirror in one of the courts devoted to furniture, Car'line\nstarted, for in the glass appeared the reflection of a form exactly\nresembling Mop Ollamoor's--so exactly, that it seemed impossible to\nbelieve anybody but that artist in person to be the original.  On passing\nround the objects which hemmed in Ned, her, and the child from a direct\nview, no Mop was to be seen.  Whether he were really in London or not at\nthat time was never known; and Car'line always stoutly denied that her\nreadiness to go and meet Ned in town arose from any rumour that Mop had\nalso gone thither; which denial there was no reasonable ground for\ndoubting.\n\nAnd then the year glided away, and the Exhibition folded itself up and\nbecame a thing of the past.  The park trees that had been enclosed for\nsix months were again exposed to the winds and storms, and the sod grew\ngreen anew.  Ned found that Car'line resolved herself into a very good\nwife and companion, though she had made herself what is called cheap to\nhim; but in that she was like another domestic article, a cheap tea-pot,\nwhich often brews better tea than a dear one.  One autumn Hipcroft found\nhimself with but little work to do, and a prospect of less for the\nwinter.  Both being country born and bred, they fancied they would like\nto live again in their natural atmosphere.  It was accordingly decided\nbetween them that they should leave the pent-up London lodging, and that\nNed should seek out employment near his native place, his wife and her\ndaughter staying with Car'line's father during the search for occupation\nand an abode of their own.\n\nTinglings of pleasure pervaded Car'line's spasmodic little frame as she\njourneyed down with Ned to the place she had left two or three years\nbefore, in silence and under a cloud.  To return to where she had once\nbeen despised, a smiling London wife with a distinct London accent, was a\ntriumph which the world did not witness every day.\n\nThe train did not stop at the petty roadside station that lay nearest to\nStickleford, and the trio went on to Casterbridge.  Ned thought it a good\nopportunity to make a few preliminary inquiries for employment at\nworkshops in the borough where he had been known; and feeling cold from\nher journey, and it being dry underfoot and only dusk as yet, with a moon\non the point of rising, Car'line and her little girl walked on toward\nStickleford, leaving Ned to follow at a quicker pace, and pick her up at\na certain half-way house, widely known as an inn.\n\nThe woman and child pursued the well-remembered way comfortably enough,\nthough they were both becoming wearied.  In the course of three miles\nthey had passed Heedless-William's Pond, the familiar landmark by Bloom's\nEnd, and were drawing near the Quiet Woman Inn, a lone roadside hostel on\nthe lower verge of the Egdon Heath, since and for many years abolished.\nIn stepping up towards it Car'line heard more voices within than had\nformerly been customary at such an hour, and she learned that an auction\nof fat stock had been held near the spot that afternoon.  The child would\nbe the better for a rest as well as herself, she thought, and she\nentered.\n\nThe guests and customers overflowed into the passage, and Car'line had no\nsooner crossed the threshold than a man whom she remembered by sight came\nforward with glass and mug in his hands towards a friend leaning against\nthe wall; but, seeing her, very gallantly offered her a drink of the\nliquor, which was gin-and-beer hot, pouring her out a tumblerful and\nsaying, in a moment or two: 'Surely, 'tis little Car'line Aspent that\nwas--down at Stickleford?'\n\nShe assented, and, though she did not exactly want this beverage, she\ndrank it since it was offered, and her entertainer begged her to come in\nfarther and sit down.  Once within the room she found that all the\npersons present were seated close against the walls, and there being a\nchair vacant she did the same.  An explanation of their position occurred\nthe next moment.  In the opposite corner stood Mop, rosining his bow and\nlooking just the same as ever.  The company had cleared the middle of the\nroom for dancing, and they were about to dance again.  As she wore a veil\nto keep off the wind she did not think he had recognized her, or could\npossibly guess the identity of the child; and to her satisfied surprise\nshe found that she could confront him quite calmly--mistress of herself\nin the dignity her London life had given her.  Before she had quite\nemptied her glass the dance was called, the dancers formed in two lines,\nthe music sounded, and the figure began.\n\nThen matters changed for Car'line.  A tremor quickened itself to life in\nher, and her hand so shook that she could hardly set down her glass.  It\nwas not the dance nor the dancers, but the notes of that old violin which\nthrilled the London wife, these having still all the witchery that she\nhad so well known of yore, and under which she had used to lose her power\nof independent will.  How it all came back!  There was the fiddling\nfigure against the wall; the large, oily, mop-like head of him, and\nbeneath the mop the face with closed eyes.\n\nAfter the first moments of paralyzed reverie the familiar tune in the\nfamiliar rendering made her laugh and shed tears simultaneously.  Then a\nman at the bottom of the dance, whose partner had dropped away, stretched\nout his hand and beckoned to her to take the place.  She did not want to\ndance; she entreated by signs to be left where she was, but she was\nentreating of the tune and its player rather than of the dancing man.  The\nsaltatory tendency which the fiddler and his cunning instrument had ever\nbeen able to start in her was seizing Car'line just as it had done in\nearlier years, possibly assisted by the gin-and-beer hot.  Tired as she\nwas she grasped her little girl by the hand, and plunging in at the\nbottom of the figure, whirled about with the rest.  She found that her\ncompanions were mostly people of the neighbouring hamlets and\nfarms--Bloom's End, Mellstock, Lewgate, and elsewhere; and by degrees she\nwas recognized as she convulsively danced on, wishing that Mop would\ncease and let her heart rest from the aching he caused, and her feet\nalso.\n\nAfter long and many minutes the dance ended, when she was urged to\nfortify herself with more gin-and-beer; which she did, feeling very weak\nand overpowered with hysteric emotion.  She refrained from unveiling, to\nkeep Mop in ignorance of her presence, if possible.  Several of the\nguests having left, Car'line hastily wiped her lips and also turned to\ngo; but, according to the account of some who remained, at that very\nmoment a five-handed reel was proposed, in which two or three begged her\nto join.\n\nShe declined on the plea of being tired and having to walk to\nStickleford, when Mop began aggressively tweedling 'My Fancy-Lad,' in D\nmajor, as the air to which the reel was to be footed.  He must have\nrecognized her, though she did not know it, for it was the strain of all\nseductive strains which she was least able to resist--the one he had\nplayed when she was leaning over the bridge at the date of their first\nacquaintance.  Car'line stepped despairingly into the middle of the room\nwith the other four.\n\nReels were resorted to hereabouts at this time by the more robust\nspirits, for the reduction of superfluous energy which the ordinary\nfigure-dances were not powerful enough to exhaust.  As everybody knows,\nor does not know, the five reelers stood in the form of a cross, the reel\nbeing performed by each line of three alternately, the persons who\nsuccessively came to the middle place dancing in both directions.\nCar'line soon found herself in this place, the axis of the whole\nperformance, and could not get out of it, the tune turning into the first\npart without giving her opportunity.  And now she began to suspect that\nMop did know her, and was doing this on purpose, though whenever she\nstole a glance at him his closed eyes betokened obliviousness to\neverything outside his own brain.  She continued to wend her way through\nthe figure of 8 that was formed by her course, the fiddler introducing\ninto his notes the wild and agonizing sweetness of a living voice in one\ntoo highly wrought; its pathos running high and running low in endless\nvariation, projecting through her nerves excruciating spasms, a sort of\nblissful torture.  The room swam, the tune was endless; and in about a\nquarter of an hour the only other woman in the figure dropped out\nexhausted, and sank panting on a bench.\n\nThe reel instantly resolved itself into a four-handed one.  Car'line\nwould have given anything to leave off; but she had, or fancied she had,\nno power, while Mop played such tunes; and thus another ten minutes\nslipped by, a haze of dust now clouding the candles, the floor being of\nstone, sanded.  Then another dancer fell out--one of the men--and went\ninto the passage, in a frantic search for liquor.  To turn the figure\ninto a three-handed reel was the work of a second, Mop modulating at the\nsame time into 'The Fairy Dance,' as better suited to the contracted\nmovement, and no less one of those foods of love which, as manufactured\nby his bow, had always intoxicated her.\n\nIn a reel for three there was no rest whatever, and four or five minutes\nwere enough to make her remaining two partners, now thoroughly blown,\nstamp their last bar and, like their predecessors, limp off into the next\nroom to get something to drink.  Car'line, half-stifled inside her veil,\nwas left dancing alone, the apartment now being empty of everybody save\nherself, Mop, and their little girl.\n\nShe flung up the veil, and cast her eyes upon him, as if imploring him to\nwithdraw himself and his acoustic magnetism from the atmosphere.  Mop\nopened one of his own orbs, as though for the first time, fixed it\npeeringly upon her, and smiling dreamily, threw into his strains the\nreserve of expression which he could not afford to waste on a big and\nnoisy dance.  Crowds of little chromatic subtleties, capable of drawing\ntears from a statue, proceeded straightway from the ancient fiddle, as if\nit were dying of the emotion which had been pent up within it ever since\nits banishment from some Italian city where it first took shape and\nsound.  There was that in the look of Mop's one dark eye which said: 'You\ncannot leave off, dear, whether you would or no!' and it bred in her a\nparoxysm of desperation that defied him to tire her down.\n\nShe thus continued to dance alone, defiantly as she thought, but in truth\nslavishly and abjectly, subject to every wave of the melody, and probed\nby the gimlet-like gaze of her fascinator's open eye; keeping up at the\nsame time a feeble smile in his face, as a feint to signify it was still\nher own pleasure which led her on.  A terrified embarrassment as to what\nshe could say to him if she were to leave off, had its unrecognized share\nin keeping her going.  The child, who was beginning to be distressed by\nthe strange situation, came up and said: 'Stop, mother, stop, and let's\ngo home!' as she seized Car'line's hand.\n\nSuddenly Car'line sank staggering to the floor; and rolling over on her\nface, prone she remained.  Mop's fiddle thereupon emitted an elfin shriek\nof finality; stepping quickly down from the nine-gallon beer-cask which\nhad formed his rostrum, he went to the little girl, who disconsolately\nbent over her mother.\n\nThe guests who had gone into the back-room for liquor and change of air,\nhearing something unusual, trooped back hitherward, where they\nendeavoured to revive poor, weak Car'line by blowing her with the bellows\nand opening the window.  Ned, her husband, who had been detained in\nCasterbridge, as aforesaid, came along the road at this juncture, and\nhearing excited voices through the open casement, and to his great\nsurprise, the mention of his wife's name, he entered amid the rest upon\nthe scene.  Car'line was now in convulsions, weeping violently, and for a\nlong time nothing could be done with her.  While he was sending for a\ncart to take her onward to Stickleford Hipcroft anxiously inquired how it\nhad all happened; and then the assembly explained that a fiddler formerly\nknown in the locality had lately revisited his old haunts, and had taken\nupon himself without invitation to play that evening at the inn.\n\nNed demanded the fiddler's name, and they said Ollamoor.\n\n'Ah!' exclaimed Ned, looking round him.  'Where is he, and where--where's\nmy little girl?'\n\nOllamoor had disappeared, and so had the child.  Hipcroft was in ordinary\na quiet and tractable fellow, but a determination which was to be feared\nsettled in his face now.  'Blast him!' he cried.  'I'll beat his skull in\nfor'n, if I swing for it to-morrow!'\n\nHe had rushed to the poker which lay on the hearth, and hastened down the\npassage, the people following.  Outside the house, on the other side of\nthe highway, a mass of dark heath-land rose sullenly upward to its not\neasily accessible interior, a ravined plateau, whereon jutted into the\nsky, at the distance of a couple of miles, the fir-woods of Mistover\nbacked by the Yalbury coppices--a place of Dantesque gloom at this hour,\nwhich would have afforded secure hiding for a battery of artillery, much\nless a man and a child.\n\nSome other men plunged thitherward with him, and more went along the\nroad.  They were gone about twenty minutes altogether, returning without\nresult to the inn.  Ned sat down in the settle, and clasped his forehead\nwith his hands.\n\n'Well--what a fool the man is, and hev been all these years, if he thinks\nthe child his, as a' do seem to!' they whispered.  'And everybody else\nknowing otherwise!'\n\n'No, I don't think 'tis mine!' cried Ned hoarsely, as he looked up from\nhis hands.  'But she is mine, all the same!  Ha'n't I nussed her?  Ha'n't\nI fed her and teached her?  Ha'n't I played wi' her?  O, little\nCarry--gone with that rogue--gone!'\n\n'You ha'n't lost your mis'ess, anyhow,' they said to console him.  'She's\nthrowed up the sperrits, and she is feeling better, and she's more to 'ee\nthan a child that isn't yours.'\n\n'She isn't!  She's not so particular much to me, especially now she's\nlost the little maid!  But Carry's everything!'\n\n'Well, ver' like you'll find her to-morrow.'\n\n'Ah--but shall I?  Yet he _can't_ hurt her--surely he can't!  Well--how's\nCar'line now?  I am ready.  Is the cart here?'\n\nShe was lifted into the vehicle, and they sadly lumbered on toward\nStickleford.  Next day she was calmer; but the fits were still upon her;\nand her will seemed shattered.  For the child she appeared to show\nsingularly little anxiety, though Ned was nearly distracted.  It was\nnevertheless quite expected that the impish Mop would restore the lost\none after a freak of a day or two; but time went on, and neither he nor\nshe could be heard of, and Hipcroft murmured that perhaps he was\nexercising upon her some unholy musical charm, as he had done upon\nCar'line herself.  Weeks passed, and still they could obtain no clue\neither to the fiddler's whereabouts or the girl's; and how he could have\ninduced her to go with him remained a mystery.\n\nThen Ned, who had obtained only temporary employment in the\nneighbourhood, took a sudden hatred toward his native district, and a\nrumour reaching his ears through the police that a somewhat similar man\nand child had been seen at a fair near London, he playing a violin, she\ndancing on stilts, a new interest in the capital took possession of\nHipcroft with an intensity which would scarcely allow him time to pack\nbefore returning thither.\n\nHe did not, however, find the lost one, though he made it the entire\nbusiness of his over-hours to stand about in by-streets in the hope of\ndiscovering her, and would start up in the night, saying, 'That rascal's\ntorturing her to maintain him!'  To which his wife would answer\npeevishly, 'Don't 'ee raft yourself so, Ned!  You prevent my getting a\nbit o' rest!  He won't hurt her!' and fall asleep again.\n\nThat Carry and her father had emigrated to America was the general\nopinion; Mop, no doubt, finding the girl a highly desirable companion\nwhen he had trained her to keep him by her earnings as a dancer.  There,\nfor that matter, they may be performing in some capacity now, though he\nmust be an old scamp verging on threescore-and-ten, and she a woman of\nfour-and-forty.\n\n","Can you hear me calling out your name?\nYou know that I'm falling and I don't know what to say.\n\nI'll speak a little louder, I'll even shout.\nYou know that I'm proud and I can't get the words out.\n\nOh I, I want to be with you everywhere.\n\nSomething's happening, happening to me.\nMy friends say I'm acting peculiarly.\n\nC'mon baby we better make a start.\nYou better make it soon before you break my heart.\n\n","Replying*","I once had a girl\nOr should I say she once had me\nShe showed me her room\nIsn't it good Norwegian wood?\n\nShe asked me to stay\nAnd she told me to sit anywhere\nSo I looked around\nAnd I noticed there wasn't a chair\n\nI sat on the rug biding my time, drinking her wine\nWe talked until two and then she said it's time for bed\n\nShe told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.\nI told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath\n\nAnd when I awoke I was alone\nThis bird had flown\nSo I lit a fire\nIsn't it good Norwegian wood?\n\n","So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?\nThis bottle opener.\nAnd?\nAnd it’s a magnet!\nLook at that!\nHow weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.\nWhat?!\nYou complete me kitchen, matey!\nRoss, I know what you’re thinking.\nWhat?\nThat she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad.\nOh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!\nWhat?!!\nOf course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always, \"Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?\" \"Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?\" \"When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?\" You want her!\nNo!\nHello?\nHey Rach, aren’t these candlesticks mine?\nNo-no, I bought those.\nOhh! Yeah, I forgot.\nYeah.Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!\nWow! Uh what, did he uh, say?\nWell remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.\nWell, who wouldn’t?!\nI know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? \"Professor Geller.\"\nYeah, Professor and Mrs.\nAnd Mrs.?!\nOh! Yeah, y’know you and Ross are still married.\nWhat?!!\nJust kidding!\nOhh! Oh God!\nSaved your ass.\nHey!\nHi.\nHey!\nOh, what’s the matter?\nWell, you know that psychic I see?\nYeah?\nWell, she told me that I’m gonna die this week, so I’m kinda bummed about that.\nWhat?!\nYeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.\nPhoebe that’s crazy!\nI can’t believe she would say that too you.\nYeah honey you don’t believe her do you?\nI don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.\nJust out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?\nNo, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left, y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now!\nHey everyone!\nOh hi!\nHey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?\nOh that’d be great. Sure!\n\"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…\"\nOh, this is it. This what’s gonna kill me.\n\"…subcategories. The first of these subcategories is…\"\nUh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?\nNo! Why?\nWell, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn’t have naked chicks on it.\nOhh! Okay! Okay. into…\"\nWhy don’t you open with a joke?\nOpen with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!\nWait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!\nOkay!\nOhh! We’re kidding! Oh, we’re kidding!\nRoss, hey you know what might make it less boring?\nThank you!\nSome uh, some visual aides.\nOh-ooh-ooh! Y’know what’s a good visual aide?\nPlease don’t say naked chicks.\nWhy not?!\nI-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.\nThat’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.\nHey.\nHey! Any good mail?\nYes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild.\nOoh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I’m kinda….\n\"Benefits lapsed.\"\nHmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.\nOkay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.\nLet me see that!\nAll right.\nOh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I gotta be careful?!\nI’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to stop catching on fire.\nAll right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.\nOkay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.\nHey!\nHey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing?\nUgh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could—\nPheebs, what-what are you doing?\nI was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?\nOh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?\nYeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.\nMonica!\nHmm?\nDid-did you take these back?\nNo-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.\nOh yeah, they’re really great! Aren’t they?\nI loved them!\nYeah.\nHello!\nHey!\nHey!\nHow’d the lecture go?\nIt went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!\nWow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.\nI knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all, \"Ross you have to be funny and sexy.\" Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.\nThat you’re not funny or sexy?\nThat’s right!\nHey Estelle, listen…\nWell! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!\nWhat are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been my agent!\nReally?!\nYeah!\nOh well, no harm, no foul.\nEstelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.\nAll right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.\nWhy?\nWell, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.\nBastard!\nHey!\nHey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time.\nThat’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?\nWhat?!\nWhat’s wrong with you?\nNothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.\nThis sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!\nNo way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!\nThat’s a hernia.\nWhy did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!\nWell, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes.\nYeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch.\nYeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Wow, we really are bitches.\nOh bloody hell.\nWhat the hell are you doing?!\nLook, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.\nYeah, and not a very good one.\nWill you-will you please?\nDr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I’m a professor in the paleontology department here.\nOh.\nDo you have a moment to talk about your lecture?\nI’m sorry, I’ve got plans with my sister.What are you doing?\nTop ‘O the morning to ya laddies!\nJust please stop!\nYes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.\nHey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!\nDude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.\nI will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.\nThank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.\nHey!\nHey.\nHey!\nWhat’s going on?\nOh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!\nLook, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn’t hurt that bad.\nHey! Maybe you’ll die!\nSure, now I’m scared.\nNo, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.\nYeah, but I don’t wanna die!\nNo-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!\nGimme ‘em!\nNo! They are mine!\nYou stole them from me!\nYou stole them from me!!\nGimme them!\nYou just wanna each take one?\nYeah that seems fair. We never use them.\nLook, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?\nWell…\nWhy don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.\nYeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!\nThey’re not listening too me?\nOf course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.\nMonica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?\nI think you look fine.\nCasting Director #1: Whenever you’re ready.\nOkay. \"Hey, Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you.\"\nCasting Director #1: Hold it. I’m sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less…intense?\nOh yeah, sure, no problem, I’ll just—hold on one second. \"Hey Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you!\"\nCasting Director #1: Oh my God!!\nSo that’s why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!\nCasting Director #2: That’s where you pick up the bag.\nExactly.\nCasting Director #2: No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.\nOr, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn’t get it, did I?\nCasting Director #2: No.\nYeah, okay.\nHi. I’m Joey Tribbiani; I’m here to audition for man.\nCasting Director #3: You mean dying man?\nYes!\nOkay, come on, do it one more time!\nReally? Really?!\nYes!\nOkay!\nHey!\nHey!\nListen to this! My reading was wrong, I’m not going die!\nReally?! How do you know?\nBecause my psychic is dead! She must’ve read the cards wrong!\nOh, I’m sorry.\nEh, better her than me! Hey, let’s bake cookies!\nListen, I’m really glad you got the part.\nThank you.\nBut are you sure you can do this?\nYeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.\nNow, is that never talking about it again?!\nHiya!\nHey Joey, we’re ready for ya!

Can I take a message?\nYes, this Russell, Ross’s divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven’t heard from him, I assume he’s decided to give the marriage a try.\nRoss got married again—Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!A Student: What’s happening to your accent?\nAll right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression…\nRoss!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!\nWell, hello Rachel!\nHave you really done this before?\nYeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing.

The entire city is blacked out!\nMom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.\nWow, you guys, this is big.Can I borrow the phone?

Something... something Goodacre.\nHi Mom, it's Jill.\nShe's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!\nYeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.\nJill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.\nI'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.\nOh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.\nHi everyone.\nAnd officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.\nWell, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.\nEww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.\nThat had to hurt!\nAlright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.

OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.\nWhoooaa!\nThat's my sister.\nOK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.\nOh my God!

So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.\nOh, Rachel.\nOh come on, I already went.\nYou did not go!\nCome on.\nOh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.\nStep back.\nWe have a winner!\nI just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.\nWell, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.\nThere, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.\nCome on.\nNo, he said we were holding up the people behind us.\nAnd you didn't marry him because...?\nI mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...\nProbably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.\nYeah right.\nIt is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.\nOK.\nBut, um... I don't think that's going to be you.\nYou don't.\nUh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.\nReally?\nMmmm.\nYou do?\nI do.\nOh Ross, you're so great.\nIt's never gonna happen.\nWhat?\nYou and Rachel.\nWhy not?\nBecause you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.\nNo, no, no. I'm not in the zone.\nRoss, you're mayor of the zone.\nI'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...\nPriesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.\nI will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?\nYeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'\nShhhh!\nWhat are you shushing?\nWe're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Don't you hear that?\nAhhhh!\nSee?\nHuh.\nWould you like some gum?\nUm, is it sugarless?\nSorry, it's not.\nOh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.\nOK, here goes.\nAre you going to do it?\nI'm going to do it.\nDo you want any help?\nYou come out there, you're a dead man.\nGood luck, man.\nThanks. OK.\nOK.\nHey, where are you going?\nOutside.\nYou can't go out there.\nWhy not?\nBecause of... the reason.\nAnd that would be?\nI, um, can't tell you.\nJoey, what's going on?\nOK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.\nAbout what?\nHe's planning your birthday party.\nOh my God! I love him!\nYou'd better act surprised.\nAbout what?\nMy surprise party!\nWhat surprise party?\nOh stop it. Joey already told me.\nWell, he didn't tell me.\nHey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.\nThis is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.\nNo, you are not. We tell you stuff.\nYuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.\nHmmm... this is so nice.\nOK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.\nOK.\nOK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....\nOhhh!!!!\nYes, yes, that's right...\nOh, look at the little cat!\nWhat? Ow!\nI'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...\nThis is just Bactine. It won't hurt.\nSorry, that was wax.\nOh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.\nWhy don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?\nDuring a blackout? He'd get trampled!\nYeah?\nYou know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.\nOh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?\nOh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.\nEr, yeah, it's mine.\nHe seems to hate you. Are you sure?\nYeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.\nWait a minute. What's his name?\nEhhhh... B-Buttons.\nBob Buttons?\nMmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.\nOooh! You are a very bad man!\nYou owe me a cat.\nHere, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...\nWow.\nLucky sixes....\nEverybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.\nHi!\nAnd Joey....\nHi!\nAnd Ross.\nHi!\nHe doesn't speak much English.\nMonopoly!\nLook at that!\nSo, um... where did Paolo come from?\nOh... Italy, I think.\nNo, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.\nWell, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!\nThat, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.\nAlright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.\nOh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.\nAh! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.\nAh, Paolo, this is Phoebe.\nYou betcha!\nAh, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.\nNice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.\nGood save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.\nAre you alright?\nMy God, you're choking! That better?\nYes... thank you. That was... that was....\nPerfection?\nBlah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....\nWha-What did he say that was so funny?\nI have absolutely no idea.\nThat's... that's classic.\nOh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!\nIf you want, I'll do it.\nI know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.\nGod, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.\nYou know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.\nY'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....\nPaolo. Hi.\nRoss!\nListen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.\nThing?\nThing, yes. Thing.\nAh, you... have the sex?\nNo, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...\nBed?\nNo, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.\nOh!\nYeah! Se vice?\nSi.\nSo you do know a little English.\nPoco... a leetle.\nDo you know the word crapweasel?\nNo.\nThat's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!\nChandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.\nOK.\nReady?\nNo, you've got to whip it.\nOh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...\nThank you.\nThanks.\nKinda... spooky without any lights.\nBwah-hah-hah!\nOK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...\nOh.. oh... oh.\nHey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.\nWell, this has been fun.\nYes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.\nWell, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.\nHi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.\n","\nIt is a Saturday afternoon of blue and yellow autumn time, and the scene\nis the High Street of a well-known market-town.  A large carrier's van\nstands in the quadrangular fore-court of the White Hart Inn, upon the\nsides of its spacious tilt being painted, in weather-beaten letters:\n'Burthen, Carrier to Longpuddle.'  These vans, so numerous hereabout, are\na respectable, if somewhat lumbering, class of conveyance, much resorted\nto by decent travellers not overstocked with money, the better among them\nroughly corresponding to the old French _diligences_.\n\nThe present one is timed to leave the town at four in the afternoon\nprecisely, and it is now half-past three by the clock in the turret at\nthe top of the street.  In a few seconds errand-boys from the shops begin\nto arrive with packages, which they fling into the vehicle, and turn away\nwhistling, and care for the packages no more.  At twenty minutes to four\nan elderly woman places her basket upon the shafts, slowly mounts, takes\nup a seat inside, and folds her hands and her lips.  She has secured her\ncorner for the journey, though there is as yet no sign of a horse being\nput in, nor of a carrier.  At the three-quarters, two other women arrive,\nin whom the first recognizes the postmistress of Upper Longpuddle and the\nregistrar's wife, they recognizing her as the aged groceress of the same\nvillage.  At five minutes to the hour there approach Mr. Profitt, the\nschoolmaster, in a soft felt hat, and Christopher Twink, the\nmaster-thatcher; and as the hour strikes there rapidly drop in the parish\nclerk and his wife, the seedsman and his aged father, the registrar; also\nMr. Day, the world-ignored local landscape-painter, an elderly man who\nresides in his native place, and has never sold a picture outside it,\nthough his pretensions to art have been nobly supported by his fellow-\nvillagers, whose confidence in his genius has been as remarkable as the\nouter neglect of it, leading them to buy his paintings so extensively (at\nthe price of a few shillings each, it is true) that every dwelling in the\nparish exhibits three or four of those admired productions on its walls.\n\nBurthen, the carrier, is by this time seen bustling round the vehicle;\nthe horses are put in, the proprietor arranges the reins and springs up\ninto his seat as if he were used to it--which he is.\n\n'Is everybody here?' he asks preparatorily over his shoulder to the\npassengers within.\n\nAs those who were not there did not reply in the negative the muster was\nassumed to be complete, and after a few hitches and hindrances the van\nwith its human freight was got under way.  It jogged on at an easy pace\ntill it reached the bridge which formed the last outpost of the town.  The\ncarrier pulled up suddenly.\n\n'Bless my soul!' he said, 'I've forgot the curate!'\n\nAll who could do so gazed from the little back window of the van, but the\ncurate was not in sight.\n\n'Now I wonder where that there man is?' continued the carrier.\n\n'Poor man, he ought to have a living at his time of life.'\n\n'And he ought to be punctual,' said the carrier.  '\"Four o'clock sharp is\nmy time for starting,\" I said to 'en.  And he said, \"I'll be there.\"  Now\nhe's not here, and as a serious old church-minister he ought to be as\ngood as his word.  Perhaps Mr. Flaxton knows, being in the same line of\nlife?'  He turned to the parish clerk.\n\n'I was talking an immense deal with him, that's true, half an hour ago,'\nreplied that ecclesiastic, as one of whom it was no erroneous supposition\nthat he should be on intimate terms with another of the cloth.  'But he\ndidn't say he would be late.'\n\nThe discussion was cut off by the appearance round the corner of the van\nof rays from the curate's spectacles, followed hastily by his face and a\nfew white whiskers, and the swinging tails of his long gaunt coat.  Nobody\nreproached him, seeing how he was reproaching himself; and he entered\nbreathlessly and took his seat.\n\n'Now be we all here?' said the carrier again.  They started a second\ntime, and moved on till they were about three hundred yards out of the\ntown, and had nearly reached the second bridge, behind which, as every\nnative remembers, the road takes a turn and travellers by this highway\ndisappear finally from the view of gazing burghers.\n\n'Well, as I'm alive!' cried the postmistress from the interior of the\nconveyance, peering through the little square back-window along the road\ntownward.\n\n'What?' said the carrier.\n\n'A man hailing us!'\n\nAnother sudden stoppage.  'Somebody else?' the carrier asked.\n\n'Ay, sure!'  All waited silently, while those who could gaze out did so.\n\n'Now, who can that be?' Burthen continued.  'I just put it to ye,\nneighbours, can any man keep time with such hindrances?  Bain't we full\na'ready?  Who in the world can the man be?'\n\n'He's a sort of gentleman,' said the schoolmaster, his position\ncommanding the road more comfortably than that of his comrades.\n\nThe stranger, who had been holding up his umbrella to attract their\nnotice, was walking forward leisurely enough, now that he found, by their\nstopping, that it had been secured.  His clothes were decidedly not of a\nlocal cut, though it was difficult to point out any particular mark of\ndifference.  In his left hand he carried a small leather travelling bag.\nAs soon as he had overtaken the van he glanced at the inscription on its\nside, as if to assure himself that he had hailed the right conveyance,\nand asked if they had room.\n\nThe carrier replied that though they were pretty well laden he supposed\nthey could carry one more, whereupon the stranger mounted, and took the\nseat cleared for him within.  And then the horses made another move, this\ntime for good, and swung along with their burden of fourteen souls all\ntold.\n\n'You bain't one of these parts, sir?' said the carrier.  'I could tell\nthat as far as I could see 'ee.'\n\n'Yes, I am one of these parts,' said the stranger.\n\n'Oh?  H'm.'\n\nThe silence which followed seemed to imply a doubt of the truth of the\nnew-comer's assertion.  'I was speaking of Upper Longpuddle more\nparticular,' continued the carrier hardily, 'and I think I know most\nfaces of that valley.'\n\n'I was born at Longpuddle, and nursed at Longpuddle, and my father and\ngrandfather before me,' said the passenger quietly.\n\n'Why, to be sure,' said the aged groceress in the background, 'it isn't\nJohn Lackland's son--never--it can't be--he who went to foreign parts\nfive-and-thirty years ago with his wife and family?  Yet--what do I\nhear?--that's his father's voice!'\n\n'That's the man,' replied the stranger.  'John Lackland was my father,\nand I am John Lackland's son.  Five-and-thirty years ago, when I was a\nboy of eleven, my parents emigrated across the seas, taking me and my\nsister with them.  Kytes's boy Tony was the one who drove us and our\nbelongings to Casterbridge on the morning we left; and his was the last\nLongpuddle face I saw.  We sailed the same week across the ocean, and\nthere we've been ever since, and there I've left those I went with--all\nthree.'\n\n'Alive or dead?'\n\n'Dead,' he replied in a low voice.  'And I have come back to the old\nplace, having nourished a thought--not a definite intention, but just a\nthought--that I should like to return here in a year or two, to spend the\nremainder of my days.'\n\n'Married man, Mr. Lackland?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'And have the world used 'ee well, sir--or rather John, knowing 'ee as a\nchild?  In these rich new countries that we hear of so much, you've got\nrich with the rest?'\n\n'I am not very rich,' Mr. Lackland said.  'Even in new countries, you\nknow, there are failures.  The race is not always to the swift, nor the\nbattle to the strong; and even if it sometimes is, you may be neither\nswift nor strong.  However, that's enough about me.  Now, having answered\nyour inquiries, you must answer mine; for being in London, I have come\ndown here entirely to discover what Longpuddle is looking like, and who\nare living there.  That was why I preferred a seat in your van to hiring\na carriage for driving across.'\n\n'Well, as for Longpuddle, we rub on there much as usual.  Old figures\nhave dropped out o' their frames, so to speak it, and new ones have been\nput in their places.  You mentioned Tony Kytes as having been the one to\ndrive your family and your goods to Casterbridge in his father's waggon\nwhen you left.  Tony is, I believe, living still, but not at Longpuddle.\nHe went away and settled at Lewgate, near Mellstock, after his marriage.\nAh, Tony was a sort o' man!'\n\n'His character had hardly come out when I knew him.'\n\n'No.  But 'twas well enough, as far as that goes--except as to women.  I\nshall never forget his courting--never!'\n\nThe returned villager waited silently, and the carrier went on:--\n\n","Hey guys!\nHey!\nHoney, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.\nThat place in Vermont? You can take  a hint!\nWait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!\nYeah!\nWe're having a party.\nWell, can't you just have the party when we get back?\nNo.\nNo,  that day... that won't be her real birthday!\nGee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday  was!\nC'mon you guys, this is really important to us.\nWell, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away.  You know, to reconnect... emotionally.\nThere's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...\nWell, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?\nYeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing  weird sex stuff to my little sister.\nAnd I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can  we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!\nAll right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.\nFine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this  party...\nBelieve me, that is not why we won't  be doing that!\nYou know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would  hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure  map to help me find 'em all.\nOooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm...  when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood  to buy us food!\nHey guys!\nHi!\nHey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.\nOh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma  and we'll give it to her when she is 18.\nOh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!\nYeah!\nOh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't  even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And  they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant  people!\nThat's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?\nOh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.\nAh, and where is Joey?\nI said it's still nap time.\nHey, there is uncle Joey!\nHey!\nHey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!\n18, uh?   Ross: Joey, NO!\nWhat, what!? it's for her hot friends!\nWhen they see this you'll be 52!\nAnd starting to think about settling down!\nHey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents  on?\nI'd love to! Yeah!   Joey: We were supposed to bring presents?\nYeah! I wrote Emma a song.\nOh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?\nJoey, it's a birthday party.\nYeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed  for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as  a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says \"El-moo\"!  Yeah... that's a funny cup!\nHey!\nHey hey! Where's the birthday girl?\nOh, she's still napping\nOh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party  she knows is happening.\nLook, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't  a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a  first birthday again.\nAll right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and  get the fun time started!\nNo really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.\nAre you freaking kidding me, Green?\nJack and Judy: HI!\nHey!\nSo glad you came!\nI can't believe Emma is already one!\nThere's something you didn't know  about your dad!\nHey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.\nThank you!\nOh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what  would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!\nWhich one are you?\nI can't believe Emma is still asleep!\nI know, what are we gonna do?\nI've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really  hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!\nI'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!\nHey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song,  maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!   So you’re gonna... hit on her?\nNo, no, no! My talents as an actor!\nOh!\nYou know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one  of her books!\nOr you could stick a fork in an apple!\nHey, I think Emma might like it!\nOh! Emma might like what?\nUm, my present!\nWhat did you get her?\nActually we prepared performances.\nSeparate performances.\nBut equally real!\nWell, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are  getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind  performing them once now?\nSure, yeah!\nO K.\nAll right, let’s get this party started, huh?  Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.\nOh, great!\nAre you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing  prepared?\nHey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole  crew waiting!\nSo, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?\nI will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.\nOh, ok, which one?\nUh, why, it’s a... .  And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll  like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”.\nWow! That was amazing!\nThank you so much for that gift!\nI was not ready for this today!\nAmazing... amazing.\nOh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.\nThat’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to  hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music. Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma!  Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy  birthday Emma!\nIs that it?\nNo, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading Finding your G-spot.\nNo, no, no, no, no!\nHello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.\nRight now that seems so far away, seventeen years.\nYes, you’ll be all grown up by then. We’ll be... Well your  grandfather and I might not be here.\nThat’s true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the  grave, Emma!\nAfter all, my parents died very young.\nAnd my cholesterol’s off the charts!\nRemember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!\nOk, cut! Great. That was... that was  just... yeah!\nRoss, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s  in a box in the fridge.\nSure.\nOh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey,  Corino’s.\nOh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike  there when I was a kid.\nWell, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different  shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!\nOh, did you do a picture of Emma?\nYes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.\nUh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say  for bachelorette parties?\nRoss, what are you talking about? oh! Oh my God!  They put my baby’s face on a penis!\noh! Now it’s a party!\nWhy you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to  be a disaster I would have baked it myself!\nUh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?\nJack, look at this.\nI know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!\nI am this close to tugging on my testicles again.\nNo, no, this is not what I ordered.  Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for  my daughter’s birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!\nAsk them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the  penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!\nOh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even  want it in my home... Joey, don't touch it!!\nI'm so confused!\nYes, yes. I still want  my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with  nuts!\nTo be fair this one does have nuts.\nHey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could  go and get the cake.\nOh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!\nWell, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message  to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok!\nHi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?\nWe're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way.  You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!\nWe used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together  and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.\nRoss, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to  go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in  a half hour.\nAnd you know, I have a massage client soon.\nYou guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be  back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?\nAlright, 5 more minutes.Was that Emma? Is she up?\nNo, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot  her licence so now I have to bring it to her.\nWell, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.\nNo! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us  We've been complaining the longest!\nNo, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad  that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes  back here and all you guys are gone?\nI don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!\nJoey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!\nGot it! Where do you think you're going?\nTo the bathroom!\nAlright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna  be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!\nOh no! He's not getting away that easy!Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.\nNo, it did not.\nNo.\nWell, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at  night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.\nLast winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger  scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.\nAnyway, it was lovely seeing you.\nOk!\nBye... Bye dear.\nNighty-night!\nNighty-night!\nBye, bye.\nJoey? How could you just let them leave?\nHey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he  fought for our country.\nNo, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.\nYou do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?\nOh! I forgot you used to live here!\nHello?\nJoey! It's Estelle!\nHey!\nSo, how did your audition go today?\nWhat audition?\nThe one I told you about last week?\nWhat? You never said anything about an audition!\nLet me start over. I just got a call about an audition.  I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to  have a monologue prepared.\nA monologue? I don't have..  Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!\nWh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client  waiting outside my door any minute!\nYeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right  now!\nWell, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as  the person who realized that, I get to go!\nNo! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.\nOh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever  gets the highest number gets to go first.\nOk, ten.\nOkay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?\nNo, lets just draw straws.\nOr.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..\nI'm begging you stop.\nRight.\nOk, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday.  We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!\nYeah!! Let's do that!\nThat sounds more fun than the thing we were going  to do in Vermont!\nEverybody get your toys!\nOk! I want the dolphin!\nThats a bear.\nI'm too excited!\nPhoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler  and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. Now the one who comes  in last, stays!\nOk, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!\nOk, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!\nGo! Go!\nCome on robot!\nWhat are you barking at?\nWha... How the hell is that gonna help?\nI bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?\nWay to go robot!\nGood job Alan!\nHey, good race you guys.\nYeah, see you later!\nNo! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. The rules clearly  stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog  never crossed the finish line, so technically...\nThey left.\nBye...\nRACHEL!\nOOH! God! Sorry!\nI can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a  good driver.\nEmma's awake.\nYeah?\nI can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're  not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.\nHey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.\nOh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday...  And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According  to the back cover of that book that you gave me.\nRach, she's not going to remember this.\nThey have to learn!\nHey!\nWhat?\nIt's not bad.\nOh my God! Look what... you made it into a  bunny. How did you do that?\nWell, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this  to make ears.\nWell, I'm very impressed.\nSome can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into  woodland creatures.\nNow another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.\nI'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?\nGame?\nEmma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old,  that's little.\nOoh! That's my girl!\nThat's how old you are.\nDid I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?\nOoh, I want one...\nMe too...\nThere's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?\n...and head to Canada!\nI was kidding.\nI wasn't. Let's get going!\nHey, are Ross and Rachel back?\nNo, not yet.\nOh good, I didn't miss the party.\nWhat about your massage client?\nI just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something,  you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.\nOkay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE  TIME!\nI've been here the whole time!\nJoey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.\nI don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks  you guys!\nHey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.\nWhat?\nEmma, how old are you? How old are you today?\nWo-ish.\nOh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!\nOh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...\nNO, no science camp!\nDamnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.\nOh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!\nThanks!\nOkay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow  out the candle. Come on Emma.\nLet's do it, come on!\nWhat's wrong? Are you okay?\nOh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.\nHey, you made it into a bunny.\nWhat is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it  was a penis.\nOkay.\nOkay, you ready?\nYeah.\nA-a-and... record.\nOkay. Hi Emma. Well,  your first birthday is over, and it was really...\nGo, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard!\n","\n'William, as you may know, was a curious, silent man; you could feel when\nhe came near 'ee; and if he was in the house or anywhere behind your back\nwithout your seeing him, there seemed to be something clammy in the air,\nas if a cellar door was opened close by your elbow.  Well, one Sunday, at\na time that William was in very good health to all appearance, the bell\nthat was ringing for church went very heavy all of a sudden; the sexton,\nwho told me o't, said he'd not known the bell go so heavy in his hand for\nyears--it was just as if the gudgeons wanted oiling.  That was on the\nSunday, as I say.  During the week after, it chanced that William's wife\nwas staying up late one night to finish her ironing, she doing the\nwashing for Mr. and Mrs. Hardcome.  Her husband had finished his supper\nand gone to bed as usual some hour or two before.  While she ironed she\nheard him coming down stairs; he stopped to put on his boots at the stair-\nfoot, where he always left them, and then came on into the living-room\nwhere she was ironing, passing through it towards the door, this being\nthe only way from the staircase to the outside of the house.  No word was\nsaid on either side, William not being a man given to much speaking, and\nhis wife being occupied with her work.  He went out and closed the door\nbehind him.  As her husband had now and then gone out in this way at\nnight before when unwell, or unable to sleep for want of a pipe, she took\nno particular notice, and continued at her ironing.  This she finished\nshortly after, and as he had not come in she waited awhile for him,\nputting away the irons and things, and preparing the table for his\nbreakfast in the morning.  Still he did not return, but supposing him not\nfar off, and wanting to get to bed herself, tired as she was, she left\nthe door unbarred and went to the stairs, after writing on the back of\nthe door with chalk: _Mind and do the door_ (because he was a forgetful\nman).\n\n'To her great surprise, and I might say alarm, on reaching the foot of\nthe stairs his boots were standing there as they always stood when he had\ngone to rest; going up to their chamber she found him in bed sleeping as\nsound as a rock.  How he could have got back again without her seeing or\nhearing him was beyond her comprehension.  It could only have been by\npassing behind her very quietly while she was bumping with the iron.  But\nthis notion did not satisfy her: it was surely impossible that she should\nnot have seen him come in through a room so small.  She could not unravel\nthe mystery, and felt very queer and uncomfortable about it.  However,\nshe would not disturb him to question him then, and went to bed herself.\n\n'He rose and left for his work very early the next morning, before she\nwas awake, and she waited his return to breakfast with much anxiety for\nan explanation, for thinking over the matter by daylight made it seem\nonly the more startling.  When he came in to the meal he said, before she\ncould put her question, \"What's the meaning of them words chalked on the\ndoor?\"\n\n'She told him, and asked him about his going out the night before.\nWilliam declared that he had never left the bedroom after entering it,\nhaving in fact undressed, lain down, and fallen asleep directly, never\nonce waking till the clock struck five, and he rose up to go to his\nlabour.\n\n'Betty Privett was as certain in her own mind that he did go out as she\nwas of her own existence, and was little less certain that he did not\nreturn.  She felt too disturbed to argue with him, and let the subject\ndrop as though she must have been mistaken.  When she was walking down\nLongpuddle street later in the day she met Jim Weedle's daughter Nancy,\nand said, \"Well, Nancy, you do look sleepy to-day!\"\n\n'\"Yes, Mrs. Privett,\" says Nancy.  \"Now don't tell anybody, but I don't\nmind letting you know what the reason o't is.  Last night, being Old\nMidsummer Eve, some of us went to church porch, and didn't get home till\nnear one.\"\n\n'\"Did ye?\" says Mrs. Privett.  \"Old Midsummer yesterday was it?  Faith I\ndidn't think whe'r 'twas Midsummer or Michaelmas; I'd too much work to\ndo.\"\n\n'\"Yes.  And we were frightened enough, I can tell 'ee, by what we saw.\"\n\n'\"What did ye see?\"\n\n'(You may not remember, sir, having gone off to foreign parts so young,\nthat on Midsummer Night it is believed hereabout that the faint shapes of\nall the folk in the parish who are going to be at death's door within the\nyear can be seen entering the church.  Those who get over their illness\ncome out again after a while; those that are doomed to die do not\nreturn.)\n\n'\"What did you see?\" asked William's wife.\n\n'\"Well,\" says Nancy, backwardly--\"we needn't tell what we saw, or who we\nsaw.\"\n\n'\"You saw my husband,\" says Betty Privett, in a quiet way.\n\n'\"Well, since you put it so,\" says Nancy, hanging fire, \"we--thought we\ndid see him; but it was darkish, and we was frightened, and of course it\nmight not have been he.\"\n\n'\"Nancy, you needn't mind letting it out, though 'tis kept back in\nkindness.  And he didn't come out of church again: I know it as well as\nyou.\"\n\n'Nancy did not answer yes or no to that, and no more was said.  But three\ndays after, William Privett was mowing with John Chiles in Mr. Hardcome's\nmeadow, and in the heat of the day they sat down to eat their bit o'\nnunch under a tree, and empty their flagon.  Afterwards both of 'em fell\nasleep as they sat.  John Chiles was the first to wake, and as he looked\ntowards his fellow-mower he saw one of those great white miller's-souls\nas we call 'em--that is to say, a miller-moth--come from William's open\nmouth while he slept, and fly straight away.  John thought it odd enough,\nas William had worked in a mill for several years when he was a boy.  He\nthen looked at the sun, and found by the place o't that they had slept a\nlong while, and as William did not wake, John called to him and said it\nwas high time to begin work again.  He took no notice, and then John went\nup and shook him, and found he was dead.\n\n'Now on that very day old Philip Hookhorn was down at Longpuddle Spring\ndipping up a pitcher of water; and as he turned away, who should he see\ncoming down to the spring on the other side but William, looking very\npale and odd.  This surprised Philip Hookhorn very much, for years before\nthat time William's little son--his only child--had been drowned in that\nspring while at play there, and this had so preyed upon William's mind\nthat he'd never been seen near the spring afterwards, and had been known\nto go half a mile out of his way to avoid the place.  On inquiry, it was\nfound that William in body could not have stood by the spring, being in\nthe mead two miles off; and it also came out that the time at which he\nwas seen at the spring was the very time when he died.'\n\n* * * * *\n\n'A rather melancholy story,' observed the emigrant, after a minute's\nsilence.\n\n'Yes, yes.  Well, we must take ups and downs together,' said the\nseedsman's father.\n\n'You don't know, Mr. Lackland, I suppose, what a rum start that was\nbetween Andrey Satchel and Jane Vallens and the pa'son and clerk o'\nScrimpton?' said the master-thatcher, a man with a spark of subdued\nliveliness in his eye, who had hitherto kept his attention mainly upon\nsmall objects a long way ahead, as he sat in front of the van with his\nfeet outside.  'Theirs was a queerer experience of a pa'son and clerk\nthan some folks get, and may cheer 'ee up a little after this dampness\nthat's been flung over yer soul.'\n\nThe returned one replied that he knew nothing of the history, and should\nbe happy to hear it, quite recollecting the personality of the man\nSatchel.\n\n'Ah no; this Andrey Satchel is the son of the Satchel that you knew; this\none has not been married more than two or three years, and 'twas at the\ntime o' the wedding that the accident happened that I could tell 'ee of,\nor anybody else here, for that matter.'\n\n'No, no; you must tell it, neighbour, if anybody,' said several; a\nrequest in which Mr. Lackland joined, adding that the Satchel family was\none he had known well before leaving home.\n\n'I'll just mention, as you be a stranger,' whispered the carrier to\nLackland, 'that Christopher's stories will bear pruning.'\n\nThe emigrant nodded.\n\n'Well, I can soon tell it,' said the master-thatcher, schooling himself\nto a tone of actuality.  'Though as it has more to do with the pa'son and\nclerk than with Andrey himself, it ought to be told by a better churchman\nthan I.'\n\n","\nWell, I have received much encouragement to relate my experiences on Ecstasy, so here is an attempt...\n\nI was told almost a week in advance that I might have the opportunity to try Ecstasy with the young lady who acted as a guide for my first LSD trip. We were to meet at a given tube station not far from the nightclub where the experimentation would take place.\n\nI was not easy about trying a new psychedelic in a crowded place, realizing this could have been difficult to handle with LSD. But there lay the opportunity and I just hoped to have enough mental control (practice of Yoga helping) if things got tight.\n\nI had read about MDMA in Peter Stafford's Psychedelics Encyclopaedia, but was aware E's are not very often pure MDMA. In addition, the book had stayed at home and my memory of its contents had faded somewhat. So I scanned the net for an Ecstasy FAQ and read that, also reading whatever current reports of the experience were posted on alt.drugs.\n\nQuite strangely, that was also the week my father decided to give me a hysterical account of some absurd and manipulatively badly written article in a Swiss newspaper depicting the dreadful and possessive evils of the Love Pill. He knows I have profound interest in altered consciousness and its chemical gateways, but not what I'm up to in my spare time...\n\nAnyway, I psyched myself up all week for the event, and when the Saturday evening came, I left a little note on my desk explaining that if I was unlucky that night, the Quest had been worth it.\n\nAs soon as we entered the nightclub, we went upstairs to the dance floor. An immense room with drapes hanging off all walls, a screen with a permanent slide of Planet Earth on it and countless balloons floating all around.\n\nSitting in a corner of the stage, I was handed my 2/3 of a White Dove pill. I insisted on chewing it to taste it - I wanted some intimate contact with the substance I was about to share my mind with. Tasted awful. Very chemical. That made me laugh, especially looking at the face of my companion who had agreed to bite into it too. We washed the taste down with gulps from the traditional raver's water bottle, as our supplier explained to us a few of the basics and possible initial effects.\n\n'If you feel funny, get up and dance.' she had said.\n\nSure enough, about 25 minutes later, I was feeling slightly uncomfortable. Stomach ? Mind ? I wasn't sure. From feeling quite talkative I went to being rather silent and reserved. So I got up and began to jiggle about. That felt a whole lot better.\n\nI was soon joined by the other Ecstasy-newbie who commented that nothing was happening to her.\n\n'I feel weird', I said.\n\n'Keep dancing' our supplier repeated, she too waiting for her E to kick in.\n\nMinutes later I experienced a rush to the head - I felt for a few seconds that I was really going to lose it, and had a vision of myself huddled in a corner, crying for hours. Damn, just my luck I thought, a bad trip on the first one. I literally felt as if my mind was going to black out. No way, I thought, no way. My dad talks WOsD propaganda and I'm not having a bad trip. I quickly searched for my companions on the stage and got closer to them. I danced more energetically, trying to get into the music.\n\nSeconds later a most unbelievable surge of energy and gentle warmth rushed through my body. It was so brutally intense, all I could do for several minutes was inhale and let the breath come out as one long howl of indescriptible joy. Many around me joined in. It seemed as though half the stage was just hollering in joint ecstasy.\n\nEcstasy. The perfect word. No other could have described what I was experiencing right then and there. Beyond words. The entire message was contained in a scream and the most intense smile my face had displayed in ages.\n\nOur supplier bounded up to us asking 'are you OK ? Have you eased up both of you ? You were rather tense'. I just grinned my face off.\n\n'I feel like hugging everybody' I shouted.\n\n'Then DO !' she yelled, flinging herself around my neck. Geez, that felt so GOOD ! Hugging was the most rewarding, comforting and uplifting experience ! This, for a person such as myself, usually quite conscious of personal space and physical contact with strangers, was a truly fascinating discovery.\n\nThe music too was surrounding me in trance-like comfort. The sound spoke to every nerve in my body. This is the synergy between dance, mind and rythmic signatures Terrence McKenna was on about, I thought. Wow. I could enjoy the 'Here and Now' - any time a thought of something unpleasant from the world would arise, I could look at it without stress, then gently push it out of my mind. It didn't matter that I had a project and exams. This state was pure, free, uninhibited.\n\nSpeaking to people in the chill-out room was bliss. I wanted everybody to be OK, I wanted to know their names, how many times they came here, what they were on... They were all so friendly.\n\nOne of them asked me 'You're all loved up, right ?'. I answered with the ecstatic grin. 'It's their first E' he was told. He then got up, opened his arms wide, and gave me a big hug. There was something so pure and brotherly about the whole atmosphere, it was overwhelming.\n\nI noticed all the described effects : brighter lights and colours, increased physical energy yet great calm, strong empathy and forgiveness for agressive behaviour, merging with the music to a trance state...\n\n'Beware of inappropriate emotional bonding', I had read. Damn, that's what held me back from interacting more fully with an unusually pretty girl who seemed to want to dance with me. As I noticed she was looking into my eyes and half turning to face me, I felt my heartbeat pound away. Another amazing wave of warmth shot up through my stomach to the top of my head. I felt my entire body vibrating with pleasure. I was on E and I was being turned on.\n\nI just looked into her eyes. I was confused by the intensity of the attraction, and uncertain how much of this was real. I needed a nod from a friend to go ahead, or something like that.\n\nThe nod never came. But I learned something really valuable there. Several years ago I got screwed up by a strong bondage with a girl. She moved away, and sure enough some predator attracted by her beauty seduced her. Though she chucked him away fast, that was the end for us. I had never been able to start another relationship with a girl since. I would miss any cue girls would send out to me, or even turn away from them, frightened. That Saturday night, Ecstasy cleared me from this emotional hangup. On the way down, I became introspective and meditative, and figured out what had been inhibiting me from falling in love again. This made me feel a great weight had just left my conscience, and I shared this feeling with friends immediately. I was once more free to love.\n\nSounds dramatic, I know. But this realization was deep, complete and liberating. LSD had freed my mind from some of its shackles, Ecstasy was freeing my feelings.\n\nThere would be so much more to say. But if you've read this far, I won't abuse your patience.\n\nWhat remains from the first experience is this emotional freedom, this feeling for Compassion (I now have a much better notion of what Buddha or Christ seemed to be preaching), and an increased ability to tune in to the structures and messages of music. On a more subtle level, I find it easier to initiate conversation with people and can cope better with aimless talk about this or that. I can also pick out almost anybody in a nightclub who is on E ! A real sharing and compassionate bunch - if a complete stranger happily offers you water, a spliff or a Vicks inhaler, I give you one guess as to what he's swallowed. Check the intense smile on his face, too.\n\nI have had only two more experiences with Ecstasy since.\n\nOn one occasion I met a really interesting group on the dance floor, winding up back at their place smoking spliff and playing video games, with a good bed for the night ! It also confirmed the return of my ability to interact with girls without hangups.\n\nOn the second occasion, I had twenty minutes of deeply mystical feeling ('I feel I'm talking to Jesus' I told my friend - this being from an agnostic). I also had a blinding moment in which I felt intensely how deeply important my friends are to me and how far beyond ordinary bonds our friendship goes.\n\nSo for whoever is going to try Ecstasy : aside from the usual drink-lots-of-water-and-wear-loose-clothing advice, prepare for times of howling beauty and buzzing interactions. Remember you can look at personal problems in a warm detached manner and maybe solve emotional history problems. And prepare for the ultimate experiences in dancing. \n\n","Madam Speaker, Vice President Biden, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:\n\nOur Constitution declares that from time to time, the President shall give to Congress information about the state of our union. For 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. They've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility. And they've done so in the midst of war and depression; at moments of great strife and great struggle.\n\nIt's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable -– that America was always destined to succeed. But when the Union was turned back at Bull Run, and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt. When the market crashed on Black Tuesday, and civil rights marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday, the future was anything but certain. These were the times that tested the courage of our convictions, and the strength of our union. And despite all our divisions and disagreements, our hesitations and our fears, America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one nation, as one people.\n\nAgain, we are tested. And again, we must answer history's call.\n\nOne year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt. Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression. So we acted -– immediately and aggressively. And one year later, the worst of the storm has passed.\n\nBut the devastation remains. One in 10 Americans still cannot find work. Many businesses have shuttered. Home values have declined. Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard. And for those who'd already known poverty, life has become that much harder.\n\nThis recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families have been dealing with for decades –- the burden of working harder and longer for less; of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college.\n\nSo I know the anxieties that are out there right now. They're not new. These struggles are the reason I ran for President. These struggles are what I've witnessed for years in places like Elkhart, Indiana; Galesburg, Illinois. I hear about them in the letters that I read each night. The toughest to read are those written by children -– asking why they have to move from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work.\n\nFor these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough. Some are frustrated; some are angry. They don't understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded, but hard work on Main Street isn't; or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems. They're tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness. They know we can't afford it. Not now.\n\nSo we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people hope -– what they deserve -– is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences; to overcome the numbing weight of our politics. For while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same. The aspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills; a chance to get ahead; most of all, the ability to give their children a better life.\n\nYou know what else they share? They share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity. After one of the most difficult years in our history, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids, starting businesses and going back to school. They're coaching Little League and helping their neighbors. One woman wrote to me and said, \"We are strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged.\"\n\nIt's because of this spirit -– this great decency and great strength -– that I have never been more hopeful about America's future than I am tonight. Despite our hardships, our union is strong. We do not give up. We do not quit. We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit. In this new decade, it's time the American people get a government that matches their decency; that embodies their strength. And tonight, tonight I'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.\n\nIt begins with our economy.\n\nOur most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis. It was not easy to do. And if there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout. I hated it -- I hated it. You hated it. It was about as popular as a root canal.\n\nBut when I ran for President, I promised I wouldn't just do what was popular -– I would do what was necessary. And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. More businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would have surely been lost.\n\nSo I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program. And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable. And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks. Most but not all.\n\nTo recover the rest, I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks. Now, I know Wall Street isn't keen on this idea. But if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need.\n\nNow, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans who had become unemployed.\n\nThat's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans; made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRA; and passed 25 different tax cuts.\n\nNow, let me repeat: We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. We cut taxes for small businesses. We cut taxes for first-time homebuyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college.\n\nI thought I'd get some applause on that one.\n\nAs a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. And we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person. Not a single dime.\n\nBecause of the steps we took, there are about two million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed. Two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy; 300,000 are teachers and other education workers. Tens of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, first responders. And we're on track to add another one and a half million jobs to this total by the end of the year.\n\nThe plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the Recovery Act. That's right -– the Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus bill. Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster. But you don't have to take their word for it. Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act. Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created. Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be laid off after all.\n\nThere are stories like this all across America. And after two years of recession, the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly some are starting to hire again.\n\nBut I realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from; who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response. That is why jobs must be our number-one focus in 2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight.\n\nNow, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's businesses. But government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers.\n\nWe should start where most new jobs do –- in small businesses, companies that begin when companies that begin when an entrepreneur -- when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, or a worker decides it's time she became her own boss. Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession and they're ready to grow. But when you talk to small businessowners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger companies. Financing remains difficult for small businessowners across the country, even those that are making a profit.\n\nSo tonight, I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat. I'm also proposing a new small business tax credit -– one that will go to over one million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages. While we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment, and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment.\n\nNext, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow. From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains, or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products.\n\nTomorrow, I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act. There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our nation's goods, services, and information.\n\nWe should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy-efficient, which supports clean energy jobs. And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas, and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America.\n\nNow, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps. As the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same, and I know they will. They will. People are out of work. They're hurting. They need our help. And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay.\n\nBut the truth is, these steps won't make up for the seven million jobs that we've lost over the last two years. The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth, and finally address the problems that America's families have confronted for years.\n\nWe can't afford another so-called economic \"expansion\" like the one from the last decade –- what some call the \"lost decade\" -– where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion; where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs; where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation.\n\nFrom the day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious; such an effort would be too contentious. I've been told that our political system is too gridlocked, and that we should just put things on hold for a while.\n\nFor those who make these claims, I have one simple question: How long should we wait? How long should America put its future on hold?\n\nYou see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse. Meanwhile, China is not waiting to revamp its economy. Germany is not waiting. India is not waiting. These nations -- they're not standing still. These nations aren't playing for second place. They're putting more emphasis on math and science. They're rebuilding their infrastructure. They're making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs. Well, I do not accept second place for the United States of America.\n\nAs hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth.\n\nNow, one place to start is serious financial reform. Look, I am not interested in punishing banks. I'm interested in protecting our economy. A strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes. But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy.\n\nWe need to make sure consumers and middle-class families have the information they need to make financial decisions. We can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy.\n\nNow, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes. And the lobbyists are trying to kill it. But we cannot let them win this fight. And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, I will send it back until we get it right. We've got to get it right.\n\nNext, we need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched. And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy. You can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy -– in the North Carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries; or in the California business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels.\n\nBut to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives. And that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country. It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development. It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies. And, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America.\n\nI am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year. And this year I'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate.\n\nI know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy. I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. But here's the thing -- even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy-efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future -– because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy. And America must be that nation.\n\nThird, we need to export more of our goods. Because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America. So tonight, we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next five years, an increase that will support two million jobs in America. To help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports, and reform export controls consistent with national security.\n\nWe have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are. If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores. But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules. And that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets, and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia.\n\nFourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people.\n\nNow, this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools. And the idea here is simple: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform -- reform that raises student achievement; inspires students to excel in math and science; and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural communities to the inner city. In the 21st century, the best anti-poverty program around is a world-class education. And in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential.\n\nWhen we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states. Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job. That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families.\n\nTo make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans. Instead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for four years of college and increase Pell Grants. And let's tell another one million students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years –- and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.\n\nAnd by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs because they, too, have a responsibility to help solve this problem.\n\nNow, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class. That's why last year I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle-class families. That's why we're nearly doubling the child care tax credit, and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg. That's why we're working to lift the value of a family's single largest investment –- their home. The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments.\n\nThis year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages. And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families that we still need health insurance reform. Yes, we do.\n\nNow, let's clear a few things up. I didn't choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt. And by now it should be fairly obvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good politics. I took on health care because of the stories I've heard from Americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage; patients who've been denied coverage; families –- even those with insurance -– who are just one illness away from financial ruin.\n\nAfter nearly a century of trying -- Democratic administrations, Republican administrations -- we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans. The approach we've taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry. It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market. It would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care.\n\nAnd by the way, I want to acknowledge our First Lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier. Thank you. She gets embarrassed.\n\nOur approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan. It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses. And according to the Congressional Budget Office -– the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress –- our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.\n\nStill, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became. I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people. And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, the process left most Americans wondering, \"What's in it for me?\"\n\nBut I also know this problem is not going away. By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance. Millions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow. Premiums will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. Small business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether. I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this chamber.\n\nSo, as temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the plan we've proposed. There's a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo. But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know. Let me know. Let me know. I'm eager to see it.\n\nHere's what I ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform. Not now. Not when we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people. Let's get it done. Let's get it done.\n\nNow, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. It's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve, and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing. So let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight.\n\nAt the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion. By the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program. On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget. All this was before I walked in the door.\n\nNow -- just stating the facts. Now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit. But we took office amid a crisis. And our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt. That, too, is a fact.\n\nI'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do. But families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal government should do the same. So tonight, I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year.\n\nStarting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years. Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will not be affected. But all other discretionary government programs will. Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't. And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will.\n\nWe will continue to go through the budget, line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work. We've already identified $20 billion in savings for next year. To help working families, we'll extend our middle-class tax cuts. But at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year. We just can't afford it.\n\nNow, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit we had when I took office. More importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to skyrocket. That's why I've called for a bipartisan fiscal commission, modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad. This can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solved a problem. The commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline.\n\nNow, yesterday, the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission. So I'll issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans. And when the vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.\n\nNow, I know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting. And I agree -- which is why this freeze won't take effect until next year when the economy is stronger. That's how budgeting works. But understand –- understand if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery -– all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes.\n\nFrom some on the right, I expect we'll hear a different argument -– that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts including those for the wealthier Americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away. The problem is that's what we did for eight years. That's what helped us into this crisis. It's what helped lead to these deficits. We can't do it again.\n\nRather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades, it's time to try something new. Let's invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt. Let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here. Let's try common sense. A novel concept.\n\nTo do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now. We face a deficit of trust -– deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years. To close that credibility gap we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue -- to end the outsized influence of lobbyists; to do our work openly; to give our people the government they deserve.\n\nThat's what I came to Washington to do. That's why -– for the first time in history –- my administration posts on our White House visitors online. That's why we've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs, or seats on federal boards and commissions.\n\nBut we can't stop there. It's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or with Congress. It's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office.\n\nWith all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests –- including foreign corporations –- to spend without limit in our elections. I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people. And I'd urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to correct some of these problems.\n\nI'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform. Democrats and Republicans. Democrats and Republicans. You've trimmed some of this spending, you've embraced some meaningful change. But restoring the public trust demands more. For example, some members of Congress post some earmark requests online. Tonight, I'm calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single Web site before there's a vote, so that the American people can see how their money is being spent.\n\nOf course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how we work with one another. Now, I'm not naïve. I never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony and some post-partisan era. I knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched. And on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. These disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, they've been taking place for over 200 years. They're the very essence of our democracy.\n\nBut what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day. We can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side -– a belief that if you lose, I win. Neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can. The confirmation of I'm speaking to both parties now. The confirmation of well-qualified public servants shouldn't be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual senators.\n\nWashington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game. But it's precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the American people. Worse yet, it's sowing further division among our citizens, further distrust in our government.\n\nSo, no, I will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics. I know it's an election year. And after last week, it's clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual. But we still need to govern.\n\nTo Democrats, I would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills. And if the Republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this town -- a supermajority -- then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well. Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it's not leadership. We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions. So let's show the American people that we can do it together.\n\nThis week, I'll be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans. I'd like to begin monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership. I know you can't wait.\n\nThroughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our security. Sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated. We can argue all we want about who's to blame for this, but I'm not interested in re-litigating the past. I know that all of us love this country. All of us are committed to its defense. So let's put aside the schoolyard taunts about who's tough. Let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values. Let's leave behind the fear and division, and do what it takes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future -- for America and for the world.\n\nThat's the work we began last year. Since the day I took office, we've renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation. We've made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take American lives. We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack, with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence. We've prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula. And in the last year, hundreds of al Qaeda's fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed -- far more than in 2008.\n\nAnd in Afghanistan, we're increasing our troops and training Afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011, and our troops can begin to come home. We will reward good governance, work to reduce corruption, and support the rights of all Afghans -- men and women alike. We're joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitments, and who will come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose. There will be difficult days ahead. But I am absolutely confident we will succeed.\n\nAs we take the fight to al Qaeda, we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its people. As a candidate, I promised that I would end this war, and that is what I am doing as President. We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August. We will support the Iraqi government -- we will support the Iraqi government as they hold elections, and we will continue to partner with the Iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity. But make no mistake: This war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home.\n\nTonight, all of our men and women in uniform -- in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and around the world –- they have to know that we -- that they have our respect, our gratitude, our full support. And just as they must have the resources they need in war, we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home. That's why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades -- last year. That's why we're building a 21st century VA. And that's why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families.\n\nNow, even as we prosecute two wars, we're also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the American people -– the threat of nuclear weapons. I've embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them. To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest-reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades. And at April's Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington, D.C. behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years, so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists.\n\nNow, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons. That's why North Korea now faces increased isolation, and stronger sanctions –- sanctions that are being vigorously enforced. That's why the international community is more united, and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated. And as Iran's leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt: They, too, will face growing consequences. That is a promise.\n\nThat's the leadership that we are providing –- engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people. We're working through the G20 to sustain a lasting global recovery. We're working with Muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation. We have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change. We're helping developing countries to feed themselves, and continuing the fight against HIV/AIDS. And we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease -– a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad.\n\nAs we have for over 60 years, America takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores. But we also do it because it is right. That's why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 Americans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild. That's why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan; why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran; why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in Guinea. For America must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity. Always.\n\nAbroad, America's greatest source of strength has always been our ideals. The same is true at home. We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution: the notion that we're all created equal; that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the law you should be protected by it; if you adhere to our common values you should be treated no different than anyone else.\n\nWe must continually renew this promise. My administration has a Civil Rights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination. We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate. This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are. It's the right thing to do.\n\nWe're going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws -– so that women get equal pay for an equal day's work. And we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system -– to secure our borders and enforce our laws, and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation.\n\nIn the end, it's our ideals, our values that built America -- values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe; values that drive our citizens still. Every day, Americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers. Time and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country. They take pride in their labor, and are generous in spirit. These aren't Republican values or Democratic values that they're living by; business values or labor values. They're American values.\n\nUnfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions -– our corporations, our media, and, yes, our government –- still reflect these same values. Each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper. But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure, or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people's doubts grow. Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up, we lose faith. The more that TV pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments, big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away.\n\nNo wonder there's so much cynicism out there. No wonder there's so much disappointment.\n\nI campaigned on the promise of change –- change we can believe in, the slogan went. And right now, I know there are many Americans who aren't sure if they still believe we can change –- or that I can deliver it.\n\nBut remember this –- I never suggested that change would be easy, or that I could do it alone. Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated. And when you try to do big things and make big changes, it stirs passions and controversy. That's just how it is.\n\nThose of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers. We can do what's necessary to keep our poll numbers high, and get through the next election instead of doing what's best for the next generation.\n\nBut I also know this: If people had made that decision 50 years ago, or 100 years ago, or 200 years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight. The only reason we are here is because generations of Americans were unafraid to do what was hard; to do what was needed even when success was uncertain; to do what it took to keep the dream of this nation alive for their children and their grandchildren.\n\nOur administration has had some political setbacks this year, and some of them were deserved. But I wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year. And what keeps me going -– what keeps me fighting -– is that despite all these setbacks, that spirit of determination and optimism, that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the American people, that lives on.\n\nIt lives on in the struggling small business owner who wrote to me of his company, \"None of us,\" he said, \"…are willing to consider, even slightly, that we might fail.\"\n\nIt lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession, \"We are strong. We are resilient. We are American.\"\n\nIt lives on in the 8-year-old boy in Louisiana, who just sent me his allowance and asked if I would give it to the people of Haiti.\n\nAnd it lives on in all the Americans who've dropped everything to go someplace they've never been and pull people they've never known from the rubble, prompting chants of \"U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A!\" when another life was saved.\n\nThe spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you, its people. We have finished a difficult year. We have come through a difficult decade. But a new year has come. A new decade stretches before us. We don't quit. I don't quit. Let's seize this moment -- to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more.\n\nThank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.\n","I took my love, I took it down, climbed a mountain and I turned around, and I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills 'til the landslide brought it down.\nOh, mirror in the sky, what is love?\nCan the child within my heart rise above?\nCan I sail through the changin' ocean tides?\nCan I handle the seasons of my life?\n\nWell, I've been afraid of changin' 'cause I've built my life around you.\nBut time makes you bolder even children get older, and I'm getting older, too.\n\nI took my love, I took it down, I climbed a mountain and I turned around and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills, well the landslide will bring it down.\nAnd if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills, well the landslide will bring it down.\nOh, the landslide will bring it down.\n\n","Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished citizens and fellow citizens: Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state of the union. This year, we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead.\nYou and I serve our country in a time of great consequence. During this session of Congress, we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our country; we have the opportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible disease. We will work for a prosperity that is broadly shared, and we will answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the American people.\nIn all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be confident. In a whirlwind of change and hope and peril, our faith is sure, our resolve is firm, and our union is strong.\nThis country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other presidents, and other generations. We will confront them with focus and clarity and courage.\nDuring the last two years, we have seen what can be accomplished when we work together. To lift the standards of our public schools, we achieved historic education reform — which must now be carried out in every school and in every classroom, so that every child in America can read and learn and succeed in life. To protect our country, we reorganized our government and created the Department of Homeland Security, which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era. To bring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation. To insist on integrity in American business we passed tough reforms, and we are holding corporate criminals to account.\nSome might call this a good record; I call it a good start. Tonight I ask the House and Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow citizens.\nOur first goal is clear: We must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job. After recession, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals and stock market declines, our economy is recovering — yet it's not growing fast enough, or strongly enough. With unemployment rising, our nation needs more small businesses to open, more companies to invest and expand, more employers to put up the sign that says, \"Help Wanted.\"\nJobs are created when the economy grows; the economy grows when Americans have more money to spend and invest; and the best and fairest way to make sure Americans have that money is not to tax it away in the first place.\nI am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made permanent and effective this year. And under my plan, as soon as I sign the bill, this extra money will start showing up in workers' paychecks. Instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty, we should do it now. Instead of slowly raising the child credit to $1,000, we should send the checks to American families now.\nThe tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes — and it will help our economy immediately: 92 million Americans will keep, this year, an average of almost $1,000 more of their own money. A family of four with an income of $40,000 would see their federal income taxes fall from $1,178 to $45 per year. Our plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small businesses.\nYou, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions, and promised them for future years. If this tax relief is good for Americans three, or five, or seven years from now, it is even better for Americans today.\nWe should also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax laws. It's fair to tax a company's profits. It is not fair to again tax the shareholder on the same profits. To boost investor confidence, and to help the nearly 10 million senior who receive dividend income, I ask you to end the unfair double taxation of dividends.\nLower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand. More jobs mean more taxpayers, and higher revenues to our government. The best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth, and to show some spending discipline in Washington, D.C.\nWe must work together to fund only our most important priorities. I will send you a budget that increases discretionary spending by 4 percent next year — about as much as the average family's income is expected to grow. And that is a good benchmark for us. Federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecks of American families.\nA growing economy and a focus on essential priorities will also be crucial to the future of Social Security. As we continue to work together to keep Social Security sound and reliable, we must offer younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will control and they will own.\nOur second goal is high quality, affordable health care for all Americans. The American system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation, with a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our lives. Yet for many people, medical care costs too much — and many have no coverage at all. These problems will not be solved with a nationalized health care system that dictates coverage and rations care.\nInstead, we must work toward a system in which all Americans have a good insurance policy, choose their own doctors, and seniors and low-income Americans receive the help they need. Instead of bureaucrats and trial lawyers and HMOs, we must put doctors and nurses and patients back in charge of American medicine.\nHealth care reform must begin with Medicare; Medicare is the binding commitment of a caring society. We must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to preventive medicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in America.\nSeniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just the way it is. And just like you — the members of Congress, and your staffs, and other federal employees — all seniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription drugs.\nMy budget will commit an additional $400 billion over the next decade to reform and strengthen Medicare. Leaders of both political parties have talked for years about strengthening Medicare. I urge the members of this new Congress to act this year.\nTo improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime causes of higher cost, the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued. Because of excessive litigation, everybody pays more for health care, and many parts of America are losing fine doctors. No one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit. I urge the Congress to pass medical liability reform.\nOur third goal is to promote energy independence for our country, while dramatically improving the environment. I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to develop cleaner technology, and to produce more energy at home. I have sent you Clear Skies legislation that mandates a 70-percent cut in air pollution from power plants over the next 15 years. I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative, to help prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities, kill wildlife, and burn away millions of acres of treasured forest.\nI urge you to pass these measures, for the good of both our environment and our economy. Even more, I ask you to take a crucial step and protect our environment in ways that generations before us could not have imagined.\nIn this century, the greatest environmental progress will come about not through endless lawsuits or command-and-control regulations, but through technology and innovation. Tonight I'm proposing $1.2 billion in research funding so that America can lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles.\nA single chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy, which can be used to power a car — producing only water, not exhaust fumes. With a new national commitment, our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom, so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen, and pollution-free.\nJoin me in this important innovation to make our air significantly cleaner, and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of energy.\nOur fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest problems of America. For so many in our country — the homeless and the fatherless, the addicted — the need is great. Yet there's power, wonder-working power, in the goodness and idealism and faith of the American people.\nAmericans are doing the work of compassion every day — visiting prisoners, providing shelter for battered women, bringing companionship to lonely seniors. These good works deserve our praise; they deserve our personal support; and when appropriate, they deserve the assistance of the federal government.\nI urge you to pass both my faith-based initiative and the Citizen Service Act, to encourage acts of compassion that can transform America, one heart and one soul at a time.\nLast year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in the USA Freedom Corps, which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across America. Tonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens — boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention, and children who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad.\nI propose a $450-million initiative to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners. Government will support the training and recruiting of mentors; yet it is the men and women of America who will fill the need. One mentor, one person can change a life forever. And I urge you to be that one person.\nAnother cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs. Addiction crowds out friendship, ambition, moral conviction, and reduces all the richness of life to a single destructive desire. As a government, we are fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies and reducing demand through anti-drug education programs. Yet for those already addicted, the fight against drugs is a fight for their own lives. Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it. So tonight I propose a new $600-million program to help an additional 300,000 Americans receive treatment over the next three years.\nOur nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work. One of them is found at the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A man in the program said, \"God does miracles in people's lives, and you never think it could be you.\" Tonight, let us bring to all Americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope: The miracle of recovery is possible, and it could be you.\nBy caring for children who need mentors, and for addicted men and women who need treatment, we are building a more welcoming society — a culture that values every life. And in this work we must not overlook the weakest among us. I ask you to protect infants at the very hour of their birth and end the practice of partial-birth abortion. And because no human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment, I ask you to set a high standard for humanity, and pass a law against all human cloning.\nThe qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America also determine our conduct abroad. The American flag stands for more than our power and our interests. Our founders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity, the rights of every person, and the possibilities of every life. This conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted, and defend the peace, and confound the designs of evil men.\nIn Afghanistan, we helped liberate an oppressed people. And we will continue helping them secure their country, rebuild their society, and educate all their children — boys and girls. In the Middle East, we will continue to seek peace between a secure Israel and a democratic Palestine. Across the Earth, America is feeding the hungry — more than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a gift from the people of the United States. As our nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer, we must also remember our calling as a blessed country is to make this world better.\nToday, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus — including 3 million children under the age 15. There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection. More than 4 million require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims — only 50,000 — are receiving the medicine they need.\nBecause the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration. He says, \"We have no medicines. Many hospitals tell people, you've got AIDS, we can't help you. Go home and die.\" In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words.\nAIDS can be prevented. Anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for many years. And the cost of those drugs has dropped from $12,000 a year to under $300 a year — which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp. Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many.\nWe have confronted, and will continue to confront, HIV/AIDS in our own country. And to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of Africa. This comprehensive plan will prevent 7 million new AIDS infections, treat at least 2 million people with life-extending drugs, and provide humane care for millions of people suffering from AIDS, and for children orphaned by AIDS.\nI ask the Congress to commit $15 billion over the next five years, including nearly $10 billion in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean.\nThis nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature. And this nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the man-made evil of international terrorism.\nThere are days when our fellow citizens do not hear news about the war on terror. There's never a day when I do not learn of another threat, or receive reports of operations in progress, or give an order in this global war against a scattered network of killers. The war goes on, and we are winning.\nTo date, we've arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of al Qaeda. They include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September the 11th attacks; the chief of al Qaeda operations in the Persian Gulf, who planned the bombings of our embassies in East Africa and the USS Cole; an al Qaeda operations chief from Southeast Asia; a former director of al Qaeda's training camps in Afghanistan; a key al Qaeda operative in Europe; a major al Qaeda leader in Yemen. All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries. Many others have met a different fate. Let's put it this way — they are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and allies.\nWe are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks. America and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the American embassy in Yemen, the American embassy in Singapore, a Saudi military base, ships in the Straits of Hormuz and the Straits the Gibraltar. We've broken al Qaeda cells in Hamburg, Milan, Madrid, London, Paris, as well as, Buffalo, New York.\nWe have the terrorists on the run. We're keeping them on the run. One by one, the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice.\nAs we fight this war, we will remember where it began — here, in our own country. This government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our homeland. We've intensified security at the borders and ports of entry, posted more than 50,000 newly-trained federal screeners in airports, begun inoculating troops and first responders against smallpox, and are deploying the nation's first early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack. And this year, for the first time, we are beginning to field a defense to protect this nation against ballistic missiles.\nI thank the Congress for supporting these measures. I ask you tonight to add to our future security with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bioterrorism, called Project Bioshield. The budget I send you will propose almost $6 billion to quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague. We must assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons, and we must act before the dangers are upon us.\nSince September the 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists. The FBI is improving its ability to analyze intelligence, and is transforming itself to meet new threats. Tonight, I am instructing the leaders of the FBI, the CIA, the Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center, to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location. Our government must have the very best information possible, and we will use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect all our citizens.\nOur war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is power. In the ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, on a field in Pennsylvania, this nation made a pledge, and we renew that pledge tonight: Whatever the duration of this struggle, and whatever the difficulties, we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men — free people will set the course of history.\nToday, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail, terror, and mass murder. They could also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies, who would use them without the least hesitation.\nThis threat is new; America's duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th century, small groups of men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals, and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world. In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States of America.\nNow, in this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared again, and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror. Once again, this nation and all our friends are all that stand between a world at peace, and a world of chaos and constant alarm. Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our people, and the hopes of all mankind. And we accept this responsibility.\nAmerica is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers. We have called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter and stand by its demand that Iraq disarm. We're strongly supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world. We're working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union, and to strengthen global treaties banning the production and shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction.\nIn all these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a process — it is to achieve a result: the end of terrible threats to the civilized world. All free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attacks. And we're asking them to join us, and many are doing so. Yet the course of this nation does not depend on the decisions of others. Whatever action is required, whenever action is necessary, I will defend the freedom and security of the American people.\nDifferent threats require different strategies. In Iran, we continue to see a government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and supports terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty and human rights and democracy. Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose their own government and determine their own destiny — and the United States supports their aspirations to live in freedom.\nOn the Korean Peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation. Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons. We now know that that regime was deceiving the world, and developing those weapons all along. And today the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions. America and the world will not be blackmailed.\nAmerica is working with the countries of the region — South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia — to find a peaceful solution, and to show the North Korean government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and continued hardship. The North Korean regime will find respect in the world and revival for its people only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions.\nOur nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States.\nTwelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost. To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction. For the next 12 years, he systematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, even while inspectors were in his country. Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons — not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities.\nAlmost three months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm. He has shown instead utter contempt for the United Nations, and for the opinion of the world. The 108 U.N. inspectors were sent to conduct — were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of California. The job of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime is disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy them as directed. Nothing like this has happened.\nThe United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax — enough doses to kill several million people. He hasn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it.\nThe United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin — enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure. He hadn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it.\nOur intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent. In such quantities, these chemical agents could also kill untold thousands. He's not accounted for these materials. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them.\nU.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them — despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them.\nFrom three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce germ warfare agents, and can be moved from place to a place to evade inspectors. Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities. He clearly has much to hide.\nThe dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary; he is deceiving. From intelligence sources we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the U.N. inspectors, sanitizing inspection sites and monitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses.\nIraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations. Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview. Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say. Intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with U.N. inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families.\nYear after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction. But why? The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack.\nWith nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create deadly havoc in that region. And this Congress and the America people must recognize another threat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of al Qaeda. Secretly, and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists, or help them develop their own.\nBefore September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans — this time armed by Saddam Hussein. It would take one vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known. We will do everything in our power to make sure that that day never comes.\nSome have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they strike? If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminations would come too late. Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an option.\nThe dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already used them on whole villages — leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind, or disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained — by torturing children while their parents are made to watch. International human rights groups have catalogued other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape. If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning.\nAnd tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is not surrounding your country — your enemy is ruling your country. And the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation.\nThe world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country, and our friends and our allies. The United States will ask the U.N. Security Council to convene on February the 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world. Secretary of State Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraqi's legal — Iraq's illegal weapons programs, its attempt to hide those weapons from inspectors, and its links to terrorist groups.\nWe will consult. But let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.\nTonight I have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace, members of the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling in or near the Middle East, and some crucial hours may lay ahead. In those hours, the success of our cause will depend on you. Your training has prepared you. Your honor will guide you. You believe in America, and America believes in you.\nSending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a President can make. The technologies of war have changed; the risks and suffering of war have not. For the brave Americans who bear the risk, no victory is free from sorrow. This nation fights reluctantly, because we know the cost and we dread the days of mourning that always come.\nWe seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be defended. A future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all. If war is forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just means — sparing, in every way we can, the innocent. And if war is forced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the United States military — and we will prevail.\nAnd as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring to the Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies — and freedom.\nMany challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season. In two years, America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril; from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes. And we go forward with confidence, because this call of history has come to the right country.\nAmericans are a resolute people who have risen to every test of our time. Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world and to ourselves. America is a strong nation, and honorable in the use of our strength. We exercise power without conquest, and we sacrifice for the liberty of strangers.\nAmericans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of every nation. The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world, it is God's gift to humanity.\nWe Americans have faith in ourselves, but not in ourselves alone. We do not know — we do not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving God behind all of life, and all of history.\nMay He guide us now. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.\n","Haha.. Which boss?","Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the 104th Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans all across our land: Let me begin tonight by saying to our men and women in uniform around the world, and especially those helping peace take root in Bosnia and to their families, I thank you. America is very, very proud of you.\nMy duty tonight is to report on the state of the Union, not the state of our Government but of our American community, and to set forth our responsibilities, in the words of our Founders, to form a more perfect Union.\nThe state of the Union is strong. Our economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades. We have the lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years. We have completed—created nearly 8 million new jobs, over a million of them in basic industries like construction and automobiles. America is selling more cars than Japan for the first time since the 1970's. And for 3 years in a row, we have had a record number of new businesses started in our country.\nOur leadership in the world is also strong, bringing hope for new peace. And perhaps most important, we are gaining ground in restoring our fundamental values. The crime rate, the welfare and food stamp rolls, the poverty rate, and the teen pregnancy rate are all down. And as they go down, prospects for America's future go up.\nWe live in an age of possibility. A hundred years ago we moved from farm to factory. Now we move to an age of technology, information, and global competition. These changes have opened vast new opportunities for our people, but they have also presented them with stiff challenges. While more Americans are living better, too many of our fellow citizens are working harder just to keep up, and they are rightly concerned about the security of their families.\nWe must answer here three fundamental questions: First, how do we make the American dream of opportunity for all a reality for all Americans who are willing to work for it? Second, how do we preserve our old and enduring values as we move into the future? And third, how do we meet these challenges together, as one America?\nWe know big Government does not have all the answers. We know there's not a program for every problem. We know, and we have worked to give the American people a smaller, less bureaucratic Government in Washington. And we have to give the American people one that lives within its means. The era of big Government is over. But we cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves.\nInstead, we must go forward as one America, one nation working together to meet the challenges we face together. Self-reliance and teamwork are not opposing virtues; we must have both. I believe our new, smaller Government must work in an old-fashioned American way, together with all of our citizens through State and local governments, in the workplace, in religious, charitable, and civic associations. Our goal must be to enable all our people to make the most of their own lives, with stronger families, more educational opportunity, economic security, safer streets, a cleaner environment in a safer world.\nTo improve the state of our Union, we must ask more of ourselves, we must expect more of each other, and we must face our challenges together.\nHere, in this place, our responsibility begins with balancing the budget in a way that is fair to all Americans. There is now broad bipartisan agreement that permanent deficit spending must come to an end.\nI compliment the Republican leadership and the membership for the energy and determination you have brought to this task of balancing the budget. And I thank the Democrats for passing the largest deficit reduction plan in history in 1993, which has already cut the deficit nearly in half in 3 years.\nSince 1993, we have all begun to see the benefits of deficit reduction. Lower interest rates have made it easier for businesses to borrow and to invest and to create new jobs. Lower interest rates have brought down the cost of home mortgages, car payments, and credit card rates to ordinary citizens. Now, it is time to finish the job and balance the budget.\nThough differences remain among us which are significant, the combined total of the proposed savings that are common to both plans is more than enough, using the numbers from your Congressional Budget Office to balance the budget in 7 years and to provide a modest tax cut.\nThese cuts are real. They will require sacrifice from everyone. But these cuts do not undermine our fundamental obligations to our parents, our children, and our future, by endangering Medicare or Medicaid or education or the environment or by raising taxes on working families.\nI have said before, and let me say again, many good ideas have come out of our negotiations. I have learned a lot about the way both Republicans and Democrats view the debate before us. I have learned a lot about the good ideas that each side has that we could all embrace.\nWe ought to resolve our remaining differences. I am willing to work to resolve them. I am ready to meet tomorrow. But I ask you to consider that we should at least enact these savings that both plans have in common and give the American people their balanced budget, a tax cut, lower interest rates, and a brighter future. We should do that now and make permanent deficits yesterday's legacy.\nNow it is time for us to look also to the challenges of today and tomorrow, beyond the burdens of yesterday. The challenges are significant. But our Nation was built on challenges. America was built on challenges, not promises. And when we work together to meet them, we never fail. That is the key to a more perfect Union. Our individual dreams must be realized by our common efforts.\nTonight I want to speak to you about the challenges we all face as a people. Our first challenge is to cherish our children and strengthen America's families. Family is the foundation of American life. If we have stronger families, we will have a stronger America.\nBefore I go on, I'd like to take just a moment to thank my own family, and to thank the person who has taught me more than anyone else over 25 years about the importance of families and children, a wonderful wife, a magnificent mother, and a great First Lady. Thank you, Hillary.\nAll strong families begin with taking more responsibility for our children. I've heard Mrs. Gore say that it's hard to be a parent today, but it's even harder to be a child. So all of us, not just as parents but all of us in our other roles—our media, our schools, our teachers, our communities, our churches and synagogues, our businesses, our governments—all of us have a responsibility to help our children to make it and to make the most of their lives and their God-given capacities.\nTo the media, I say you should create movies and CD's and television shows you'd want your own children and grandchildren to enjoy.\nI call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V-chip in TV sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for their children. When parents control what their young children see, that is not censorship; that is enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their children's upbringing. And I urge them to do it. The V-chip requirement is part of the important telecommunications bill now pending in this Congress. It has bipartisan support, and I urge you to pass it now.\nTo make the V-chip work, I challenge the broadcast industry to do what movies have done, to identify your program in ways that help parents to protect their children. And I invite the leaders of major media corporations in the entertainment industry to come to the White House next month to work with us in a positive way on concrete ways to improve what our children see on television. I am ready to work with you.\nI say to those who make and market cigarettes, every year a million children take up smoking, even though it's against the law. Three hundred thousand of them will have their lives shortened as a result. Our administration has taken steps to stop the massive marketing campaigns that appeal to our children. We are simply saying: Market your products to adults, if you wish, but draw the line on children.\nI say to those who are on welfare, and especially to those who have been trapped on welfare for a long time: For too long our welfare system has undermined the values of family and work, instead of supporting them. The Congress and I are near agreement on sweeping welfare reform. We agree on time limits, tough work requirements, and the toughest possible child support enforcement. But I believe we must also provide child care so that mothers who are required to go to work can do so without worrying about what is happening to their children.\nI challenge this Congress to send me a bipartisan welfare reform bill that will really move people from welfare to work and do the right thing by our children. I will sign it immediately.\nLet us be candid about this difficult problem. Passing a law, even the best possible law, is only a first step. The next step is to make it work. I challenge people on welfare to make the most of this opportunity for independence. I challenge American businesses to give people on welfare the chance to move into the work force. I applaud the work of religious groups and others who care for the poor. More than anyone else in our society, they know the true difficulty of the task before us, and they are in a position to help.\nEvery one of us should join them. That is the only way we can make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the American people.\nTo strengthen the family we must do everything we can to keep the teen pregnancy rate going down. I am gratified, as I'm sure all Americans are, that it has dropped for 2 years in a row. But we all know it is still far too high.\nTonight I am pleased to announce that a group of prominent Americans is responding to that challenge by forming an organization that will support grassroots community efforts all across our country in a national campaign against teen pregnancy. And I challenge all of us and every American to join their efforts.\nI call on American men and women in families to give greater respect to one another. We must end the deadly scourge of domestic violence in our country. And I challenge America's families to work harder to stay together. For families who stay together not only do better economically, their children do better as well.\nIn particular, I challenge the fathers of this country to love and care for their children. If your family has separated, you must pay your child support. We're doing more than ever to make sure you do, and we're going to do more. But let's all admit something about that, too: A check will not substitute for a parent's love and guidance. And only you—only you can make the decision to help raise your children. No matter who you are, how low or high your station in life, it is the most basic human duty of every American to do that job to the best of his or her ability.\nOur second challenge is to provide Americans with the educational opportunities we'll all need for this new century. In our schools, every classroom in America must be connected to the information superhighway, with computers and good software and well-trained teachers. We are working with the telecommunications industry, educators, and parents to connect 20 percent of California's classrooms by this spring, and every classroom and every library in the entire United States by the year 2000. I ask Congress to support this education technology initiative so that we can make sure this national partnership succeeds.\nEvery diploma ought to mean something. I challenge every community, every school, and every State to adopt national standards of excellence, to measure whether schools are meeting those standards, to cut bureaucratic redtape so that schools and teachers have more flexibility for grassroots reform, and to hold them accountable for results. That's what our Goals 2000 initiative is all about. I challenge every State to give all parents the right to choose which public school their children will attend, and to let teachers form new schools with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job.\nI challenge all our schools to teach character education, to teach good values and good citizenship. And if it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms.\nI challenge our parents to become their children's first teachers. Turn off the TV. See that the homework is done. And visit your children's classroom. No program, no teacher, no one else can do that for you.\nMy fellow Americans, higher education is more important today than ever before. We've created a new student loan program that's made it easier to borrow and repay those loans, and we have dramatically cut the student loan default rate. That's something we should all be proud of because it was unconscionably high just a few years ago.\nThrough AmeriCorps, our national service program, this year 25,000 young people will earn college money by serving their local communities to improve the lives of their friends and neighbors.\nThese initiatives are right for America, and we should keep them going. And we should also work hard to open the doors of college even wider. I challenge Congress to expand work-study and help one million young Americans work their way through college by the year 2000, to provide a $1,000 merit scholarship for the top 5 percent of graduates in every high school in the United States, to expand Pell Grant scholarships for deserving and needy students, and to make up to $10,000 a year of college tuition tax deductible. It's a good idea for America.\nOur third challenge is to help every American who is willing to work for it, achieve economic security in this new age. People who work hard still need support to get ahead in the new economy. They need education and training for a lifetime. They need more support for families raising children. They need retirement security. They need access to health care. More and more Americans are finding that the education of their childhood simply doesn't last a lifetime.\nSo I challenge Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping, antiquated job-training programs into a simple voucher worth $2,600 for unemployed or underemployed workers to use as they please for community college tuition or other training. This is a \"GI bill\" for America's workers we should all be able to agree on.\nMore and more Americans are working hard without a raise. Congress sets the minimum wage. Within a year, the minimum wage will fall to a 40-year low in purchasing power. Four dollars and 25 cents an hour is no longer a minimum wage, but millions of Americans and their children are trying to live on it. I challenge you to raise their minimum wage.\nIn 1993, Congress cut the taxes of 15 million hard-pressed working families to make sure that no parents who work full-time would have to raise their children in poverty and to encourage people to move from welfare to work. This expanded earned-income tax credit is now worth about $1,800 a year to a family of four living on $20,000. The budget bill I vetoed would have reversed this achievement and raised taxes on nearly 8 million of these people. We should not do that. We should not do that.\nI also agree that the people who are helped under this initiative are not all those in our country who are working hard to do a good job raising their children and at work. I agree that we need a tax credit for working families with children. That's one of the things most of us in this Chamber, I hope, can agree on. I know it is strongly supported by the Republican majority. And it should be part of any final budget agreement.\nI want to challenge every business that can possibly afford it to provide pensions for your employees. And I challenge Congress to pass a proposal recommended by the White House Conference on Small Business that would make it easier for small businesses and farmers to establish their own pension plans. That is something we should all agree on.\nWe should also protect existing pension plans. Two years ago, with bipartisan support that was almost unanimous on both sides of the aisle, we moved to protect the pensions of 8 million working people and to stabilize the pensions of 32 million more. Congress should not now let companies endanger those workers' pension funds.\nI know the proposal to liberalize the ability of employers to take money out of pension funds for other purposes would raise money for the Treasury. But I believe it is false economy. I vetoed that proposal last year, and I would have to do so again.\nFinally, if our working families are going to succeed in the new economy, they must be able to buy health insurance policies that they do not lose when they change jobs or when someone in their family gets sick. Over the past 2 years, over one million Americans in working families have lost their health insurance. We have to do more to make health care available to every American. And Congress should start by passing the bipartisan bill sponsored by Senator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum that would require insurance companies to stop dropping people when they switch jobs and stop denying coverage for preexisting conditions. Let's all do that.\nAnd even as we enact savings in these programs, we must have a common commitment to preserve the basic protections of Medicare and Medicaid, not just to the poor but to people in working families, including children, people with disabilities, people with AIDS, senior citizens in nursing homes.\nIn the past 3 years, we've saved $15 billion just by fighting health care fraud and abuse. We have all agreed to save much more. We have all agreed to stabilize the Medicare Trust Fund. But we must not abandon our fundamental obligations to the people who need Medicare and Medicaid. America cannot become stronger if they become weaker.\nThe \"GI bill\" for workers, tax relief for education and child rearing, pension availability and protection, access to health care, preservation of Medicare and Medicaid, these things, along with the Family and Medical Leave Act passed in 1993, these things will help responsible, hard-working American families to make the most of their own lives.\nBut employers and employees must do their part, as well, as they are doing in so many of our finest companies, working together, putting the long-term prosperity ahead of the short-term gain. As workers increase their hours and their productivity, employers should make sure they get the skills they need and share the benefits of the good years, as well as the burdens of the bad ones. When companies and workers work as a team they do better, and so does America.\nOur fourth great challenge is to take our streets back from crime and gangs and drugs. At last we have begun to find a way to reduce crime, forming community partnerships with local police forces to catch criminals and prevent crime. This strategy, called community policing, is clearly working. Violent crime is coming down all across America. In New York City murders are down 25 percent, in St. Louis, 18 percent, in Seattle, 32 percent. But we still have a long way to go before our streets are safe and our people are free from fear.\nThe crime bill of 1994 is critical to the success of community policing. It provides funds for 100,000 new police in communities of all sizes. We're already a third of the way there. And I challenge the Congress to finish the job. Let us stick with a strategy that's working and keep the crime rate coming down.\nCommunity policing also requires bonds of trust between citizens and police. I ask all Americans to respect and support our law enforcement officers. And to our police, I say, our children need you as role models and heroes. Don't let them down.\nThe Brady bill has already stopped 44,000 people with criminal records from buying guns. The assault weapons ban is keeping 19 kinds of assault weapons out of the hands of violent gangs. I challenge the Congress to keep those laws on the books.\nOur next step in the fight against crime is to take on gangs the way we once took on the mob. I'm directing the FBI and other investigative agencies to target gangs that involve juveniles and violent crime, and to seek authority to prosecute as adults teenagers who maim and kill like adults.\nAnd I challenge local housing authorities and tenant associations: Criminal gang members and drug dealers are destroying the lives of decent tenants. From now on, the rule for residents who commit crime and pedal drugs should be one strike and you're out.\nI challenge every State to match Federal policy to assure that serious violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentence.\nMore police and punishment are important, but they're not enough. We have got to keep more of our young people out of trouble, with prevention strategies not dictated by Washington but developed in communities. I challenge all of our communities, all of our adults, to give our children futures to say yes to. And I challenge Congress not to abandon the crime bill's support of these grassroots prevention efforts.\nFinally, to reduce crime and violence we have to reduce the drug problem. The challenge begins in our homes, with parents talking to their children openly and firmly. It embraces our churches and synagogues, our youth groups and our schools.\nI challenge Congress not to cut our support for drug-free schools. People like the D.A.R.E. officers are making a real impression on grade schoolchildren that will give them the strength to say no when the time comes.\nMeanwhile, we continue our efforts to cut the flow of drugs into America. For the last 2 years, one man in particular has been on the front lines of that effort. Tonight I am nominating him, a hero of the Persian Gulf War and the Commander in Chief of the United States Military Southern Command, General Barry McCaffrey, as America's new drug czar.\nGeneral McCaffrey has earned three Purple Hearts and two Silver Stars fighting for this country. Tonight I ask that he lead our Nation's battle against drugs at home and abroad. To succeed, he needs a force far larger than he has ever commanded before. He needs all of us. Every one of us has a role to play on this team.\nThank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your country one more time.\nOur fifth challenge: to leave our environment safe and clean for the next generation. Because of a generation of bipartisan effort we do have cleaner water and air, lead levels in children's blood has been cut by 70 percent, toxic emissions from factories cut in half. Lake Erie was dead, and now it's a thriving resource. But 10 million children under 12 still live within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump. A third of us breathe air that endangers our health. And in too many communities the water is not safe to drink. We still have much to do.\nYet Congress has voted to cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent. That means more toxic chemicals in our water, more smog in our air, more pesticides in our food. Lobbyists for polluters have been allowed to write their own loopholes into bills to weaken laws that protect the health and safety of our children. Some say that the taxpayer should pick up the tab for toxic waste and let polluters who can afford to fix it off the hook. I challenge Congress to reexamine those policies and to reverse them.\nThis issue has not been a partisan issue. The most significant environmental gains in the last 30 years were made under a Democratic Congress and President Richard Nixon. We can work together. We have to believe some basic things. Do you believe we can expand the economy without hurting the environment? I do. Do you believe we can create more jobs over the long run by cleaning the environment up? I know we can. That should be our commitment.\nWe must challenge businesses and communities to take more initiative in protecting the environment, and we have to make it easier for them to do it. To businesses this administration is saying: If you can find a cheaper, more efficient way than Government regulations require to meet tough pollution standards, do it, as long as you do it right. To communities we say: We must strengthen community right-to-know laws requiring polluters to disclose their emissions, but you have to use the information to work with business to cut pollution. People do have a right to know that their air and their water are safe.\nOur sixth challenge is to maintain America's leadership in the fight for freedom and peace throughout the world. Because of American leadership, more people than ever before live free and at peace. And Americans have known 50 years of prosperity and security.\nWe owe thanks especially to our veterans of World War II. I would like to say to Senator Bob Dole and to all others in this Chamber who fought in World War II, and to all others on both sides of the aisle who have fought bravely in all our conflicts since: I salute your service and so do the American people.\nAll over the world, even after the cold war, people still look to us and trust us to help them seek the blessings of peace and freedom. But as the cold war fades into memory, voices of isolation say America should retreat from its responsibilities. I say they are wrong.\nThe threats we face today as Americans respect no Nation's borders. Think of them: terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, drug trafficking, ethnic and religious hatred, aggression by rogue states, environmental degradation. If we fail to address these threats today, we will suffer the consequences in all our tomorrows.\nOf course, we can't be everywhere. Of course, we can't do everything. But where our interests and our values are at stake, and where we can make a difference, America must lead. We must not be isolationist. We must not be the world's policeman. But we can and should be the world's very best peacemaker.\nBy keeping our military strong, by using diplomacy where we can and force where we must, by working with others to share the risk and the cost of our efforts, America is making a difference for people here and around the world. For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age—for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age—there is not a single Russian missile pointed at America's children.\nNorth Korea has now frozen its dangerous nuclear weapons program. In Haiti, the dictators are gone, democracy has a new day, the flow of desperate refugees to our shores has subsided. Through tougher trade deals for America, over 80 of them, we have opened markets abroad, and now exports are at an all-time high, growing faster than imports and creating good American jobs.\nWe stood with those taking risks for peace: in Northern Ireland, where Catholic and Protestant children now tell their parents, violence must never return; in the Middle East, where Arabs and Jews who once seemed destined to fight forever now share knowledge and resources and even dreams.\nAnd we stood up for peace in Bosnia. Remember the skeletal prisoners, the mass graves, the campaign to rape and torture, the endless lines of refugees, the threat of a spreading war. All these threats, all these horrors have now begun to give way to the promise of peace. Now our troops and a strong NATO, together with our new partners from central Europe and elsewhere, are helping that peace to take hold.\nAs all of you know, I was just there with a bipartisan congressional group, and I was so proud not only of what our troops were doing but of the pride they evidenced in what they were doing. They knew what America's mission in this world is, and they were proud to be carrying it out.\nThrough these efforts, we have enhanced the security of the American people, but make no mistake about it: Important challenges remain.\nThe START II treaty with Russia will cut our nuclear stockpiles by another 25 percent. I urge the Senate to ratify it now. We must end the race to create new nuclear weapons by signing a truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty this year.\nAs we remember what happened in the Japanese subway, we can outlaw poison gas forever if the Senate ratifies the Chemical Weapons Convention this year. We can intensify the fight against terrorists and organized criminals at home and abroad if Congress passes the antiterrorism legislation I proposed after the Oklahoma City bombing, now. We can help more people move from hatred to hope all across the world in our own interest if Congress gives us the means to remain the world's leader for peace.\nMy fellow Americans, the six challenges I have just discussed are for all of us. Our seventh challenge is really America's challenge to those of us in this hallowed Hall tonight: to reinvent our Government and make our democracy work for them.\nLast year this Congress applied to itself the laws it applies to everyone else. This Congress banned gifts and meals from lobbyists. This Congress forced lobbyists to disclose who pays them and what legislation they are trying to pass or kill. This Congress did that, and I applaud you for it.\nNow I challenge Congress to go further, to curb special interest influence in politics by passing the first truly bipartisan campaign finance reform bill in a generation. You, Republicans and Democrats alike, can show the American people that we can limit spending and we can open the airwaves to all candidates.\nI also appeal to Congress to pass the line-item veto you promised the American people.\nOur administration is working hard to give the American people a Government that works better and costs less. Thanks to the work of Vice President Gore, we are eliminating 16,000 pages of unnecessary rules and regulations, shifting more decisionmaking out of Washington, back to States and local communities.\nAs we move into the era of balanced budgets and smaller Government, we must work in new ways to enable people to make the most of their own lives. We are helping America's communities, not with more bureaucracy but with more opportunities. Through our successful empowerment zones and community development banks, we're helping people to find jobs, to start businesses. And with tax incentives for companies that clean up abandoned industrial property, we can bring jobs back to places that desperately, desperately need them.\nBut there are some areas that the Federal Government should not leave and should address and address strongly. One of these areas is the problem of illegal immigration. After years of neglect, this administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders. We are increasing border controls by 50 percent. We are increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants. And tonight, I announce I will sign an Executive order to deny Federal contracts to businesses that hire illegal immigrants.\nLet me be very clear about this: We are still a nation of immigrants; we should be proud of it. We should honor every legal immigrant here, working hard to be a good citizen, working hard to become a new citizen. But we are also a nation of laws.\nI want to say a special word now to those who work for our Federal Government. Today the Federal work force is 200,000 employees smaller than it was the day I took office as President. Our Federal Government today is the smallest it has been in 30 years, and it's getting smaller every day. Most of our fellow Americans probably don't know that. And there's a good reason—a good reason: The remaining Federal work force is composed of hard-working Americans who are now working harder and working smarter than ever before to make sure the quality of our services does not decline.\nI'd like to give you one example. His name is Richard Dean. He's a 49-year-old Vietnam veteran who's worked for the Social Security Administration for 22 years now. Last year he was hard at work in the Federal Building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 169 people and brought the rubble down all around him. He reentered that building four times. He saved the lives of three women. He's here with us this evening, and I want to recognize Richard and applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal heroism. But Richard Dean's story doesn't end there. This last November, he was forced out of his office when the Government shut down. And the second time the Government shut down he continued helping Social Security recipients, but he was working without pay.\nOn behalf of Richard Dean and his family, and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the American people, I challenge all of you in this Chamber: Let's never, ever shut the Federal Government down again.\nOn behalf of all Americans, especially those who need their Social Security payments at the beginning of March, I also challenge the Congress to preserve the full faith and credit of the United States, to honor the obligations of this great Nation as we have for 220 years, to rise above partisanship and pass a straightforward extension of the debt limit and show people America keeps its word.\nI know that this evening I have asked a lot of Congress and even more from America. But I am confident: When Americans work together in their homes, their schools, their churches, their synagogues, their civic groups, their workplace, they can meet any challenge.\nI say again, the era of big Government is over. But we can't go back to the era of fending for yourself. We have to go forward to the era of working together as a community, as a team, as one America, with all of us reaching across these lines that divide us— the division, the discrimination, the rancor—we have to reach across it to find common ground. We have got to work together if we want America to work.\nI want you to meet two more people tonight who do just that. Lucius Wright is a teacher in the Jackson, Mississippi, public school system. A Vietnam veteran, he has created groups to help inner-city children turn away from gangs and build futures they can believe in. Sergeant Jennifer Rodgers is a police officer in Oklahoma City. Like Richard Dean, she helped to pull her fellow citizens out of the rubble and deal with that awful tragedy. She reminds us that in their response to that atrocity the people of Oklahoma City lifted all of us with their basic sense of decency and community.\nLucius Wright and Jennifer Rodgers are special Americans. And I have the honor to announce tonight that they are the very first of several thousand Americans who will be chosen to carry the Olympic torch on its long journey from Los Angeles to the centennial of the modern Olympics in Atlanta this summer, not because they are star athletes but because they are star citizens, community heroes meeting America's challenges. They are our real champions.\nPlease stand up.\nNow each of us must hold high the torch of citizenship in our own lives. None of us can finish the race alone. We can only achieve our destiny together, one hand, one generation, one American connecting to another.\nThere have always been things we could do together, dreams we could make real which we could never have done on our own. We Americans have forged our identity, our very Union, from the very point of view that we can accommodate every point on the planet, every different opinion. But we must be bound together by a faith more powerful than any doctrine that divides us, by our belief in progress, our love of liberty, and our relentless search for common ground.\nAmerica has always sought and always risen to every challenge. Who would say that having come so far together, we will not go forward from here? Who would say that this age of possibility is not for all Americans?\nOur country is and always has been a great and good nation. But the best is yet to come if we all do our parts.\nThank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\n","Lol may go out leh.","Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each who take turns batting and fielding. The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball (that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung by the batter, and then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and touches home plate. Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning. Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is currently popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League. The World Baseball Classic, organized by WBSB, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world.\nThe evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la soule, with similarities to baseball. Other old French games such as thèque, la balle au bâton, and la balle empoisonnée also appear to be related. Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game, by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and \"tut-ball\". It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders. The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description of \"base-ball\" and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases. David Block discovered that the first recorded game of \"Bass-Ball\" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player. William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey. This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the United States by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town's new meeting house. Block, pp. 58, 160, 300, 307, 310; By 1796, a version of the game was well-known enough to earn a mention in a German scholar's book on popular pastimes. As described by Johann Gutsmuths, \"englische Base-ball\" involved a contest between two teams, in which \"the batter has three attempts to hit the ball while at the home plate. \" Only one out was required to retire a side. By the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America. These games were often referred to locally as \"town ball\", though other names such as \"round-ball\" and \"base-ball\" were also used. Among the earliest examples to receive a detailed description—albeit five decades after the fact, in a letter from an attendee to Sporting Life magazine—took place in Beachville, Ontario, in 1838. There were many similarities to modern baseball, and some crucial differences: five bases (or byes); first bye just 18 ft from the home bye; batter out if a hit ball was caught after the first bounce. The once widely accepted story that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown, New York, in 1839 has been conclusively debunked by sports historians. In 1845, Alexander Cartwright, a member of New York City's Knickerbocker Club, led the codification of the so-called Knickerbocker Rules. The practice, common to bat-and-ball games of the day, of \"soaking\" or \"plugging\"—effecting a putout by hitting a runner with a thrown ball—was barred. The rules thus facilitated the use of a smaller, harder ball than had been common. Several other rules also brought the Knickerbockers' game close to the modern one, though a ball caught on the first bounce was, again, an out and only underhand pitching was allowed. While there are reports that the New York Knickerbockers played games in 1845, the contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846, in Hoboken, New Jersey: the \"New York Nine\" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings. With the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century.\nIn the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area. By 1856, local journals were referring to baseball as the \"national pastime\" or \"national game. \" A year later, sixteen area clubs formed the sport's first governing body, the National Association of Base Ball Players. In 1858 in Corona, Queens, New York, at the Fashion Race Course, the first games of baseball to charge admission took place. The games, which took place between the all-stars of Brooklyn, including players from the Brooklyn Atlantics, Excelsior of Brooklyn, Putnams and Eckford of Brooklyn, and the All-Stars of New York (Manhattan), including players from the New York Knickerbockers, Gothams (predecessors of the San Francisco Giants), Eagles and Empire, are commonly believed to be the first all-star baseball games. In 1863, the organization disallowed putouts made by catching a fair ball on the first bounce. Four years later, it barred participation by African Americans. The game's commercial potential was developing: in 1869 the first fully professional baseball club, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was formed and went undefeated against a schedule of semipro and amateur teams. The first professional league, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, lasted from 1871 to 1875; scholars dispute its status as a major league. The more formally structured National League was founded in 1876. As the oldest surviving major league, the National League is sometimes referred to as the \"senior circuit. \" Several other major leagues formed and failed. In 1884, African American Moses Walker (and, briefly, his brother Welday) played in one of these, the American Association. An injury ended Walker's major league career, and by the early 1890s, a gentlemen's agreement in the form of the baseball color line effectively barred black players from the white-owned professional leagues, major and minor. Professional Negro leagues formed, but quickly folded. Several independent African American teams succeeded as barnstormers. Also in 1884, overhand pitching was legalized. In 1887, softball, under the name of indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent game. Virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in place by 1893; the last major change—counting foul balls as strikes—was instituted in 1901. The National League's first successful counterpart, the American League, which evolved from the minor Western League, was established that year. The two leagues, each with eight teams, were rivals that fought for the best players, often disregarding each other's contracts and engaging in bitter legal disputes. A modicum of peace was eventually established, leading to the National Agreement of 1903. The pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues. The World Series, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall, albeit without express major league sanction: The Boston Americans of the American League defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. The next year, the series was not held, as the National League champion New York Giants, under manager John McGraw, refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its champion. In 1905, the Giants were National League champions again and team management relented, leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major leagues' annual championship event. As professional baseball became increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against owners over issues of control and equitable income distribution. During the major leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted strikes, which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened. In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the reserve clause, which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended, tended to keep the players in check. Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner Charles Comiskey and gamblers' payoffs, real and promised, members of the Chicago White Sox conspired to throw the 1919 World Series. The Black Sox Scandal led to the formation of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together. The first major league baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League. Professional baseball was played in northeastern cities with a large immigrant-ethnic population; they gave strong support to the new sport. The Irish Catholics dominated in the late 19th century, comprising a third or more of the players and many of the top stars and managers. Historian Jerrold Casway argues that:\nCompared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers, including stars Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson, were more dominant. The \"inside game\", which demanded that players \"scratch for runs\", was played much more aggressively than it is today: the brilliant and often violent Ty Cobb epitomized this style. The so-called dead-ball era ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. Strict new regulations governing the ball's size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially banning the spitball and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances, followed the death of Ray Chapman after a pitch struck him in the head in August 1920. Coupled with superior materials available after World War I, this resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit. The construction of additional seating to accommodate the rising popularity of the game often had the effect of reducing the distance to the outfield fences, making home runs more common. The rise of the legendary player Babe Ruth, the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game. The club with which Ruth set most of his slugging records, the New York Yankees, built a reputation as the majors' premier team. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey invested in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern \"farm system\". A new Negro National League was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the Negro American League. The first elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame took place in 1936. In 1939 Little League Baseball was founded in Pennsylvania. By the late 1940s, it was the organizing body for children's baseball leagues across the United States. With America's entry into World War II, many professional players had left to serve in the armed forces. A large number of minor league teams disbanded as a result and the major league game seemed under threat as well. Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley led the formation of a new professional league with women players to help keep the game in the public eye – the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League existed from 1943 to 1954. The inaugural College World Series was held in 1947, and the Babe Ruth League youth program was founded. This program soon became another important organizing body for children's baseball. The first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred the previous year: Jackie Robinson was signed by the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers—where Branch Rickey had become general manager—and began playing for their minor league team in Montreal. In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues' color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers; Larry Doby debuted with the American League's Cleveland Indians later the same year. Latin American players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born Chico Carrasquel and black Cuban-born Minnie Miñoso, became the first Hispanic All-Stars. Facing competition as varied as television and football, baseball attendance at all levels declined. While the majors rebounded by the mid-1950s, the minor leagues were gutted and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams dissolved. Integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster. That year, the Major League Baseball Players Association was founded. It was the first professional baseball union to survive more than briefly, but it remained largely ineffective for years. No major league team had been located west of St. Louis until 1958, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. The majors' final all-white bastion, the Boston Red Sox, added a black player in 1959. With the integration of the majors drying up the available pool of players, the last Negro league folded the following year. In 1961, the American League reached the West Coast with the Los Angeles Angels expansion team, and the major league season was extended from 154 games to 162. This coincidentally helped Roger Maris break Babe Ruth's long-standing single-season home run record, one of the most celebrated marks in baseball. Along with the Angels, three other new franchises were launched during 1961–62. With this, the first major league expansion in 60 years, each league now had ten teams.\nThe players' union became bolder under the leadership of former United Steelworkers chief economist and negotiator Marvin Miller, who was elected executive director in 1966. On the playing field, major league pitchers were becoming increasingly dominant again. After the 1968 season, in an effort to restore balance, the strike zone was reduced and the height of the pitcher's mound was lowered from 15 to 10 inches (38.1 - 25.4 cm). In 1969, both the National and American Leagues added two more expansion teams, the leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, and a post-season playoff system leading to the World Series was instituted. Also that same year, Curt Flood of the St. Louis Cardinals made the first serious legal challenge to the reserve clause. The major leagues' first general players' strike took place in 1972, delaying the season's start for two weeks. In another effort to add more offense to the game, the American League adopted the designated hitter rule the following year. In 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was effectively struck down, leading to the free agency system. In 1977, two more expansion teams joined the American League. Significant work stoppages occurred again in 1981 and 1994, the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years. Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance. The addition of two more expansion teams after the 1993 season had facilitated another restructuring of the major leagues, this time into three divisions each. Offensive production—the number of home runs in particular—had surged that year, and again in the abbreviated 1994 season. After play resumed in 1995, this trend continued and non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set. The next year, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa both surpassed Maris's decades-old single-season home run record, and two more expansion franchises were added. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of Major League Baseball . In 2001, Barry Bonds established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by the abuse of illegal steroids (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004. In 2007, Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, surpassing Hank Aaron, as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs. Even though McGwire, Sosa, and Bonds—as well as many other players, including storied pitcher Roger Clemens—have been implicated in the steroid abuse scandal, their feats and those of other sluggers had become the major leagues' defining attraction. In contrast to the professional game's resurgence in popularity after the 1994 interruption, Little League enrollment was in decline: after peaking in 1996, it dropped 1 percent a year over the following decade. With more rigorous testing and penalties for performance-enhancing drug use a possible factor, the balance between bat and ball swung markedly in 2010, which became known as the \"Year of the Pitcher\". Runs per game fell to their lowest level in 18 years, and the strikeout rate was higher than it had been in half a century. Before the start of the 2012 season, MLB altered its rules to double the number of wild card teams admitted into the playoffs to two per league. The playoff expansion resulted in the addition of annual one-game playoffs between the wild card teams in each league.\nBaseball, widely known as America's pastime, is well established in several other countries as well. The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked with that of the sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both countries. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League. The Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, the first and still the only club from outside the United States to do so. After the 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated the Expos to Washington, D.C., where the team is now known as the Nationals. In 1847, American soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in Mexico at Parque Los Berros in Xalapa, Veracruz. A few days after the Battle of Cerro Gordo, they used the \"wooden leg captured (by the Fourth Illinois regiment) from General Santa Anna\". The first formal baseball league outside of the United States and Canada was founded in 1878 in Cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition and whose national team has been one of the world's strongest since international play began in the late 1930s (all organized baseball in the country has officially been amateur since the Cuban Revolution). The Dominican Republic held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912. Professional baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between the world wars, including the Netherlands (formed in 1922), Australia, Japan (1936), Mexico (1937), and Puerto Rico (1938). The Japanese major leagues—the Central League and Pacific League—have long been considered the highest quality professional circuits outside of the United States. Japan has a professional minor league system as well, though it is much smaller than the American version—each team has only one farm club in contrast to MLB teams' four or five. After World War II, professional leagues were founded in many Latin American countries, most prominently Venezuela and the Dominican Republic (1955). Since the early 1970s, the annual Caribbean Series has matched the championship clubs from the four leading Latin American winter leagues: the Dominican Professional Baseball League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. In Asia, South Korea, Taiwan (1990) and China (2003) all have professional leagues. Many European countries have professional leagues as well, the most successful, other than the Dutch league, being the Italian league founded in 1948. Compared to those in Asia and Latin America, the various European leagues and the one in Australia historically have had no more than niche appeal. In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the Olympic Games. The Israel Baseball League, launched in 2007, folded after one season. The Confédération Européene de Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries, as well as national squads. Other competitions between national teams, such as the Baseball World Cup and the Olympic baseball tournament, were administered by the International Baseball Federation from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the International Softball Federation to create the current joint governing body for both sports, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC). By 2009, the IBAF had 117 member countries. Women's baseball is played on an organized amateur basis in many of the countries where it is a leading men's sport. Since 2004, the IBAF and now WBSC have sanctioned the Women's Baseball World Cup, featuring national teams. After being admitted to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games, baseball was dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained part of the 2008 Games. The elimination of baseball, along with softball, from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC to consider adding two different sports, but none received the votes required for inclusion. While the sport's lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was Major League Baseball's reluctance to have a break during the Games to allow its players to participate, as the National Hockey League now does during the Winter Olympic Games. Such a break is more difficult for MLB to accommodate because it would force the playoffs deeper into cold weather. Seeking reinstatement for the 2016 Summer Olympics, the IBAF proposed an abbreviated competition designed to facilitate the participation of top players, but the effort failed. Major League Baseball initiated the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede the major league season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.\nA game is played between two teams, each composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an inning. A game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in doubleheaders in college and minor leagues). One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by circling or completing a tour of the four bases set at the corners of the square-shaped baseball diamond. A player bats at home plate and must proceed counterclockwise to first base, second base, third base, and back home in order to score a run. The team in the field attempts both to prevent runs from scoring and to record outs, which remove opposing players from offensive action until their turn in their team's batting order comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings. Thurston, p. 15; The game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height (many amateur games are played on unfenced fields). The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well. There are three basic tools of baseball: the ball, the bat, and the glove or mitt: Protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters. At the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another player, the catcher, squats on the far side of home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well, though the number will vary depending on the level of play; amateur or children's games may only have an umpire behind the plate, while as many as six umpires can be used for important major league games. Play starts with a batter standing at home plate, holding a bat.<ref name=RulesPuttingBallInPlay> The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts to hit the ball with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out (see below) is said to be safe and is now on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error. Any runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, before or after the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base. A pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are recorded strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee. A strike is called when one of the following happens: A ball is called when the pitcher throws a pitch that is outside the strike zone, provided the batter has not swung at it. While the team at bat is trying to score runs, the team in the field is attempting to record outs. Among the various ways a member of the batting team may be put out, five are most common: It is possible to record two outs in the course of the same play. This is called a double play. Even three outs in one play, a triple play, is possible, though this is very rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty of runners. An individual player's turn batting or plate appearance is complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball that results in the team's third out, even if it is recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules. Thurston, p. 100; If the designated hitter rule is in effect, each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run). The DH takes the place of another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.\nRoster, or squad, sizes differ between different leagues and different levels of organized play. Major League Baseball teams maintain 25-player active rosters. A typical 25-man roster in a league without the DH rule, such as MLB's National League, features: In the American League and others with the DH rule, there will usually be nine offensive regulars (including the DH), five starting pitchers, seven or eight relievers, a backup catcher and two or three other reserves; the need for late-inning pinch-hitters is reduced by the DH.\nThe manager, or head coach of a team, oversees the team's major strategic decisions, such as establishing the starting rotation, setting the lineup, or batting order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in particular, bringing in relief pitchers. Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning. At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, occupying designated coaches' boxes just outside the foul lines, assist in the direction of baserunners when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners during pauses in play. In contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform in order to be allowed on the field to confer with players during a game. Any baseball game involves one or more umpires, who make rulings on the outcome of each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.\nMany of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters tend to be more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting one or more of the right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder. Furthermore, unlike players in most team sports, baseball players can not return to a game after being replaced; this creates a greater risk when making lineup changes, especially as a team's pitching staff may be increasingly depleted in the late innings of a game, particularly one which goes into multiple extra innings.\nThe tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, as well as its general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.\nSeveral basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even at the expense of the batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.\nBaseball has certain attributes that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none of them is the variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.\nIn clock-limited sports, games often end with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even in the case of multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting. While nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took an hour and a half to play. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960. By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters). In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45. By 2014, though, the average MLB game took over three hours to complete. The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently. Other leagues have experienced similar issues. In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18. In 2016, the average nine-inning playoff game in Major League baseball was 3 hours and 35 minutes. This up 10 minutes from 2015 and up 21 minutes from 2014.\nAlthough baseball is a team sport, individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure. In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: \"the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits\". Contrasting the game with both football and basketball, scholar Michael Mandelbaum argues that \"baseball is the one closest in evolutionary descent to the older individual sports\". Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it. As described by Mandelbaum, It is impossible to isolate and objectively assess the contribution each [football] team member makes to the outcome of the play... [E]very basketball player is interacting with all of his teammates all the time. In baseball, by contrast, every player is more or less on his own... Baseball is therefore a realm of complete transparency and total responsibility. A baseball player lives in a glass house, and in a stark moral universe... Everything that every player does is accounted for and everything accounted for is either good or bad, right or wrong. Cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play. Morton, Richard, \"Baseball in England\", Badminton Magazine, August 1896, pp. 157–158: \"The scoring is one of the most interesting features in this new importation from America [baseball]. Every detail of play is recorded, and a man's mistakes are tabulated as well as his successes... A line in a cricket score may read, 'Lockwood, caught Stoddart, bowled J. T. Hearne; 30.'... [T]here is so much that is left out! There is no mention of the fact that O'Brien missed Lockwood before he had scored, and that somebody else failed to take a chance when his score was ten. These are items that go to make cricket history; but there is no record of them in the analysis... The man who catches a ball is thought worthy of mention, but the man who muffs one does not suffer by publicity. \"\nUnlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams following the rules of Major League and Minor League Baseball is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of 325 ft from home plate to the fences in left and right field and 400 ft to center. Major league teams often skirt even this rule. For example, at Minute Maid Park, which became the home of the Houston Astros in 2000, the Crawford Boxes in left field are only 315 ft from home plate. There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's Fenway Park, in use since 1912: the Green Monster is 310 ft from home plate down the line and 37 ft tall. Similarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf. Surface variations can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant. These physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies. Its high altitude—5282 ft above sea level—is responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues. Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off Lake Michigan are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in. The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball 330 ft into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the New York Yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed pull hitters, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.\nOrganized baseball lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, was responsible for the \"development of the box score, tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the batting average, and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball. \" The statistical record is so central to the game's \"historical essence\" that Chadwick came to be known as Father Baseball. In the 1920s, American newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian Alan Schwarz describes as a \"tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines. \" The Official Baseball Rules administered by Major League Baseball require the official scorer to categorize each baseball play unambiguously. The rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency. The score report is the official basis for both the box score of the game and the relevant statistical records. General managers, managers, and baseball scouts use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic decisions. Certain traditional statistics are familiar to most baseball fans. The basic batting statistics include: The basic baserunning statistics include: The basic pitching statistics include: The basic fielding statistics include: Among the many other statistics that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics. For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, the manager of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.\nSabermetrics refers to the field of baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools. The term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves. The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, Bill James, and derives from the Society for American Baseball Research . The growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average: Some of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use:\nWriting in 1919, philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen described baseball as America's national religion. In the words of sports columnist Jayson Stark, baseball has long been \"a unique paragon of American culture\"—a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse scandal. Baseball has an important place in other national cultures as well: Scholar Peter Bjarkman describes \"how deeply the sport is ingrained in the history and culture of a nation such as Cuba, [and] how thoroughly it was radically reshaped and nativized in Japan. \" Since the early 1980s, the Dominican Republic, in particular the city of San Pedro de Macorís, has been the major leagues' primary source of foreign talent. Hall-of-Famer Roberto Clemente remains one of the greatest national heroes in Puerto Rico's history. While baseball has long been the island's primary athletic pastime, its once well-attended professional winter league has declined in popularity since 1990, when young Puerto Rican players began to be included in the major leagues' annual first-year player draft. In the Western Hemisphere, baseball is also one of the leading sports in Canada, Colombia, Mexico, the Netherlands Antilles, Nicaragua, Panama, and Venezuela. In Asia, it is among the most popular sports in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan Area. The major league game in the United States was originally targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience. A century later, the situation was very different. With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading American spectator sports. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, baseball's position compared to football in the United States moved in contradictory directions. In 2008, Major League Baseball set a revenue record of $6.5 billion, matching the NFL's revenue for the first time in decades. A new MLB revenue record of $6.6 billion was set in 2009.<ref name=Brown10> On the other hand, the percentage of American sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport was 16%, compared to pro football at 31%. In 1985, the respective figures were pro football 24%, baseball 23%. Because there are so many more major league games played, there is no comparison in overall attendance. In 2008, total attendance at major league games was the second-highest in history: 78.6 million, 0.7% off the record set the previous year. The following year, amid the U.S. recession, attendance fell by 6.6% to 73.4 million. Attendance at games held under the Minor League Baseball umbrella also set a record in 2007, with 42.8 million; this figure does not include attendance at games of the several independent minor leagues. In Japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in Nippon Professional Baseball, the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific Leagues, was estimated at $1 billion in 2007. Total NPB attendance for the year was approximately 20 million. While in the preceding two decades, MLB attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled, the comparable NPB figures were stagnant. There are concerns that MLB's growing interest in acquiring star Japanese players will hurt the game in their home country. In Cuba, where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport, the national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the top-level domestic leagues. Revenue figures are not released for the country's amateur system. Similarly, according to one official pronouncement, the sport's governing authority \"has never taken into account attendance ... because its greatest interest has always been the development of athletes\". As of 2007, Little League Baseball oversees more than 7,000 children's baseball leagues with more than 2.2 million participants–2.1 million in the United States and 123,000 in other countries. Babe Ruth League teams have over 1 million participants. According to the president of the International Baseball Federation, between 300,000 and 500,000 women and girls play baseball around the world, including Little League and the introductory game of Tee Ball. A varsity baseball team is an established part of physical education departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2008, nearly half a million high schoolers and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' baseball teams. The number of Americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 1980s, falling well behind the number of soccer participants. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.\nBaseball has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the United States and elsewhere. Dozens of English-language idioms have been derived from baseball; in particular, the game is the source of a number of widely used sexual euphemisms. The first networked radio broadcasts in North America were of the 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play-by-play from New York City's Polo Grounds on WJZ–Newark, New Jersey, which was connected by wire to WGY–Schenectady, New York, and WBZ–Springfield, Massachusetts. The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom. Baseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment. One of the first major examples, Ernest Thayer's poem \"Casey at the Bat\", appeared in 1888. A wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a \"clutch situation\", the poem became the source of vaudeville and other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media. There have been many baseball movies, including the Academy Award–winning The Pride of the Yankees and the Oscar nominees The Natural (1984) and Field of Dreams (1989). The American Film Institute's selection of the ten best sports movies includes The Pride of the Yankees at number 3 and Bull Durham at number 5. Baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stage—the Adler–Ross musical Damn Yankees—and record—George J. Gaskin's \"Slide, Kelly, Slide\", Simon and Garfunkel's \"Mrs. Robinson\", and John Fogerty's \"Centerfield\". The baseball-inspired comedic sketch \"Who's on First\", popularized by Abbott and Costello in 1938, quickly became famous. Six decades later, Time named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century. Baseball is also featured in various video games including MLB: The Show, Wii Sports, Kinect Sports: Season 2 and Mario Baseball. Literary works connected to the game include the short fiction of Ring Lardner and novels such as Bernard Malamud's The Natural (the source for the movie), Robert Coover's The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop., and [[W. P. Kinsella]]'s Shoeless Joe (the source for Field of Dreams). Baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of Damon Runyon; the columns of Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Dick Young, and Peter Gammons; and the essays of Roger Angell. Among the celebrated nonfiction books in the field are Lawrence S. Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer, and Michael Lewis's Moneyball. The 1970 publication of major league pitcher Jim Bouton's tell-all chronicle Ball Four is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional sports. Baseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields. Modern fantasy sports began in 1980 with the invention of Rotisserie League Baseball by New York writer Daniel Okrent and several friends. Participants in a Rotisserie league draft notional teams from the list of active Major League Baseball players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players' latest real-world statistics. Rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon. Now known more generically as fantasy baseball, it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports. The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports–related websites. By 2008, 29.9 million people in the United States and Canada were playing fantasy sports, spending $800 million on the hobby. The burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetrics—first among fans, only later among baseball professionals.\n"]
