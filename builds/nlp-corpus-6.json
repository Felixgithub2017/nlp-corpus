["A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term molecule is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions. In the kinetic theory of gases, the term molecule is often used for any gaseous particle regardless of its composition. According to this definition, noble gas atoms are considered molecules as they are in fact monoatomic molecules. A molecule may be homonuclear, that is, it consists of atoms of one chemical element, as with oxygen ; or it may be heteronuclear, a chemical compound composed of more than one element, as with water (H 2 O). Atoms and complexes connected by non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds or ionic bonds, are generally not considered single molecules. Molecules as components of matter are common in organic substances (and therefore biochemistry). They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up the crust, mantle, and core of the Earth, contain many chemical bonds, but are not made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical molecule can be defined for ionic crystals (salts) and covalent crystals (network solids), although these are often composed of repeating unit cells that extend either in a plane (such as in graphene) or three-dimensionally (such as in diamond, quartz, or sodium chloride). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most condensed phases with metallic bonding, which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In glasses (solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals.\nThe science of molecules is called molecular chemistry or molecular physics, depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of chemical bonds, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system (bound state) composed of two or more atoms. Polyatomic ions may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term unstable molecule is used for very reactive species, i.e., short-lived assemblies (resonances) of electrons and nuclei, such as radicals, molecular ions, Rydberg molecules, transition states, van der Waals complexes, or systems of colliding atoms as in Bose–Einstein condensate.\nAccording to Merriam-Webster and the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word \"molecule\" derives from the Latin \"moles\" or small unit of mass. The definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest particles of pure chemical substances that still retain their composition and chemical properties. This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as rocks, salts, and metals, are composed of large crystalline networks of chemically bonded atoms or ions, but are not made of discrete molecules.\nMolecules are held together by either covalent bonding or ionic bonding. Several types of non-metal elements exist only as molecules in the environment. For example, hydrogen only exists as hydrogen molecule. A molecule of a compound is made out of two or more elements.\nA covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. These electron pairs are termed shared pairs or bonding pairs, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is termed covalent bonding.\nIonic bonding is a type of chemical bond that involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, and is the primary interaction occurring in ionic compounds. The ions are atoms that have lost one or more electrons (termed cations) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed anions). This transfer of electrons is termed electrovalence in contrast to covalence. In the simplest case, the cation is a metal atom and the anion is a nonmetal atom, but these ions can be of a more complicated nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH 4 + or SO 4 2− . Basically, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal for both atoms to obtain a full valence shell.\nMost molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye, but there are exceptions. DNA, a macromolecule, can reach macroscopic sizes, as can molecules of many polymers. Molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few angstroms to several dozen Å, or around one billionth of a meter. Single molecules cannot usually be observed by light (as noted above), but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an atomic force microscope. Some of the largest molecules are macromolecules or supermolecules. The smallest molecule is the diatomic hydrogen, with a bond length of 0.74 Å. Effective molecular radius is the size a molecule displays in solution. The table of permselectivity for different substances contains examples.\nThe chemical formula for a molecule uses one line of chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, and plus and minus (−) signs. These are limited to one typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts. A compound's empirical formula is a very simple type of chemical formula. It is the simplest integer ratio of the chemical elements that constitute it. For example, water is always composed of a 2:1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms, and ethyl alcohol or ethanol is always composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a 2:6:1 ratio. However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely – dimethyl ether has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same atoms in different arrangements are called isomers. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule. The molecular formula reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules. The empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule acetylene has molecular formula C 2 H 2, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH. The molecular mass can be calculated from the chemical formula and is expressed in conventional atomic mass units equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 ( 12 C isotope) atom. For network solids, the term formula unit is used in stoichiometric calculations.\nFor molecules with a complicated 3-dimensional structure, especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents, a simple molecular formula or even semi-structural chemical formula may not be enough to completely specify the molecule. In this case, a graphical type of formula called a structural formula may be needed. Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such chemical nomenclature requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.\nMolecules have fixed equilibrium geometries—bond lengths and angles— about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its reactivity. Isomers share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. Stereoisomers, a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different biochemical activities.\nMolecular spectroscopy deals with the response (spectrum) of molecules interacting with probing signals of known energy (or frequency, according to Planck's formula). Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule's energy exchange through absorbance or emission. Spectroscopy does not generally refer to diffraction studies where particles such as neutrons, electrons, or high energy X-rays interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal). Microwave spectroscopy commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. Infrared spectroscopy measures changes in vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or functional groups in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or near infrared light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy actually measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.\nThe study of molecules by molecular physics and theoretical chemistry is largely based on quantum mechanics and is essential for the understanding of the chemical bond. The simplest of molecules is the hydrogen molecule-ion, H 2 +, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the one-electron bond. H 2 + is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schrödinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of computational chemistry. When trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is sufficiently stable to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it \"must correspond to a depression on the potential energy surface that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state\". This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the helium dimer, He 2, which has one vibrational bound state and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures. Whether or not an arrangement of atoms is sufficiently stable to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition. Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an elementary particle); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.\n","\n... me and her sister had somethin goin on\n(Aiyyo, would you listen to me motherfucker?)\nI reach my peak, I can't speak\nCall my nigga Cheek, tell him that my will is weak\n(Aiyyo c'mon nigga, cut that)\nI'm sick of niggaz lyin, I'm sick of bitches hawkin\n(Aiyyo, yoyo Big, aiyyo chill)\nMatter of fact, I'm sick of talkin\n\nDamn... we was spose to rule the world baby\nWe was unstoppable!\nThe shit can't be over, no\nThe shit can't be over man\nI know you hear me nigga\nI know you hear me\nYou got too much livin to do\nToo much unfinished business\nIt ain't over\nLive your life\n\nI'm sittin in the crib dreamin about Leer jets and coupes\nThe way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop\nOops!\nI'm interrupted by a doorbell\n3:52, who the hell\nIs this?\nI gets up quick\nCocks my shit\nStop the dogs from barkin\nThen proceed to walkin\nIts a face that I seen before\nMy nigga Sing, we used to sling on the sixteenth floor\nCheck it\nI look deeper\nI see blood up on his sneakers\nAnd his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth\nSo I dip\nNigga, is you creepin or speakin?\nHe tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the beacon\nI opens up the door, pitiful\nIs he in critical?\nRetaliation for this one won't be minimal\nCuz I'm a criminal\nWay before the rap shit\nBust a gat shit\nPuff won't even know what happened\nIf it's done smoothly\nSilencers on the Uzi\nStashed in the hooptie\nMy alibi, any cutie\nWith a booty that done fucked big Pop\nHead spinnin, reminiscin bout my man C-Rock\n\nSomebody's gotta die\nIf I go, you got to go\nSomebody's gotta die\nLet the gunshots blow\nSomebody's gotta die\nNobody got to know\nThat I killed yo ass in the mix, bitch\n\nFillin clips he explained our situation\nPrecisely, so we know exactly what we facin\nSome kid named Jason In a Honda station wagon\nWas braggin\nAbout how much loot and crack he stackin\nRock had a grip so they formed up a clique\nSmall crew\nRound the time I was locked up with you\nTrue indeed\nBut yo nigga let me proceed\nDon't fill them clips too high\nGive them bullets room to breathe\nDamn where was I?\nYeah\nOne night in town\nBlew the fuck up\nD-Rock went home\nAnd Jay got stuck the fuck up\nHit em twice\nGot em right on the Persian white\nPistol whipped his kids\nAnd taped up his wife\nHe said \"Yo Rock, set em up\", no question\nWet em up no less\nThan 50 shots in his direction\nHow many shots?\nMan nigga, I seen mad holes\nWhat kinda gats?\nHitch links, Cops, and Calicoles\nBut fuck that\nI know where all them niggaz rest at\nIn the buildin hustlin\nAnd they don't be strapped\nSupreme in black\nIs downstairs, the engine runnin\nFind a bag to put the guns in\nAnd c'mon if yo comin\n\nExchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down\nHow its gonna go down\nLay these niggas low-down\nSlow down\nFuck all that plannin shit\nRun up in they cribs\nAnd make them cats abandon ship\nSee niggas like you do ten year bids\nMiss the niggas they want\nAnd murder innocent kids\nNot I\nOne niggas in my eye\nThat's Jason\nAin't no slugs gonna be wasted\nRevenge I'm tastin at the tip of my lips\nI can't wait to feel my clip in his hips\nPass the chocolate\nThai\nSing ain't lie\nThere's Jason with his back to me\nTalkin to his faculty\nI start to get a funny feelins\nPut the mask on in case his niggas start squealin\nScream his name out\nSqueeze six nothing shorter\nNigga turned around holdin his daughter\n\nUh, uh, uh, c'mon\n\nHah, sicka than your average Poppa\nTwist cabbage off instinct niggaz don't think shit stink\nPink gators, my Detroit players\nTimbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn\n\nDead right, if they head right, Biggie there every night\nPoppa been smooth since days of Underoos\nNever lose, never choose to bruise crews who\nDo something to us, talk go through us\n\nGirls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us\nWho us?

All the stories I had heard where about great experiences. Unfortunately for me, my first and only trip turned out to be the worst experience of my life.\n\nIt all started at my friends house, there was about 4 or 5 of us and I thought we was originally going to smoke some weed and just have a few beers but some guy my friend knew from the army pulled out some LSD. I can't remember what they where other than he said they where purple homs - double dipped, whatever that meant. I guess they dip the tab wait for it to dry then its dipped again.\n\nI didn't want to take it, but I thought I'd look like a whimp if I didn't, I guess today I'd rather of dealt with being called a whimp than have to deal with what I went through.\n\nI dropped it; about 30 minutes later I felt the initial sensation that I was reserved inside myself. I guess you could call it a feeling of defensiveness. My sensory perception was the first to go, along with feelings of paranoia. I was sitting in a chair facing all my other friends and I remember thinking the music was too loud, so I got up to turn the music down. My friends where looking at me a little weird. After I sat back down, I remember thinking, the music is too quiet, so I got back up and turned the music back up. Then again I thought now its too loud and got back up and turned it back down. This went on for quite a while, then I realized, oh no, is this was the trip has done to me?\n\nI was kind of stuck in a loop repeating my actions of getting up and down. Something was in my mind telling me stuff, I thought I have to ignore whatever my mind is telling me to beat this thing, whatever it was. I thought to myself, this trip is going to be some kind of test and I have to beat it.\n\nOf course after realizing that this was not going to be fun, I started to panic. But inwardly I thought, oh well I better try and handle it. I remember the feelings of paranoia, I could hear every little sensational noise, I noticed my friend had a copy of murder casebook on the floor, and I started to think about maybe they where after me or where conspiring against me. I could hear the neighbors kids screaming which all added to the paranoia of seeing a book on serial killers on my friends floor.\n\nI thought I have to get this out my system so I went to the bathroom and put my fingers down my throat all to none affect. I remember my friend coming up to me and asking me if the trip had kicked in yet and I said, 'yes'. I didn't really care at the time only that I had made a big mistake and there was nothing I could do about it. The sensations started to come and go about once every 10 minutes, I knew when it was going to happen and I tried to fight it. But eventually I couldn't control it.\n\nI thought my only chance is to go to sleep and sleep it off, I walked down my friends hallway into the bedroom at the end and I climbed into bed. I remember lying down and thinking I have to fall asleep. Of course I couldn't. So I got back up and started to walk back down the hallway towards the living room. When I got closer to the hallway, I kind of blinked and I ended up back outside the bedroom door. I thought what the heck, I just walked down there and how did I end up back here. I walked down the hallway again and I got to the living room and same thing, I blinked my eyes and I was back outside the bedroom door. I tried it again and again, and same thing every time I got closer to the living room I would blink and be back by the bedroom door.\n\nI remember a very distinct thought saying to me, 'This is hell, your are stuck in this hallway now for eternity'. The thought was the devil, I said to myself. I got very scared within myself. After a while this wore off, I got into the living room. I think I tried to tell my friend what just happened but they where all busy boasting about their little trips and their last thing that just happened to them. I sat down in the living room in the same chair and my friend said he was going out to take the dog for a walk. 2 other of my friends said they was going to go with him. So I said to them, 'Oh I'll go with you guys'. They responded very abruptly, 'No you won't you have to stay here'. I guess I must have been tripping more than them and they knew it. Of course within my own little trip world I started to get paranoid, why didn't they want me to go, they are conspiring to do something, maybe even kill me. So I thought to myself I have to get out of here quick and get home.\n\nOf course this was going to be a difficult task as I lived about 6 miles from my home. I ran down the hallway into my friend's bedroom and ran to the window. I opened the window as wide as it would go and jumped out the window. Luckily for me my friend lived on the ground floor of a bungalow style house. I remember just thinking to myself I have to get the heck out of here. I ran across this wooded area up towards a bridge where the main bus route went down. I climbed up the small embankment to the side of the bridge and onto the main road. I started to run up the road wanting to get home to my family and away from these people.\n\nI could feel my heart starting to beat faster and faster (I assume because I was running so fast). I started to hear voices telling me I was going to die and that this was my end. I started to hear an ambulance siren coming towards me. I remember stopping running and thinking, 'Oh know I'm going to have a heart attack and die'. I remember the fear very distinctly and the fear of death and not wanting to die like this. But then the ambulance went past where I was, it was a mere coincidence that at the time I was tripping and was running that an ambulance happened to race by, or was it even there at all I wondered. I realized it was a part of the trip after all. I continued to run up the road, I must have run a good mile to the next crossroads. For some reason I stopped heading for the direction of home and I crossed the street and stood behind this barred fence with railings. As I was standing there, I remember this semi-truck coming towards me, I thought oh God he's coming right for me, so I ran the opposite direction.\n\nI reached a work development where there were a lot of factories and I turned down into their development, I remember walking and seeing soccer ground with floodlights on the ground, so I climbed over the fence onto the grounds. I remember walking across the field looking up into the lights, thinking it was some spectacular mystery. I put my hands in my pocket and pulled out my money and threw it all in the air, then I took my watch of and threw it also, then my house keys. I then took my sweatshirt off and threw it in the air. I was now walking round with no money, no keys to get in my house and no top on.\n\nI remember falling into the grass. The grass was about 6 feet tall and that I was getting smaller and smaller. I could hear a stream of water starting to run around me and I then appeared to be in the water looking from a different perspective. I remember distinct thoughts saying to me that I was a molecule or some kind of cellular structure just floating around in a stream; I was some kind of stream creature.\n\nI don't remember much after this other than I must have blacked out. I came to about 3 to 4 hours later and thought where the heck am I. I started to have memories of seeing some old man with white hair at this mansion and I was talking to him. I wasn't tripping no more but I was having these memories of what had happened, I thought I was either dreaming or was having flashbacks. I remember a voice telling me I was the luckiest, greediest man in the world, I have no idea who was telling me this and why. I thought to myself at first that I must of died and that maybe this man had sent me back to earth because my time was not yet, and that this memory was from the place I had just came back from. My head was so messed up, I couldn't think right.\n\nI started to think how the heck am I going to get back to my friends house. I started to walk back out of the development and I saw 2 security guards driving past. They drove up to me; of course I was walking with no shirt on so they knew something was wrong. Right away they asked me if I was ok and had I been taking drugs. I told them I was ok and I knew where I was. They told me that they had seen me wondering around the development a few hours ago.\n\nThey drove me to their security hut and called the police. I remember hearing the police on the speakerphone. The security guy told the police that I had been taking drugs and was wondering around the development. The police asked the security guy if I was ok now and did I know where was, I told them yes, as I didn't want the police to come out, because if they took me home my mom would know I had taken drugs. So I told them, yes I knew where I was. The police said they wouldn't bother coming out then. After that I told the security guy that I lost my shirt and keys etc.\n\nI told him I threw it on the field, he just looked at me like I was crazy. I guess I was. Anyway he went and found my sweatshirt but couldn't find my money or keys. They let me go then. So I walked up the road thinking where the heck am I. I saw a taxi cab and flagged him down. I asked him did he know the name of my friend's road and he said yes, it was about a mile away. So I got in and he took me to my friends. By this time it was 6am in the morning. I had taken the LSD around 12 midnight. I think I actually blacked out for at least 4 hours. My friends afterwards told me they had been searching for me for about 4 hours around the streets.\n\nI tried to tell them what had happened but I couldn't remember much. My friend gave me a change of clothes and I went home like nothing had happened. To this day my family doesn't know what I did that night. I never took LSD ever again in fact any other drug or weed again.\n\nI few weeks later, I went to the same friends house and he was smoking weed, I went in and sat down. My friend asked me if I wanted a cup of tea. So I said yes. I started drinking the tea and all of a sudden I looked at the tea and a voice said to me, they have dropped LSD in your tea. I started to freak out and cuss at my friend saying, 'You have spiked my tea, what the heck'. He just looked at me like I was crazy. I said to my other friend, 'Lets get out of here', and I left. I never went back to his house again after that. This was my first inclination that I had some permanent damage due to the LSD a few weeks before.\n\nThis whole account of what happened that night could not compare to what really happened. The fear, the paranoia and the schizophrenic thoughts constantly bombarding my mind with harassment and propaganda. I would tell anyone even thinking of taking LSD to reconsider. I never thought this would affect me the way it has. I was no different to my friends in personality, but why it affected me different I don't know. My friends never did explain to me after what they experienced even to this day. All of us kind of drifted apart over the years.\n\nThis was not the end by no means. About 7 years ago, this was years after I had given up drinking and smoking weed etc. I was working out regular and was running a few times a week. I was running my daily routine of about a mile and a half of a fast run and I got to the end of my run and was approaching a hill, I remember feeling my heart beat real fast. All of a sudden, bam, I was having flashbacks of the time I was running in my trip and heard the ambulance. I was getting thoughts of I was going to die and have a heart attack.\n\nI stopped running and walked home the rest of the way. I went home and went upstairs and cried bitterly. I thought to myself this stuff has destroyed my mind. I started to panic and started to have a bad panic attack. I could hear thoughts of what I thought was the devil telling me I was going die and that he was going to get me and that I was going to hell. I was crying and didn't know what to do. I could feel this heaviness on my back like something was on me, a force, a bad spirit whatever you want to call it. After this I kneeled down by my bed and prayed to God to take it away.\n\nEventually after that experience I became a Christian and gave my life to God. I have suffered panic attacks since but on a milder scale also the thoughts constantly bombarding me sometimes don't stop, my mind is constantly racing around, I'm constantly thinking non stop about everything. I question everything and find it hard to trust people. I still get fear and dread sometimes out of nowhere. Also not long after this I was at college and went through a bad panic attack while walking through the college hallway. I started to think I was in some kind of hell corridor and that I was trapped in this corridor amongst all this evil. I walked out really quick. Also another time when I got on a bus I was walking down the bus to go sit on the back seat and all the faces on the bus where looking at me, I started going real paranoid and started to have flash backs. I thought the bus was in hell and all the people where demons and they where at any second going to jump up and grab me like a crazy zombie movie. I freaked out and got off the bus. I walked 2 ' miles to my friends because I couldn't get back on the bus.\n\nI have learnt to live with it over the years but in effect it died down a lot, I try and keep myself stress free as to not bring on any kind of flash back. LSD has affected me on a permanent level. I hope this convinces at least one person to not take LSD.\n\n","\nWhen me and my friend drove down to meet some friends at a local college, we were not expecting to do any tripping. We had done plenty of weed and X, but neither of us had ever had the connection or the interest to get acid. When we discovered our friends had some acid left over from the night before, (it was a pretty big priority for us to have the LSD tested by a reliable source) we pitched in some money and purchased 8 hits, which were dropped on gummi peaches. We weren't spending the night, and drove home to make the midnight curfew my mom had imposed on us.\n\nWhen we were about 30 minutes from home, we decided to go ahead and each take 2 of our 4 hits, even though we knew we would have to be talking to my mom. Then we hit traffic on the interstate, even though it was 11:00 PM, and I started to get a little uneasy. About 10 minutes from home, and 40 minutes after we first dropped the hits, we both started to giggle. Driving became extremely fun for my friend, who informed me that he would not be able to stop laughing when my mom answered the door.\n\n1 hour after dropping:\nWe stifled laughter as we pushed past my mom into the basement, where we would be spending the night. I quickly ran downstairs and turned on the TV, anxious for my mom to go to bed. I soon realized my friend wasn't behind me. Tracing my steps backwards, I found him sitting in the stairway staring at a mural of some birds.\n'Are you seeing this?' he asked me.\nLooking at the mural to see what he was talking about, I saw the trees begin to sway and the birds take flight. Knowing we were going to be in for a long night, I pulled him down to the couch where we waited for my mom to go to bed.\n\n2 hours after dropping:\nThe state of mind I found myself in was extremely interesting. My friend was repeatedly trying to get me to call another friend to act as 'ground control,' for he explained to me that he would periodically lose all concept of who he was or the situation he was in. I was comfortable with my surroundings, and as I described it to him 'in my element.' I found myself in the bathroom staring in the mirror, my friend was standing beside me but had changed into a completely different person. Staring at his face for a period of about a minute would find him changing into 4 different people, an elf, and a dog. (I find myself still, several months later, able to change his face with some concentration when I am really high)\n\nThe one thing that I cannot stress enough about LSD induced hallucinations is how real they seem. I have seen things with weed before, but never with the detail and clarity which I experienced on acid. The people I saw my friend change into I had never seen before, but each one of them held very distinct features and detail in the face, and when he spoke the words would be spoken by whatever person I was currently seeing. It was truly amazing to me. I then turned to the mirror, and immediately saw my face melt and distort itself into hideous images. Reading through several trip accounts before attempting LSD, I found it fascinating the relative ease and comfort which people viewed these terrifying images they described. Experiencing this first hand, I felt a strange sense of safety while seeing this, knowing that I was on acid and this was all part of the experience. Having said this, I can easily see how bad trips develop and cannot stress the importance of knowing what you are getting into and being in a comfortable environment. (ie. your basement)\n\nAs I continued to look into the mirror I became unable to distinguish which side of the mirror I was on, and felt as though I was inside looking out. As I placed my head against the mirror and stared into my own eyes, I would shift in and out of the correct side of the mirror, momentarily losing grip on reality.\n\n3.5 hours after dropping:\nThe decision to go outside was made out of sheer wonder and curiosity. Seeming to have the opposite effect of weed, the acid seemed to OVER calm our fears so that we were not neccesarily as careful as we probably should have been. Nevertheless, after a very interesting walk we ended up in the middle of my cul-de-sac. Light was everywhere. The whole cul-de-sac was illuminated in red, blue, and white light. We continually thought we saw headlights, but instead of running or hiding we stared awestruck. As my friend described how the cement had transformed itself into a Roman tiling, I witnessed a very different scene. The cul-de-sac had appeared to be the scene of an earthquake, the ground had wide cracks and the car parked in front of my house seemed to be sinking into the ground. Reality was not a concern of mine, and we did not contemplate at the time how strange we must of looked standing in the middle of the cul-de-sac staring at things. We remained outside for a couple of hours, as thoughts and emotions raced through our head only to be gone and forgotten a couple of seconds later.\n\nAfter we had our fill, we began to walk back to the basement. The walk back was probably the only part of the trip that bordered on frightening, because with each step the door seemed to get farther away and once we arrived the entrance to the basement seemed very ominous.\n\n6.5 hours after dropping:\nWe sat down and watched a little TV, and had a great time laughing at the visions we shared of people protruding from the television set. About 7.5 or 8 hours since we began, we could feel reality coming back to us. I first began to sense it in that I began to smell and taste the real world. It is difficult to describe, but just the taste of my mouth and the normal smells of my house were things that had become lost during the trip, and were now beginning to ground me. I went upstairs fearing the sleeplessness (I had to work the next morning), but found myself able to sleep within 30 minutes) The next day at work found me 'not quite there,' but everything did seem a little brighter.\n\nLSD did not provide the euphoria that MDMA does, so if you are looking to FEEL amazing it may not be for you. However, it does make for a great 8 hour adventure. \n\n","It's been a long time\nNow I'm coming back home\nI've been away now\nOh how I've been alone\nWait till I come back to your side\nWe'll forget the tears we've cried\n\nBut if your heart breaks\nDon't wait, turn me away\nAnd if your heart's strong\nHold on, I won't delay\nWait till I come back to your side\nWe'll forget the tears we've cried\n\nI feel as though you ought to know\nThat I've been good as good as I can be\nAnd if you do, I'll trust in you and know that you will wait for me\n\n","Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?\nWhy?\nJust wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.\nOh my God.

She's always been a Freudian nightmare.\nOkay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?\nBecause it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!\nWe're rehearsing a Greek play.\nThat's very funny. We done now?\nNo! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?\nThat would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.\nOkay, 'you' can't, or Still doing the play.

But I guess it was just the coma.\nCar's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends.

Couldn'ta gone worse.\nWell, howdya feel?\nPretty good! I told her.\nWell, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.\nOkay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.\nWhat's a 'niffle'?\nYou usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.\nAlright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...\nWait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!\nAlright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!\nNooo!\n","“_CON tal que las costumbres de un autor_,” says Don Thomas de las\nTorres, in the preface to his “Amatory Poems” _“sean puras y castas,\nimporto muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras”_--meaning,\nin plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure\npersonally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We\npresume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would\nbe a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him\nthere until his “Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely\nupon the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a\nmoral; and, what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered\nthat every fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a\ncommentary upon the “Batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s\nobject was to excite a distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going\na step farther, shows that the intention was to recommend to young\nmen temperance in eating and drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has\nsatisfied himself that, by Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin;\nby Antinous, Martin Luther; by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general;\nand, by the Harpies, the Dutch. Our more modern Scholiasts are\nequally acute. These fellows demonstrate a hidden meaning in “The\nAntediluvians,” a parable in Powhatan, “new views in Cock Robin,” and\ntranscendentalism in “Hop O’ My Thumb.” In short, it has been shown that\nno man can sit down to write without a very profound design. Thus to\nauthors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for example,\nneed have no care of his moral. It is there--that is to say, it is\nsomewhere--and the moral and the critics can take care of themselves.\nWhen the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended, and all\nthat he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “Dial,” or the\n“Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended, and\nthe rest that he clearly meant to intend:--so that it will all come very\nstraight in the end.\n\nThere is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by\ncertain ignoramuses--that I have never written a moral tale, or, in more\nprecise words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics predestined\nto bring me out, and develop my morals:--that is the secret. By and by\nthe “North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them ashamed of their\nstupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution--by way\nof mitigating the accusations against me--I offer the sad history\nappended,--a history about whose obvious moral there can be no question\nwhatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals which form\nthe title of the tale. I should have credit for this arrangement--a\nfar wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who reserve the\nimpression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus sneak it in at\nthe fag end of their fables.\n\nDefuncti injuria ne afficiantur was a law of the twelve tables, and De\nmortuis nil nisi bonum is an excellent injunction--even if the dead in\nquestion be nothing but dead small beer. It is not my design, therefore,\nto vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad dog, it is\ntrue, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was not to\nblame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his mother.\nShe did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant--for duties\nto her well--regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies, like\ntough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the better\nfor beating--but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be left-handed,\nand a child flogged left-handedly had better be left unflogged. The\nworld revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a baby from\nleft to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an evil\npropensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks\nits quota of wickedness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements,\nand, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was\ngetting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in\nmy eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when\nhe had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might\nhave mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced\nbeyond that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand\nit no longer, but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my\nvoice, made prophecy of his ruin.\n\nThe fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age\nhe used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At\nsix months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he\nwas in the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies.\nAt eight months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the\nTemperance pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after\nmonth, until, at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon\nwearing moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and\nswearing, and for backing his assertions by bets.\n\nThrough this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had\npredicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown\nwith his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when\nhe came to be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without\ninterlarding it with a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid\nwagers--no. I will do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon\nhave laid eggs. With him the thing was a mere formula--nothing more. His\nexpressions on this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They\nwere simple if not altogether innocent expletives--imaginative phrases\nwherewith to round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you so and\nso,” nobody ever thought of taking him up; but still I could not help\nthinking it my duty to put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and\nso I told him. It was a vulgar one--this I begged him to believe. It was\ndiscountenanced by society--here I said nothing but the truth. It was\nforbidden by act of Congress--here I had not the slightest intention\nof telling a lie. I remonstrated--but to no purpose. I demonstrated--in\nvain. I entreated--he smiled. I implored--he laughed. I preached--he\nsneered. I threatened--he swore. I kicked him--he called for the police.\nI pulled his nose--he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil his head\nthat I would not venture to try that experiment again.\n\nPoverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of\nDammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and\nthis was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about\nbetting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that\nI ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “I’ll bet you a\ndollar.” It was usually “I’ll bet you what you please,” or “I’ll bet you\nwhat you dare,” or “I’ll bet you a trifle,” or else, more significantly\nstill, “I’ll bet the Devil my head.”\n\nThis latter form seemed to please him best;--perhaps because it involved\nthe least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious. Had any\none taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have been\nsmall too. But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure\nthat I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the phrase in\nquestion grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of\na man betting his brains like bank-notes:--but this was a point which my\nfriend’s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend.\nIn the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up\nto “I’ll bet the Devil my head,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness\nof devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. I am always\ndispleased by circumstances for which I cannot account. Mysteries\nforce a man to think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there was\nsomething in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to\nhis offensive expression--something in his manner of enunciation--which\nat first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy--something\nwhich, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted\nto call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical,\nMr. Kant pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson\nhyperquizzitistical. I began not to like it at all. Mr. Dammits soul was\nin a perilous state. I resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to\nsave it. I vowed to serve him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is\nsaid to have served the toad,--that is to say, “awaken him to a sense\nof his situation.” I addressed myself to the task forthwith. Once more I\nbetook myself to remonstrance. Again I collected my energies for a final\nattempt at expostulation.\n\nWhen I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit indulged himself in\nsome very equivocal behavior. For some moments he remained silent,\nmerely looking me inquisitively in the face. But presently he threw his\nhead to one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent. Then he\nspread out the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he\nwinked with the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left.\nThen he shut them both up very tight. Then he opened them both so\nvery wide that I became seriously alarmed for the consequences.\nThen, applying his thumb to his nose, he thought proper to make an\nindescribable movement with the rest of his fingers. Finally, setting\nhis arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.\n\nI can call to mind only the beads of his discourse. He would be obliged\nto me if I would hold my tongue. He wished none of my advice. He\ndespised all my insinuations. He was old enough to take care of himself.\nDid I still think him baby Dammit? Did I mean to say any thing against\nhis character? Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool? Was my maternal\nparent aware, in a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence?\nHe would put this latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and\nhe would bind himself to abide by my reply. Once more he would demand\nexplicitly if my mother knew that I was out. My confusion, he said,\nbetrayed me, and he would be willing to bet the Devil his head that she\ndid not.\n\nMr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he\nleft my presence with undignified precipitation. It was well for him\nthat he did so. My feelings had been wounded. Even my anger had been\naroused. For once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. I\nwould have won for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit’s little head--for the fact\nis, my mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from\nhome.\n\nBut Khoda shefa midêhed--Heaven gives relief--as the Mussulmans say when\nyou tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I had\nbeen insulted, and I bore the insult like a man. It now seemed to me,\nhowever, that I had done all that could be required of me, in the case\nof this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no longer\nwith my counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. But\nalthough I forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself\nto give up his society altogether. I even went so far as to humor some\nof his less reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I\nfound myself lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with\ntears in my eyes:--so profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.\n\nOne fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led\nus in the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to\ncross it. It was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and\nthe archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark.\nAs we entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and\nthe interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those\nof the unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was\nhipped. He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively\nlively--so much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy\nsuspicion. It is not impossible that he was affected with the\ntranscendentals. I am not well enough versed, however, in the diagnosis\nof this disease to speak with decision upon the point; and unhappily\nthere were none of my friends of the “Dial” present. I suggest the idea,\nnevertheless, because of a certain species of austere Merry-Andrewism\nwhich seemed to beset my poor friend, and caused him to make quite a\nTom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve him but wriggling and skipping\nabout under and over every thing that came in his way; now shouting\nout, and now lisping out, all manner of odd little and big words, yet\npreserving the gravest face in the world all the time. I really could\nnot make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him. At length, having\npassed nearly across the bridge, we approached the termination of the\nfootway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile of some height.\nThrough this I made my way quietly, pushing it around as usual. But this\nturn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit. He insisted upon leaping\nthe stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the air. Now\nthis, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The best\npigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and as\nI knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done\nby Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a\nbraggadocio, and could not do what he said. For this I had reason to be\nsorry afterward;--for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his head\nthat he could.\n\nI was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some\nremonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a\nslight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ahem!” I\nstarted, and looked about me in surprise. My glance at length fell into\na nook of the frame--work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a little\nlame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing could be more reverend\nthan his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of black,\nbut his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly down\nover a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a girl’s.\nHis hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and his two\neyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.\n\nUpon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk\napron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very\nodd. Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a\ncircumstance, he interrupted me with a second “ahem!”\n\nTo this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply. The fact\nis, remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. I have known\na Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word “Fudge!” I am not ashamed to\nsay, therefore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance.\n\n“Dammit,” said I, “what are you about? don’t you hear?--the gentleman\nsays ‘ahem!’” I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him;\nfor, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is\nparticularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he\nis pretty sure to look like a fool.\n\n“Dammit,” observed I--although this sounded very much like an oath, than\nwhich nothing was further from my thoughts--“Dammit,” I suggested--“the\ngentleman says ‘ahem!’”\n\nI do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did\nnot think it profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our\nspeeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own\neyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb,\nor knocked him in the head with the “Poets and Poetry of America,” he\ncould hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with\nthose simple words: “Dammit, what are you about?--don’t you hear?--the\ngentleman says ‘ahem!’”\n\n“You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning more colors than\na pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. “Are\nyou quite sure he said that? Well, at all events I am in for it now, and\nmay as well put a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then--ahem!”\n\nAt this the little old gentleman seemed pleased--God only knows why.\nHe left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a\ngracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially,\nlooking all the while straight up in his face with an air of the most\nunadulterated benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to\nimagine.\n\n“I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit,” said he, with the frankest of\nall smiles, “but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake\nof mere form.”\n\n“Ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying\na pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable\nalteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down\nthe corners of his mouth--“ahem!” And “ahem!” said he again, after a\npause; and not another word more than “ahem!” did I ever know him to say\nafter that. “Aha!” thought I, without expressing myself aloud--“this is\nquite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt\na consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. One extreme\ninduces another. I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable\nquestions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave\nhim my last lecture? At all events, he is cured of the transcendentals.”\n\n“Ahem!” here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts,\nand looking like a very old sheep in a revery.\n\nThe old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the\nshade of the bridge--a few paces back from the turnstile. “My good\nfellow,” said he, “I make it a point of conscience to allow you this\nmuch run. Wait here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may\nsee whether you go over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t\nomit any flourishes of the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you know. I will\nsay ‘one, two, three, and away.’ Mind you, start at the word ‘away’”\n Here he took his position by the stile, paused a moment as if in\nprofound reflection, then looked up and, I thought, smiled very\nslightly, then tightened the strings of his apron, then took a long look\nat Dammit, and finally gave the word as agreed upon-\n\n            _One--two--three--and--away!_\n\nPunctually at the word “away,” my poor friend set off in a strong\ngallop. The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord’s--nor yet very low,\nlike that of Mr. Lord’s reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure\nthat he would clear it. And then what if he did not?--ah, that was\nthe question--what if he did not? “What right,” said I, “had the\nold gentleman to make any other gentleman jump? The little old\ndot-and-carry-one! who is he? If he asks me to jump, I won’t do it,\nthat’s flat, and I don’t care who the devil he is.” The bridge, as I\nsay, was arched and covered in, in a very ridiculous manner, and there\nwas a most uncomfortable echo about it at all times--an echo which I\nnever before so particularly observed as when I uttered the four last\nwords of my remark.\n\nBut what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an\ninstant. In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had\ntaken the leap. I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor\nof the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he\nwent up. I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration\njust over the top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually\nsingular thing that he did not continue to go over. But the whole leap\nwas the affair of a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any\nprofound reflections, down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back,\non the same side of the stile from which he had started. At the same\ninstant I saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed,\nhaving caught and wrapt up in his apron something that fell heavily into\nit from the darkness of the arch just over the turnstile. At all this\nI was much astonished; but I had no leisure to think, for Dammit lay\nparticularly still, and I concluded that his feelings had been hurt, and\nthat he stood in need of my assistance. I hurried up to him and found\nthat he had received what might be termed a serious injury. The truth\nis, he had been deprived of his head, which after a close search I could\nnot find anywhere; so I determined to take him home and send for the\nhomoeopathists. In the meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open\nan adjacent window of the bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at\nonce. About five feet just above the top of the turnstile, and crossing\nthe arch of the foot-path so as to constitute a brace, there extended a\nflat iron bar, lying with its breadth horizontally, and forming one of\na series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent.\nWith the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my\nunfortunate friend had come precisely in contact.\n\nHe did not long survive his terrible loss. The homoeopathists did not\ngive him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he\nhesitated to take. So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a\nlesson to all riotous livers. I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked\na bar sinister on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses\nof his funeral, sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists.\nThe scoundrels refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once,\nand sold him for dog’s meat.\n\n","He's a real nowhere man\nSitting in his nowhere land\nMaking all his nowhere plans for nobody\n\nDoesn't have a point of view\nKnows not where he's going to\nIsn't he a bit like you and me?\nNowhere man please listen\nYou don't know what you're missing\nNowhere man, The world is at your command\n\nHe's as blind as he can be\nJust sees what he wants to see\nNowhere man, can you see me at all\nNowhere man don't worry\nTake your time, don't hurry\nLeave it all till somebody else\nLends you a hand\n\nDoesn't have a point of view\nKnows not where he's going to\nIsn't he a bit like you and me?\nNowhere man please listen\nYou don't know what you're missing\nNowhere man, The world is at your command\n\n","Article 1201: Scope and Coverage\n1.

I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy.\nInstead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed,\nit occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a\nmouthful of supper and go immediately to bed.\n\nA light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit. More\nthan a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable. Still,\nthere can be no material objection to two. And really between two and\nthree, there is merely a single unit of difference. I ventured, perhaps,\nupon four. My wife will have it five;--but, clearly, she has confounded\ntwo very distinct affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to\nadmit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout,\nwithout which, in the way of condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.\n\nHaving thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the\nserene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon\nthe pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a\nprofound slumber forthwith.\n\nBut when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? I could not have\ncompleted my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the\nstreet-door bell, and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which\nawakened me at once. In a minute afterward, and while I was still\nrubbing my eyes, my wife thrust in my face a note, from my old friend,\nDoctor Ponnonner. It ran thus:\n\n      “Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you\n receive this. Come and help us to rejoice. At last, by long persevering\n diplomacy, I have gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum,\n to my examination of the Mummy--you know the one I mean. I have\n permission to unswathe it and open it, if desirable. A few friends only\n will be present--you, of course. The Mummy is now at my house, and we\n shall begin to unroll it at eleven to-night.\n\n           “Yours, ever,\n\n                   PONNONNER.\n\nBy the time I had reached the “Ponnonner,” it struck me that I was\nas wide awake as a man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy,\noverthrowing all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly\nmarvellous; and set off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor’s.\n\nThere I found a very eager company assembled. They had been awaiting me\nwith much impatience; the Mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and\nthe moment I entered its examination was commenced.\n\nIt was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain\nArthur Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner’s from a tomb near Eleithias, in\nthe Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile.\nThe grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban\nsepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more\nnumerous illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians. The chamber\nfrom which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such\nillustrations; the walls being completely covered with fresco paintings\nand bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich patterns,\nindicated the vast wealth of the deceased.\n\nThe treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same\ncondition in which Captain Sabretash had found it;--that is to say,\nthe coffin had not been disturbed. For eight years it had thus stood,\nsubject only externally to public inspection. We had now, therefore,\nthe complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very\nrarely the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident,\nat once that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good\nfortune.\n\nApproaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven\nfeet long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. It\nwas oblong--not coffin-shaped. The material was at first supposed to\nbe the wood of the sycamore (_platanus_), but, upon cutting into it, we\nfound it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, _papier mache_, composed\nof papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings, representing\nfuneral scenes, and other mournful subjects--interspersed among which,\nin every variety of position, were certain series of hieroglyphical\ncharacters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the departed. By good\nluck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no difficulty in\ntranslating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and represented the\nword _Allamistakeo_.\n\nWe had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury;\nbut having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second,\ncoffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one,\nbut resembling it precisely in every other respect. The interval between\nthe two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the\ncolors of the interior box.\n\nUpon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a\nthird case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no\nparticular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still\nemitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood. Between\nthe second and the third case there was no interval--the one fitting\naccurately within the other.\n\nRemoving the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself.\nWe had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or\nbandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath,\nmade of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and\npainted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the\nvarious supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different\ndivinities, with numerous identical human figures, intended, very\nprobably, as portraits of the persons embalmed. Extending from head\nto foot was a columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic\nhieroglyphics, giving again his name and titles, and the names and\ntitles of his relations.\n\nAround the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass\nbeads, diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities,\nof the scarabaeus, etc, with the winged globe. Around the small of the\nwaist was a similar collar or belt.\n\nStripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation,\nwith no perceptible odor. The color was reddish. The skin was hard,\nsmooth, and glossy. The teeth and hair were in good condition. The eyes\n(it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were\nvery beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat\ntoo determined a stare. The fingers and the nails were brilliantly\ngilded.\n\nMr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the\nembalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping\nthe surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of\nthe powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented\ngums became apparent.\n\nWe searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through\nwhich the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could\ndiscover none. No member of the party was at that period aware that\nentire or unopened mummies are not infrequently met. The brain it\nwas customary to withdraw through the nose; the intestines through an\nincision in the side; the body was then shaved, washed, and salted; then\nlaid aside for several weeks, when the operation of embalming, properly\nso called, began.\n\nAs no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor Ponnonner was preparing\nhis instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past\ntwo o’clock. Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination\nuntil the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present,\nwhen some one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.\n\nThe application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years\nold at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently\noriginal, and we all caught it at once. About one-tenth in earnest and\nnine-tenths in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor’s study, and\nconveyed thither the Egyptian.\n\nIt was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some\nportions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity\nthan other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of\ncourse, gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in\ncontact with the wire. This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive,\nand, with a hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each\nother good night, when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the\nMummy, were there immediately riveted in amazement. My brief glance, in\nfact, had sufficed to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed\nto be glass, and which were originally noticeable for a certain wild\nstare, were now so far covered by the lids, that only a small portion of\nthe _tunica albuginea_ remained visible.\n\nWith a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately\nobvious to all.\n\nI cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because “alarmed” is,\nin my case, not exactly the word. It is possible, however, that, but for\nthe Brown Stout, I might have been a little nervous. As for the rest\nof the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright\nfright which possessed them. Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied.\nMr. Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. Mr.\nSilk Buckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he\nmade his way, upon all fours, under the table.\n\nAfter the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter\nof course, upon further experiment forthwith. Our operations were now\ndirected against the great toe of the right foot. We made an incision\nover the outside of the exterior _os sesamoideum pollicis pedis,_ and\nthus got at the root of the abductor muscle. Readjusting the battery, we\nnow applied the fluid to the bisected nerves--when, with a movement of\nexceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to\nbring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the\nlimb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner,\nwhich had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a\ncatapult, through a window into the street below.\n\nWe rushed out _en masse_ to bring in the mangled remains of the victim,\nbut had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in an\nunaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more\nthan ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment\nwith vigor and with zeal.\n\nIt was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a\nprofound incision into the tip of the subject’s nose, while the Doctor\nhimself, laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact\nwith the wire.\n\nMorally and physically--figuratively and literally--was the effect\nelectric. In the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked very\nrapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime, in the\nsecond place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the fourth,\nit shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner’s face; in the fifth, turning to\nMessieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, it addressed them, in very capital\nEgyptian, thus:\n\n“I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at\nyour behavior. Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected. He\nis a poor little fat fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive him.\nBut you, Mr. Gliddon--and you, Silk--who have travelled and resided in\nEgypt until one might imagine you to the manner born--you, I say who\nhave been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I\nthink, as you write your mother tongue--you, whom I have always been\nled to regard as the firm friend of the mummies--I really did anticipate\nmore gentlemanly conduct from you. What am I to think of your standing\nquietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? What am I to suppose by\nyour permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins, and my\nclothes, in this wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to come to the\npoint) am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little\nvillain, Doctor Ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?”\n\nIt will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech\nunder the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into\nviolent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon. One of these three\nthings was, I say, to be expected. Indeed each and all of these lines of\nconduct might have been very plausibly pursued. And, upon my word, I am\nat a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor\nthe other. But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit\nof the age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and\nis now usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of\nparadox and impossibility. Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the\nMummy’s exceedingly natural and matter-of-course air that divested his\nwords of the terrible. However this may be, the facts are clear, and no\nmember of our party betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed\nto consider that any thing had gone very especially wrong.\n\nFor my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside,\nout of the range of the Egyptian’s fist. Doctor Ponnonner thrust his\nhands into his breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew\nexcessively red in the face. Mr. Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew\nup the collar of his shirt. Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put\nhis right thumb into the left corner of his mouth.\n\nThe Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and\nat length, with a sneer, said:\n\n“Why don’t you speak, Mr. Buckingham? Did you hear what I asked you, or\nnot? Do take your thumb out of your mouth!”\n\nMr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out\nof the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted\nhis left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.\n\nNot being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly\nto Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms\nwhat we all meant.\n\nMr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the\ndeficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would\nafford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of\nhis very excellent speech.\n\nI may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent\nconversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive\nEgyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other\nuntravelled members of the company)--through the medium, I say, of\nMessieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters. These gentlemen spoke\nthe mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I\ncould not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of\nimages entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger)\nthe two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of\nsensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning.\nMr. Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian\ncomprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon the wall, with\na bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows,\nstanding upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown\nforward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and\nthe mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees. Just in the same way Mr.\nBuckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea “wig,” until\n(at Doctor Ponnonner’s suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and\nconsented to take off his own.\n\nIt will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon’s discourse turned\nchiefly upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling\nand disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any\ndisturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the\nindividual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint\n(for it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little\nmatters were now explained, it might be as well to proceed with\nthe investigation intended. Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his\ninstruments.\n\nIn regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that\nAllamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I\ndid not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the\napologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with\nthe company all round.\n\nWhen this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in\nrepairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel.\nWe sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a\nsquare inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.\n\nIt was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of\nAllamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering--no doubt from the cold. The\nDoctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with\na black dress coat, made in Jennings’ best manner, a pair of sky-blue\nplaid pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of\nbrocade, a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with\nno brim, patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a\npair of whiskers, and a waterfall cravat. Owing to the disparity of size\nbetween the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one),\nthere was some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the\nperson of the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been\nsaid to be dressed. Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led\nhim to a comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell\nupon the spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.\n\nThe conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course,\nexpressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo’s\nstill remaining alive.\n\n“I should have thought,” observed Mr. Buckingham, “that it is high time\nyou were dead.”\n\n“Why,” replied the Count, very much astonished, “I am little more than\nseven hundred years old! My father lived a thousand, and was by no means\nin his dotage when he died.”\n\nHere ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of\nwhich it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly\nmisjudged. It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months\nsince he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.\n\n“But my remark,” resumed Mr. Buckingham, “had no reference to your age\nat the period of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are\nstill a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during\nwhich, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum.”\n\n“In what?” said the Count.\n\n“In asphaltum,” persisted Mr. B.\n\n“Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made\nto answer, no doubt--but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else\nthan the Bichloride of Mercury.”\n\n“But what we are especially at a loss to understand,” said Doctor\nPonnonner, “is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt\nfive thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so\ndelightfully well.”\n\n“Had I been, as you say, dead,” replied the Count, “it is more than\nprobable that dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the\ninfancy of Calvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common\nthing among us in the old days. But the fact is, I fell into catalepsy,\nand it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or\nshould be; they accordingly embalmed me at once--I presume you are aware\nof the chief principle of the embalming process?”\n\n“Why not altogether.”\n\n“Why, I perceive--a deplorable condition of ignorance! Well I cannot\nenter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to\nembalm (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the\nanimal functions subjected to the process. I use the word ‘animal’ in\nits widest sense, as including the physical not more than the moral\nand vital being. I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment\nconsisted, with us, in the immediately arresting, and holding in\nperpetual abeyance, all the animal functions subjected to the process.\nTo be brief, in whatever condition the individual was, at the period of\nembalmment, in that condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune\nto be of the blood of the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see\nme at present.”\n\n“The blood of the Scarabaeus!” exclaimed Doctor Ponnonner.\n\n“Yes. The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the ‘arms,’ of a very\ndistinguished and very rare patrician family. To be ‘of the blood of the\nScarabaeus,’ is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus\nis the insignium. I speak figuratively.”\n\n“But what has this to do with you being alive?”\n\n“Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before\nembalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone\ndid not coincide with the custom. Had I not been a Scarabeus, therefore,\nI should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is\ninconvenient to live.”\n\n“I perceive that,” said Mr. Buckingham, “and I presume that all the\nentire mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei.”\n\n“Beyond doubt.”\n\n“I thought,” said Mr. Gliddon, very meekly, “that the Scarabaeus was one\nof the Egyptian gods.”\n\n“One of the Egyptian _what?”_ exclaimed the Mummy, starting to its feet.\n\n“Gods!” repeated the traveller.\n\n“Mr. Gliddon, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,”\n said the Count, resuming his chair. “No nation upon the face of the\nearth has ever acknowledged more than one god. The Scarabaeus, the Ibis,\netc., were with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the\nsymbols, or media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too\naugust to be more directly approached.”\n\nThere was here a pause. At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor\nPonnonner.\n\n“It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,” said he,\n“that among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of\nthe Scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality?”\n\n“There can be no question of it,” replied the Count; “all the Scarabaei\nembalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now. Even some of those\npurposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and\nstill remain in the tomb.”\n\n“Will you be kind enough to explain,” I said, “what you mean by\n‘purposely so embalmed’?”\n\n“With great pleasure!” answered the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely\nthrough his eye-glass--for it was the first time I had ventured to\naddress him a direct question.\n\n“With great pleasure,” he said. “The usual duration of man’s life, in\nmy time, was about eight hundred years. Few men died, unless by most\nextraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer\nthan a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural\nterm. After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already\ndescribed it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable\ncuriosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of\nscience much advanced, by living this natural term in installments. In\nthe case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of\nthis kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained\nthe age of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then\nget himself carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors\npro tem., that they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of\na certain period--say five or six hundred years. Resuming existence at\nthe expiration of this time, he would invariably find his great work\nconverted into a species of hap-hazard note-book--that is to say, into\na kind of literary arena for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and\npersonal squabbles of whole herds of exasperated commentators.\nThese guesses, etc., which passed under the name of annotations, or\nemendations, were found so completely to have enveloped, distorted, and\noverwhelmed the text, that the author had to go about with a lantern to\ndiscover his own book. When discovered, it was never worth the trouble\nof the search. After re-writing it throughout, it was regarded as the\nbounden duty of the historian to set himself to work immediately\nin correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience, the\ntraditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally\nlived. Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification,\npursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of\npreventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said Doctor Ponnonner at this point, laying his\nhand gently upon the arm of the Egyptian--“I beg your pardon, sir, but\nmay I presume to interrupt you for one moment?”\n\n“By all means, sir,” replied the Count, drawing up.\n\n“I merely wished to ask you a question,” said the Doctor. “You mentioned\nthe historian’s personal correction of traditions respecting his own\nepoch. Pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were\nusually found to be right?”\n\n“The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered\nto be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written\nhistories themselves;--that is to say, not one individual iota of either\nwas ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and radically\nwrong.”\n\n“But since it is quite clear,” resumed the Doctor, “that at least five\nthousand years have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for\ngranted that your histories at that period, if not your traditions\nwere sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the\nCreation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten\ncenturies before.”\n\n“Sir!” said the Count Allamistakeo.\n\nThe Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional\nexplanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. The\nlatter at length said, hesitatingly:\n\n“The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel.\nDuring my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy\nas that the universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had\na beginning at all. I remember once, and once only, hearing something\nremotely hinted, by a man of many speculations, concerning the origin\n_of the human race;_ and by this individual, the very word _Adam_\n(or Red Earth), which you make use of, was employed. He employed\nit, however, in a generical sense, with reference to the spontaneous\ngermination from rank soil (just as a thousand of the lower genera of\ncreatures are germinated)--the spontaneous germination, I say, of five\nvast hordes of men, simultaneously upspringing in five distinct and\nnearly equal divisions of the globe.”\n\nHere, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or\ntwo of us touched our foreheads with a very significant air. Mr. Silk\nBuckingham, first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the\nsinciput of Allamistakeo, spoke as follows:\n\n“The long duration of human life in your time, together with\nthe occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in\ninstallments, must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general\ndevelopment and conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore, that\nwe are to attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in\nall particulars of science, when compared with the moderns, and more\nespecially with the Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the\nEgyptian skull.”\n\n“I confess again,” replied the Count, with much suavity, “that I am\nsomewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of\nscience do you allude?”\n\nHere our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the\nassumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.\n\nHaving heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few\nanecdotes, which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and\nSpurzheim had flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been\nnearly forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very\ncontemptible tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles\nof the Theban savans, who created lice and a great many other similar\nthings.\n\nI here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He\nsmiled rather contemptuously, and said they were.\n\nThis put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard\nto his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had\nnever as yet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information\non this head, I had better consult Ptolemy (whoever Ptolemy is), as well\nas one Plutarch de facie lunae.\n\nI then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in\ngeneral, about the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my\nqueries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow,\nand begged me for God’s sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus. As\nfor the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns\npossessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the\nstyle of the Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer\nthis question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very\nextraordinary way.\n\n“Look at our architecture!” he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of\nboth the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.\n\n“Look,” he cried with enthusiasm, “at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New\nYork! or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the\nCapitol at Washington, D. C.!”--and the good little medical man went\non to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he\nreferred. He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less\nthan four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.\n\nThe Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just\nat that moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal\nbuildings of the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night\nof Time, but the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of\nhis entombment, in a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes. He\nrecollected, however, (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to\nan inferior palace in a kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a\nhundred and forty-four columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and\ntwenty-five feet apart. The approach to this portico, from the Nile,\nwas through an avenue two miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and\nobelisks, twenty, sixty, and a hundred feet in height. The palace itself\n(as well as he could remember) was, in one direction, two miles long,\nand might have been altogether about seven in circuit. Its walls were\nrichly painted all over, within and without, with hieroglyphics. He\nwould not pretend to assert that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor’s\nCapitols might have been built within these walls, but he was by\nno means sure that two or three hundred of them might not have\nbeen squeezed in with some trouble. That palace at Carnac was an\ninsignificant little building after all. He (the Count), however, could\nnot conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity, magnificence, and\nsuperiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as described by the\nDoctor. Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever been seen in\nEgypt or elsewhere.\n\nI here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.\n\n“Nothing,” he replied, “in particular.” They were rather slight, rather\nill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of\ncourse, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which\nthe Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred\nand fifty feet in altitude.\n\nI spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.\n\nHe agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should\nhave gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the\nlittle palace at Carnac.\n\nThis question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea\nof Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon\nwinked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been\nrecently discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the\nGreat Oasis.\n\nI then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and\nasked me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on\nthe obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.\n\nThis disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the\nattack to Metaphysics. We sent for a copy of a book called the “Dial,”\n and read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very\nclear, but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress.\n\nThe Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in\nhis day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but\nit never progressed.\n\nWe then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and\nwere at much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the\nadvantages we enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and\nno king.\n\nHe listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little\namused. When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had\noccurred something of a very similar sort. Thirteen Egyptian provinces\ndetermined all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to\nthe rest of mankind. They assembled their wise men, and concocted the\nmost ingenious constitution it is possible to conceive. For a while they\nmanaged remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious.\nThe thing ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states,\nwith some fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable\ndespotism that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.\n\nI asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.\n\nAs well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.\n\nNot knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the\nEgyptian ignorance of steam.\n\nThe Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. The\nsilent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his\nelbows--told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once--and demanded\nif I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern steam-engine\nis derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de Caus.\n\nWe were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck\nwould have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue,\nand inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the\nmoderns in the all--important particular of dress.\n\nThe Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons,\nand then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up\nclose to his eyes for some minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth\nextended itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember\nthat he said any thing in the way of reply.\n\nHereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy\nwith great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as\na gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the\nmanufacture of either Ponnonner’s lozenges or Brandreth’s pills.\n\nWe looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer--but in vain. It was\nnot forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head. Never was\ntriumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a\ngrace. Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy’s\nmortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave.\n\nUpon getting home I found it past four o’clock, and went immediately\nto bed. It is now ten A.M. I have been up since seven, penning these\nmemoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind. The former I\nshall behold no more. My wife is a shrew. The truth is, I am heartily\nsick of this life and of the nineteenth century in general. I am\nconvinced that every thing is going wrong. Besides, I am anxious to\nknow who will be President in 2045. As soon, therefore, as I shave and\nswallow a cup of coffee, I shall just step over to Ponnonner’s and get\nembalmed for a couple of hundred years.\n\n","So long ago, certain place, certain time, you touched my hand.\nAll the way down to Emmiline, but if our paths never cross, well you know I'm sorry but if I live to see the seven wonders, I'll make a path to the rainbow's end.\nI'll never live to match the beauty again, the rainbow's end.\n\nSo it's hard to find someone with that kind of intensity.\nYou touched my hand I played it cool.\n\nSo long ago, it's a certain time, it's a certain place.\nYou touched my hand and you smiled all the way back you held out your hand.\nIf I hope and I pray, ooh it might work out someday.\nIf I live to see the seven wonders, I'll make a path to the rainbow's end.\nI'll never live to match the beauty again.\n\n","The world has turned and left me here.\nJust where I was before you appeared, and in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face.\n\nI just made love with your sweet memory one thousand times in my head.\nYou said you loved it more than ever.\n\nYou remain turned away, turning further every day.\n\nI talked for hours to your wallet photograph and you just listened.\nYou laughed enchanted by intellect, or maybe you didn't.\n\nYou remain turned away, turning further every day.\n\n","Cus I tot no one go then sj nt sure going not cus got arp Lo.

The Parties recognize the principle that an investor of another Party should be permitted to establish a financial institution in the territory of a Party in the juridical form chosen by such investor.\n2. The Parties also recognize the principle that an investor of another Party should be permitted to participate widely in a Party's market through the ability of such investor to:\n\n(a) provide in that Party's territory a range of financial services through separate financial institutions as may be required by that Party;\n(b) expand geographically in that Party's territory; and\n(c) own financial institutions in that Party's territory without being subject to ownership requirements specific to foreign financial institutions.\n3. Subject to Annex 1403.3, at such time as the United States permits commercial banks of another Party located in its territory to expand through subsidiaries or direct branches into substantially all of the United States market, the Parties shall review and assess market access provided by each Party in relation to the principles in paragraphs 1 and 2 with a view to adopting arrangements permitting investors of another Party to choose the juridical form of establishment of commercial banks.\n4. Each Party shall permit an investor of another Party that does not own or control a financial institution in the Party's territory to establish a financial institution in that territory. A Party may:\n\n(a) require an investor of another Party to incorporate under the Party's law any financial institution it establishes in the Party's territory; or\n(b) impose terms and conditions on establishment that are consistent with Article 1405.\n5. For purposes of this Article, \"investor of another Party\" means an investor of another Party engaged in the business of providing financial services in the territory of that Party.\nArticle 1404: Cross-Border Trade\n1. No Party may adopt any measure restricting any type of cross-border trade in financial services by cross-border financial service providers of another Party that the Party permits on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, except to the extent set out in Section B of the Party's Schedule to Annex VII.\n2. Each Party shall permit persons located in its territory, and its nationals wherever located, to purchase financial services from cross-border financial service providers of another Party located in the territory of that other Party or of another Party. This obligation does not require a Party to permit such providers to do business or solicit in its territory. Subject to paragraph 1, each Party may define \"doing business\" and \"solicitation\" for purposes of this obligation.\n3. Without prejudice to other means of prudential regulation of cross-border trade in financial services, a Party may require the registration of cross-border financial service providers of another Party and of financial instruments.\n4. The Parties shall consult on future liberalization of cross-border trade in financial services as set out in Annex 1404.4.\nArticle 1405: National Treatment\n1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own investors, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments in financial institutions in its territory.\n2. Each Party shall accord to financial institutions of another Party and to investments of investors of another Party in financial institutions treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own financial institutions and to investments of its own investors in financial institutions, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments.\n3. Subject to Article 1404, where a Party permits the cross-border provision of a financial service it shall accord to the cross-border financial service providers of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own financial service providers, in like circumstances, with respect to the provision of such service.\n4. The treatment that a Party is required to accord under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 means, with respect to a measure of any state or province:\n\n(a) in the case of an investor of another Party with an investment in a financial institution, an investment of such investor in a financial institution, or a financial institution of such investor, located in a state or province, treatment no less favorable than the treatment accorded to an investor of the Party in a financial institution, an investment of such investor in a financial institution, or a financial institution of such investor, located in that state or province, in like circumstances; and\n(b) in any other case, treatment no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded to an investor of the Party in a financial institution, its financial institution or its investment in a financial institution, in like circumstances.\nFor greater certainty, in the case of an investor of another Party with investments in financial institutions or financial institutions of such investor, located in more than one state or province, the treatment required under subparagraph (a) means:\n\n(c) treatment of the investor that is no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded to an investor of the Party with an investment located in such states, or provinces in like circumstances; and\n(d) with respect to an investment of the investor in a financial institution or a financial institution of such investor, located in a state or province, treatment no less favorable than that accorded to an investment of an investor of the Party, or a financial institution of such investor, located in that state or province, in like circumstances.\n5. A Party's treatment of financial institutions and cross-border financial service providers of another Party, whether different or identical to that accorded to its own institutions or providers in like circumstances, is consistent with paragraphs 1 through 3 if the treatment affords equal competitive opportunities.\n6. A Party's treatment affords equal competitive opportunities if it does not disadvantage financial institutions and cross-border financial services providers of another Party in their ability to provide financial services as compared with the ability of the Party's own financial institutions and financial services providers to provide such services, in like circumstances.\n7. Differences in market share, profitability or size do not in themselves establish a denial of equal competitive opportunities, but such differences may be used as evidence regarding whether a Party's treatment affords equal competitive opportunities.\nArticle 1406: Most-Favored-Nation Treatment\n1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party, financial institutions of another Party, investments of investors in financial institutions and cross-border financial service providers of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords to the investors, financial institutions, investments of investors in financial institutions and cross-border financial service providers of any other Party or of a non-Party, in like circumstances.\n2. A Party may recognize prudential measures of another Party or of a non-Party in the application of measures covered by this Chapter. Such recognition may be:\n\n(a) accorded unilaterally;\n(b) achieved through harmonization or other means; or\n(c) based upon an agreement or arrangement with the other Party or non-Party.\n3. A Party according recognition of prudential measures under paragraph 2 shall provide adequate opportunity to another Party to demonstrate that circumstances exist in which there are or would be equivalent regulation, oversight, implementation of regulation, and if appropriate, procedures concerning the sharing of information between the Parties.\n4. Where a Party accords recognition of prudential measures under paragraph 2(c); and the circumstances set out in paragraph 3 exist, the Party shall provide adequate opportunity to another Party to negotiate accession to the agreement or arrangement, or to negotiate a comparable agreement or arrangement.\nArticle 1407: New Financial Services and Data Processing\n1.

Where such authorization is required, a decision shall be made within a reasonable time and the authorization may only be refused for prudential reasons.\n2. Each Party shall permit a financial institution of another Party to transfer information in electronic or other form, into and out of the Party's territory, for data processing where such processing is required in the ordinary course of business of such institution.\nArticle 1408: Senior Management and Boards of Directors\n1. No Party may require financial institutions of another Party to engage individuals of any particular nationality as senior managerial or other essential personnel.\n2.

Articles 1403 through 1408 do not apply to any non-conforming measure that a Party adopts or maintains in accordance with Section B of its Schedule to Annex VII.\n3.

Where a Party has set out a reservation to Article 1102, 1103, 1202 or 1203 in its Schedule to Annex I, II, III or IV, the reservation shall be deemed to constitute a reservation to Article 1405 or 1406, as the case may be, to the extent that the measure, sector, subsector or activity set out in the reservation is covered by this Chapter.\nArticle 1410: Exceptions\n\n1. Nothing in this Part shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining reasonable measures for prudential reasons, such as:\n\n(a) the protection of investors, depositors, financial market participants, policyholders, policy claimants, or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial institution or cross-border financial service provider;\n(b) the maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions or cross-border financial service providers; and\n(c) ensuring the integrity and stability of a Party's financial system.\n2.

This paragraph shall not affect a Party's obligations under Article 1106 (Investment Performance Requirements) with respect to measures covered by Chapter Eleven (Investment) or Article 1109 (Investments Transfers).\n3. Article 1405 shall not apply to the granting by a Party to a financial institution of an exclusive right to provide a financial service referred to in Article 1401(3)(a).\n4. Notwithstanding Article 1109(1), (2) and (3), as incorporated into this Chapter, and without limiting the applicability of Article 1109(4), as incorporated into this Chapter, a Party may prevent or limit transfers by a financial institution or cross-border financial services provider to, or for the benefit of, an affiliate of or person related to such institution or provider, through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of measures relating to maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions or cross-border financial service providers. This paragraph does not prejudice any other provision of this Agreement that permits a Party to restrict transfers.\nArticle 1411: Transparency\n1. In lieu of Article 1802(2) (Publication), each Party shall, to the extent practicable, provide in advance to all interested persons any measure of general application that the Party proposes to adopt in order to allow an opportunity for such persons to comment on the measure.

Where it is not practicable for a decision to be made within 120 days, the regulatory authority shall notify the applicant without undue delay and shall endeavor to make the decision within a reasonable time thereafter.\n5. Nothing in this Chapter requires a Party to furnish or allow access to:\n\n(a) information related to the financial affairs and accounts of individual customers of financial institutions or cross-border financial service providers; or\n(b) any confidential information, the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or prejudice legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises.\n6.

We had done plenty of weed and X, but neither of us had ever had the connection or the interest to get acid. When we discovered our friends had some acid left over from the night before, (it was a pretty big priority for us to have the LSD tested by a reliable source) we pitched in some money and purchased 8 hits, which were dropped on gummi peaches. We weren't spending the night, and drove home to make the midnight curfew my mom had imposed on us.\n\nWhen we were about 30 minutes from home, we decided to go ahead and each take 2 of our 4 hits, even though we knew we would have to be talking to my mom. Then we hit traffic on the interstate, even though it was 11:00 PM, and I started to get a little uneasy. About 10 minutes from home, and 40 minutes after we first dropped the hits, we both started to giggle. Driving became extremely fun for my friend, who informed me that he would not be able to stop laughing when my mom answered the door.\n\n1 hour after dropping:\nWe stifled laughter as we pushed past my mom into the basement, where we would be spending the night. I quickly ran downstairs and turned on the TV, anxious for my mom to go to bed. I soon realized my friend wasn't behind me. Tracing my steps backwards, I found him sitting in the stairway staring at a mural of some birds.\n'Are you seeing this?' he asked me.\nLooking at the mural to see what he was talking about, I saw the trees begin to sway and the birds take flight. Knowing we were going to be in for a long night, I pulled him down to the couch where we waited for my mom to go to bed.\n\n2 hours after dropping:\nThe state of mind I found myself in was extremely interesting. My friend was repeatedly trying to get me to call another friend to act as 'ground control,' for he explained to me that he would periodically lose all concept of who he was or the situation he was in. I was comfortable with my surroundings, and as I described it to him 'in my element.' I found myself in the bathroom staring in the mirror, my friend was standing beside me but had changed into a completely different person. Staring at his face for a period of about a minute would find him changing into 4 different people, an elf, and a dog. (I find myself still, several months later, able to change his face with some concentration when I am really high)\n\nThe one thing that I cannot stress enough about LSD induced hallucinations is how real they seem. I have seen things with weed before, but never with the detail and clarity which I experienced on acid. The people I saw my friend change into I had never seen before, but each one of them held very distinct features and detail in the face, and when he spoke the words would be spoken by whatever person I was currently seeing. It was truly amazing to me. I then turned to the mirror, and immediately saw my face melt and distort itself into hideous images. Reading through several trip accounts before attempting LSD, I found it fascinating the relative ease and comfort which people viewed these terrifying images they described. Experiencing this first hand, I felt a strange sense of safety while seeing this, knowing that I was on acid and this was all part of the experience. Having said this, I can easily see how bad trips develop and cannot stress the importance of knowing what you are getting into and being in a comfortable environment. (ie. your basement)\n\nAs I continued to look into the mirror I became unable to distinguish which side of the mirror I was on, and felt as though I was inside looking out. As I placed my head against the mirror and stared into my own eyes, I would shift in and out of the correct side of the mirror, momentarily losing grip on reality.\n\n3.5 hours after dropping:\nThe decision to go outside was made out of sheer wonder and curiosity. Seeming to have the opposite effect of weed, the acid seemed to OVER calm our fears so that we were not neccesarily as careful as we probably should have been. Nevertheless, after a very interesting walk we ended up in the middle of my cul-de-sac. Light was everywhere. The whole cul-de-sac was illuminated in red, blue, and white light. We continually thought we saw headlights, but instead of running or hiding we stared awestruck. As my friend described how the cement had transformed itself into a Roman tiling, I witnessed a very different scene. The cul-de-sac had appeared to be the scene of an earthquake, the ground had wide cracks and the car parked in front of my house seemed to be sinking into the ground. Reality was not a concern of mine, and we did not contemplate at the time how strange we must of looked standing in the middle of the cul-de-sac staring at things. We remained outside for a couple of hours, as thoughts and emotions raced through our head only to be gone and forgotten a couple of seconds later.\n\nAfter we had our fill, we began to walk back to the basement. The walk back was probably the only part of the trip that bordered on frightening, because with each step the door seemed to get farther away and once we arrived the entrance to the basement seemed very ominous.\n\n6.5 hours after dropping:\nWe sat down and watched a little TV, and had a great time laughing at the visions we shared of people protruding from the television set. About 7.5 or 8 hours since we began, we could feel reality coming back to us. I first began to sense it in that I began to smell and taste the real world. It is difficult to describe, but just the taste of my mouth and the normal smells of my house were things that had become lost during the trip, and were now beginning to ground me. I went upstairs fearing the sleeplessness (I had to work the next morning), but found myself able to sleep within 30 minutes) The next day at work found me 'not quite there,' but everything did seem a little brighter.\n\nLSD did not provide the euphoria that MDMA does, so if you are looking to FEEL amazing it may not be for you. However, it does make for a great 8 hour adventure. \n\n","I just finish bathing myself.

Addresses in Durban and Verulam referred to Gandhi as a 'Mahatma', 'great soul'. He was seen as a great soul because he had taken up the poor's cause.

Born and raised in a Hindu merchant caste family in coastal Gujarat, western India, and trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, Gandhi first employed nonviolent civil disobedience as an expatriate lawyer in South Africa, in the resident Indian community's struggle for civil rights. After his return to India in 1915, he set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for various social causes and for achieving Swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi famously led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km Dandi Salt March in 1930, and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned for many years, upon many occasions, in both South Africa and India. He lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn hand-spun on a charkha. He ate simple vegetarian food, and also undertook long fasts as a means of both self-purification and political protest. Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism, however, was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India.<ref name=Khan2007-page1> Quote: \"the Muslim League had only caught on among South Asian Muslims during the Second World War. ... By the late 1940s, the League and the Congress had impressed in the British their own visions of a free future for Indian people. ... one, articulated by the Congress, rested on the idea of a united, plural India as a home for all Indians and the other, spelt out by the League, rested on the foundation of Muslim nationalism and the carving out of a separate Muslim homeland. \" (p. 18) Eventually, in August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan.<ref name=autogenerated3> Quote: \"South Asians learned that the British Indian empire would be partitioned on 3 June 1947. They heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and, later, through government pamphlets.

For some, the butchery and forced relocation of the summer months of 1947 may have been the first they know about the creation of the two new states rising from the fragmentary and terminally weakened British empire in India. \" (p. 1) As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide solace. In the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to stop religious violence. The last of these, undertaken on 12 January 1948 when he was 78,<ref name=Brown1991-p380>Brown, p. 380: \"Despite and indeed because of his sense of helplessness Delhi was to be the scene of what he called his greatest fast. ...

He said he would fast until communal peace was restored, real peace rather than the calm of a dead city imposed by police and troops. Patel and the government took the fast partly as condemnation of their decision to withhold a considerable cash sum still outstanding to Pakistan as a result of the allocation of undivided India's assets, because the hostilities that had broken out in Kashmir; ... But even when the government agreed to pay out the cash, Gandhi would not break his fast: that he would only do after a large number of important politicians and leaders of communal bodies agreed to a joint plan for restoration of normal life in the city. \" also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating. Among them was Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, who assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest.<ref name=\"CushRobinson2008\"> Quote: \"The apotheosis of this contrast is the assassination of Gandhi in 1948 by a militant Nathuram Godse, on the basis of his 'weak' accommodationist approach towards the new state of Pakistan. Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence.\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 to a Hindu Modh Baniya family in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the Indian Empire. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the diwan (chief minister) of Porbandar state. Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister. During his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family. Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade, a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860 – March 1914), a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960) and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913). On 2 October 1869, Putlibai gave birth to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city. As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as \"restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears. \" The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, he admits that they left an indelible impression on his mind. He writes: \"It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number. \" Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters. The family's religious background was eclectic. Gandhi's father Karamchand was Hindu and his mother Putlibai was from a Pranami Vaishnava Hindu family. Gandhi's father was of Modh Baniya caste in the varna of Vaishya. His mother came from the medieval Krishna bhakti-based Pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the Bhagavad Gita, the Bhagavata Purana, and a collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the Vedas, the Quran and the Bible. Gandhi was deeply influenced by his mother, an extremely pious lady who \"would not think of taking her meals without her daily prayers...she would take the hardest vows and keep them without flinching. To keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her. \" In 1874, Gandhi's father Karamchand left Porbandar for the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, the British regional political agency was located there, which gave the state's diwan a measure of security. In 1876, Karamchand became diwan of Rajkot and was succeeded as diwan of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. His family then rejoined him in Rajkot. At age 9, Gandhi entered the local school in Rajkot, near his home. There he studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language and geography. At age 11, he joined the High School in Rajkot. He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue tied student, with no interest in games; his only companions were books and school lessons. While at high school, Gandhi's elder brother introduced him to a Muslim friend named Sheikh Mehtab. Mehtab was older in age, taller and encouraged the strictly vegetarian boy to eat meat to gain height. He also took Mohandas to a brothel one day, though Mohandas \"was struck blind and dumb in this den of vice,\" rebuffed the prostitutes' advances and was promptly sent out of the brothel. The experience caused Mohandas mental anguish, and he abandoned the company of Mehtab. In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadia (her first name was usually shortened to \"Kasturba\", and affectionately to \"Ba\") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time. In the process, he lost a year at school, but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, \"As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives. \" However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband. Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, \"even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me. \" He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her. In late 1885, Gandhi's father Karamchand died. Gandhi, then 16 years old, and his wife of age 17 had their first baby, who survived only a few days. The two deaths anguished Gandhi. The Gandhi couple had four more children, all sons: Harilal, born in 1888; Manilal, born in 1892; Ramdas, born in 1897; and Devdas, born in 1900. In November 1887, the 18-year-old Gandhi graduated from high school in Ahmedabad. In January 1888, he enrolled at Samaldas College in Bhavnagar State, then the sole degree-granting institution of higher education in the region. But he dropped out and returned to his family in Porbandar.\nGandhi came from a poor family, and he had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal. His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing. On 10 August 1888, Gandhi aged 18, left Porbandar for Mumbai, then known as Bombay. Upon arrival, he stayed with the local Modh Bania community while waiting for the ship travel arrangements. The head of the community knew Gandhi's father. After learning Gandhi's plans, he and other elders warned Gandhi that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways. Gandhi informed them of his promise to his mother and her blessings. The local chief disregarded it, and excommunicated him an outcast. But Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London. His brother saw him off. In London, Gandhi studied law and jurisprudence and enrolled at the Inner Temple with the intention of becoming a barrister. His childhood shyness and self withdrawal had continued through his teens, and he remained so when he arrived in London, but he joined a public speaking practice group and overcame this handicap to practise law. His time in London was influenced by the vow he had made to his mother. He tried to adopt \"English\" customs, including taking dancing lessons. However, he could not appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by Henry Salt's writing, he joined the Vegetarian Society, was elected to its executive committee, and started a local Bayswater chapter. Some of the vegetarians he met were members of the Theosophical Society, which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of Buddhist and Hindu literature. They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the Bhagavad Gita both in translation as well as in the original. Gandhi, at age 22, was called to the bar in June 1891 and then left London for India, where he learned that his mother had died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from him. His attempts at establishing a law practice in Bombay failed because he was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses. He returned to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but he was forced to stop when he ran afoul of a British officer. In 1893, a Muslim merchant in Kathiawar named Dada Abdullah contacted Gandhi. Abdullah owned a large successful shipping business in South Africa. His distant cousin in Johannesburg needed a lawyer, and they preferred someone with Kathiawari heritage. Gandhi inquired about his pay for the work. They offered a total salary of £105 plus travel expenses. He accepted it, knowing that it would be at least one year commitment in the Colony of Natal, South Africa, also a part of the British Empire.\nIn April 1893, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin. He spent 21 years in South Africa, where he developed his political views, ethics and politics. Immediately upon arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination because of his skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning. When Gandhi arrived in South Africa, according to Herman, he thought of himself as \"a Briton first, and an Indian second\". However, the prejudice against him and his fellow Indians from British people that Gandhi experienced and observed deeply bothered him. He found it humiliating, struggling to understand how some people can feel honour or superiority or pleasure in such inhumane practices. Gandhi began to question his people's standing in the British Empire. The Abdullah case that had brought him to South Africa concluded in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi as he prepared to return to India. However, a new Natal government discriminatory proposal led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. He planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill. Though unable to halt the bill's passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the Natal Indian Congress in 1894, and through this organisation, he moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him and he escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. However, he refused to press charges against any member of the mob. During the Boer War, Gandhi volunteered in 1900 to form a group of stretcher-bearers as the Natal Indian Ambulance Corps. According to Arthur Herman, Gandhi wanted to disprove the imperial British stereotype that Hindus were not fit for \"manly\" activities involving danger and exertion, unlike the Muslim \"martial races\". Gandhi raised eleven hundred Indian volunteers, to support British combat troops against the Boers. They were trained and medically certified to serve on the front lines. They were auxiliaries at the Battle of Colenso to a White volunteer ambulance corps; then at Spion Kop Gandhi and his bearers moved to the front line and had to carry wounded soldiers for miles to a field hospital because the terrain was too rough for the ambulances. Gandhi and thirty-seven other Indians received the Queen's South Africa Medal. In 1906, the Transvaal government promulgated a new Act compelling registration of the colony's Indian and Chinese populations. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of Satyagraha (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, for the first time. According to Anthony Parel, Gandhi was also influenced by the Tamil text Tirukkuṛaḷ because Leo Tolstoy mentioned it in their correspondence that began with A Letter to a Hindu. Gandhi urged Indians to defy the new law and to suffer the punishments for doing so. Gandhi's ideas of protests, persuasion skills and public relations had emerged. He took these back to India in 1915.\nGandhi focused his attention on Indians while in South Africa. He was not interested in politics. This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, in some cases distressing to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a parasite, semi-barbarous, canker, squalid coolie, yellow man, and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate. While in South Africa, Gandhi focused on racial persecution of Indians, ignored those of Africans. In some cases, state Desai and Vahed, his behaviour was one of being a willing part of racial stereotyping and African exploitation. In a speech in September 1896 in India, for example, Gandhi complained the whites in British colony of South Africa were degrading Indian Hindus and Muslims to \"a level of Kaffir\". Scholars cite it as an example evidence that Gandhi at that time felt about Indians and black South Africans differently. As another example given by Herman, Gandhi, at age 24, prepared a legal brief for the Natal Assembly in 1895, seeking voting rights for Indians. Gandhi cited race history and European Orientalists' opinions that \"Anglo-Saxons and Indians are sprung from the same Aryan stock or rather the Indo-European peoples\", and argued that Indians should not be grouped with the Africans. Years later, Gandhi and his colleagues served and helped Africans as nurses and by opposing racism, according to the Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela. The general image of Gandhi, state Desai and Vahed, has been reinvented since his assassination as if he was always a saint, when in reality his life was more complex, contained inconvenient truths and was one that evolved over time. In contrast, other Africa scholars state the evidence points to a rich history of co-operation and efforts by Gandhi and Indian people with nonwhite South Africans against persecution of Africans and the Apartheid. In 1906, when the British declared war against the Zulu Kingdom in Natal, Gandhi at age 36, sympathised with the Zulus, and encouraged the Indian volunteers to help as an ambulance unit. He argued that Indians should participate in the war efforts to change attitudes and perceptions of the British people against the coloured people. Gandhi, a group of 20 Indians and black people of South Africa volunteered as a stretcher-bearer corps to treat wounded British soldiers and the opposite side of the war: Zulu victims. White soldiers stopped Gandhi and team from treating the injured Zulu, and some African stretcher-bearers with Gandhi were shot dead by the British. The medical team commanded by Gandhi operated for less than two months. Gandhi volunteering to help as a \"staunch loyalist\" during the Zulu and other wars made no difference in the British attitude, states Herman, and the African experience was a part of his great disillusionment with the West, transforming him into an \"uncompromising non-cooperator\". In 1910, Gandhi established an idealistic community called 'Tolstoy Farm' near Johannesburg, where he nurtured his policy of peaceful resistance. In the years after black South Africans gained the right to vote in South Africa, Gandhi was proclaimed a national hero with numerous monuments.\nAt the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to him by C. F. Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser. Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian. Gandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947 the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.\nIn April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi. Gandhi agreed to actively recruit Indians for the war effort. In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled \"Appeal for Enlistment\", Gandhi wrote \"To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them...If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army. \" He did, however, stipulate in a letter to the Viceroy's private secretary that he \"personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe. \" Gandhi's war recruitment campaign brought into question his consistency on nonviolence. Gandhi's private secretary noted that \"The question of the consistency between his creed of 'Ahimsa' (nonviolence) and his recruiting campaign was raised not only then but has been discussed ever since. \"\nGandhi's first major achievement came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were backed by the local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow Indigo, a cash crop whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.\nIn 1918, Kheda was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel. Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused but finally in end-May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.\nIn 1919, Gandhi then aged 49, after the World War I was over, sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the Ottoman Empire that had been defeated in the World War. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917–18. Gandhi had already supported the British crown with resources and by recruiting Indian soldiers to fight the war in Europe on the British side. This effort of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I. The British government, instead of self government, had offered minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi. Gandhi announced his satyagraha (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the Rowlatt Act, to block Gandhi's movement. The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for \"preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial\". Gandhi felt that Hindu-Muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the British. He leveraged the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (ummah). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the Sunni Islamic Caliph in Turkey. , Quote: \"Rabindranath Tagore heavily criticized Gandhi at the time in private letters . They reveal Tagore's belief that Gandhi had committed the Indian political nation to a cause that was mistakenly anti-Western and fundamentally negative\"; The increasing Muslim support for Gandhi, after he championed the Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt satyagraha demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi's stature as the political leader to the British. His support for the Khilafat movement also helped him sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced his opposition to the satyagraha non-cooperation movement approach of Gandhi. Jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan. By the end of 1922 the Khilafat movement had collapsed. Turkey's Ataturk had ended the Caliphate, Khilafat movement ended, and Muslim support for Gandhi largely evaporated. Muslim leaders and delegates abandoned Gandhi and his Congress. Hindu-Muslim communal conflicts reignited. Deadly religious riots re-appeared in numerous cities, with 91 in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh alone.\nWith his book Hind Swaraj Gandhi, aged 40, declared that British rule was established in India with the co-operation of Indians and had survived only because of this co-operation. If Indians refused to co-operate, British rule would collapse and swaraj would come. Mary Elizabeth King, \"Mohandas K, Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Bequest: Nonviolent Civil Resistance in a Globalized World\" in In February 1919, Gandhi cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable communication that if the British were to pass the Rowlatt Act, he will appeal Indians to start civil disobedience. The British government ignored him, passed the law stating it will not yield to threats. The satyagraha civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in satyagraha in Delhi. People rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, he asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but express their frustration with peace, to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing they own. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side uses violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. Government warned him to not enter Delhi. Gandhi defied the order. On 9 April, Gandhi was arrested. People rioted. On 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and a British officer named Reginald Dyer surrounded them and ordered his troops to fire on them. The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent, but was cheered by some Britons and parts of the British media as an appropriate response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using love to deal with the hate of the British government. Gandhi demanded that people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting. The massacre and Gandhi's non-violent response to it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott. The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi to the belief that Indians will never get a fair equal treatment under British rulers, and he shifted his attention to Swaraj or self rule and political independence for India. In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress. He reorganised the Congress. With Congress now behind him, and Muslim support triggered by his backing the Khilafat movement to restore the Caliph in Turkey, Gandhi had the political support and the attention of the British Raj. Gandhi expanded his nonviolent non-co-operation platform to include the swadeshi policy—the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that khadi (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning khadi in support of the independence movement. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively. The appeal of \"Non-cooperation\" grew, its social popularity drew participation from all strata of Indian society. Gandhi was arrested on 10 March 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He began his sentence on 18 March 1922. With Gandhi isolated in prison, the Indian National Congress split into two factions, one led by Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru favouring party participation in the legislatures, and the other led by Chakravarti Rajagopalachari and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, opposing this move. Furthermore, co-operation among Hindus and Muslims ended as Khilafat movement collapsed with the rise of Ataturk in Turkey. Muslim leaders left the Congress and began forming Muslim organisations. The political base behind Gandhi had broken into factions. Gandhi was released in February 1924 for an appendicitis operation, having served only two years.\nAfter his early release from prison for political crimes in 1924, over the second half of the 1920s, Gandhi continued to pursue swaraj. He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-co-operation with complete independence for the country as its goal. After his support for the World War I with Indian combat troops, and the failure of Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh questioned his values and non-violent approach. While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, Gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two. The British did not respond favourably to Gandhi's proposal. British political leaders such as Lord Birkenhead and Winston Churchill announced opposition to \"the appeasers of Gandhi\", in their discussions with European diplomats who sympathised with Indian demands. On 31 December 1929, the flag of India was unfurled in Lahore. Gandhi led Congress celebrated 26 January 1930 as India's Independence Day in Lahore. This day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organisation. Gandhi then launched a new Satyagraha against the tax on salt in March 1930. This was highlighted by the famous Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April, where he marched 388 km from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself. Thousands of Indians joined him on this march to the sea. This campaign was one of his most successful at upsetting British hold on India; Britain responded by imprisoning over 60,000 people. According to Sarma, Gandhi recruited women to participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield. When women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.\nAccording to Atlury Murali, Indian Congress in the 1920s appealed to Andhra Pradesh peasants by creating Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints. The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure. According to Dennis Dalton, it was the ideas that were responsible for his wide following. Gandhi criticised Western civilisation as one driven by \"brute force and immorality\", contrasting it with his categorisation of Indian civilisation as one driven by \"soul force and morality\". Gandhi captured the imagination of the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning \"hate with love\". These ideas are evidenced in his pamphlets from the 1890s, in South Africa, where too he was popular among the Indian indentured workers. After he returned to India, people flocked to him because he reflected their values. Gandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another. He used terminology and phrases such as Rama-rajya from Ramayana, Prahlada as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of swaraj and satyagraha. These ideas sounded strange outside India, during his lifetime, but they readily and deeply resonated with the culture and historic values of his people.\nThe government, represented by Lord Irwin, decided to negotiate with Gandhi. The Gandhi–Irwin Pact was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin's successor, Lord Willingdon, took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers. In Britain, Winston Churchill, a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister, became a vigorous and articulate critic of Gandhi and opponent of his long-term plans. Churchill often ridiculed Gandhi, saying in a widely reported 1931 speech: Churchill bitterness against Gandhi grew in the 1930s. He called Gandhi as the one who was \"seditious in aim\" whose evil genius and multiform menace was attacking the British empire. Churchill called him a dictator, a \"Hindu Mussolini\", fomenting a race war, trying to replace the Raj with Brahmin cronies, playing on the ignorance of Indian masses, all for selfish gain. Churchill attempted to isolate Gandhi, and his criticism of Gandhi was widely covered by European and American press. It gained Churchill sympathetic support, but it also increased support for Gandhi among Europeans. The developments heightened Churchill's anxiety that the \"British themselves would give up out of pacifism and misplaced conscience\".\nDuring the discussions between Gandhi and the British government over 1931–32 at the Round Table Conferences, Gandhi, now aged about 62, sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians. The British side sought reforms that would keep Indian subcontinent as a colony. The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions. The British questioned Congress party and Gandhi's authority to speak for all of India. They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as B. R. Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables. Gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because he feared that it would not bring people together but divide them, perpetuate their status and divert the attention from India's struggle to end the colonial rule. After Gandhi returned from Second Round Table conference, he started a new satyagraha. He was arrested and imprisoned at the Yerwada Jail, Pune. While he was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate. It came to be known as the Communal Award. In protest, Gandhi started fast-unto-death, while he was held in prison. The resulting public outcry forced the government, in consultations with Ambedkar, to replace the Communal Award with a compromise Poona Pact.\nIn 1934 Gandhi resigned from Congress party membership. He did not disagree with the party's position but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj. Gandhi returned to active politics again in 1936, with the Nehru presidency and the Lucknow session of the Congress. Although Gandhi wanted a total focus on the task of winning independence and not speculation about India's future, he did not restrain the Congress from adopting socialism as its goal. Gandhi had a clash with Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest. Despite Gandhi's opposition, Bose won a second term as Congress President, against Gandhi's nominee, Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya; but left the Congress when the All-India leaders resigned en masse in protest of his abandonment of the principles introduced by Gandhi. Gandhi declared that Sitaramayya's defeat was his defeat.\nGandhi opposed providing any help to the British war effort and he campaigned against any Indian participation in the World War II. Gandhi's campaign did not enjoy the support of Indian masses and many Indian leaders such as Sardar Patel and Rajendra Prasad. His campaign was a failure. Over 2.5 million Indians ignored Gandhi, volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of the allied forces. Gandhi opposition to the Indian participation in the World War II was motivated by his belief that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom while that freedom was denied to India itself. He also condemned Nazism and Fascism, a view which won endorsement of other Indian leaders. As the war progressed, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, calling for the British to Quit India in a 1942 speech in Mumbai. This was Gandhi's and the Congress Party's most definitive revolt aimed at securing the British exit from India. The British government responded quickly to the Quit India speech, and within hours after Gandhi's speech arrested Gandhi and all the members of the Congress Working Committee. His countrymen retaliated the arrests by damaging or burning down hundreds of government owned railway stations, police stations, and cutting down telegraph wires. In 1942, Gandhi now nearing age 73, urged his people to completely stop co-operating with the imperial government. In this effort, he urged that they neither kill nor injure British people, but be willing to suffer and die if violence is initiated by the British officials. He clarified that the movement would not be stopped because of any individual acts of violence, saying that the \"ordered anarchy\" of \"the present system of administration\" was \"worse than real anarchy. \" He urged Indians to Karo ya maro (\"Do or die\") in the cause of their rights and freedoms. Gandhi's arrest lasted two years, as he was held in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this period, his long time secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944; and Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack. While in Jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement. Gandhi was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 because of his failing health and necessary surgery; the Raj did not want him to die in prison and enrage the nation. He came out of detention to an altered political scene—the Muslim League for example, which a few years earlier had appeared marginal, \"now occupied the centre of the political stage\" and the topic of Muhammad Ali Jinnah's campaign for Pakistan was a major talking point. Gandhi and Jinnah had extensive correspondence in 1944, where Gandhi insisted on a united religiously plural India which included Muslims and non-Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. Jinnah rejected this proposal and insisted instead for partitioning the subcontinent on religious lines to create a separate Muslim India (later Pakistan). These discussions continued through 1947. While the leaders of Congress languished in jail, the other parties supported the war and gained organizational strength. Underground publications flailed at the ruthless suppression of Congress, but it had little control over events. At the end of the war, the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point Gandhi called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the Congress's leadership.\nGandhi opposed partition of the Indian subcontinent along religious lines. The Indian National Congress and Gandhi called for the British to Quit India. However, the Muslim League demanded \"Divide and Quit India\". Gandhi suggested an agreement which required the Congress and the Muslim League to co-operate and attain independence under a provisional government, thereafter, the question of partition could be resolved by a plebiscite in the districts with a Muslim majority. Jinnah rejected Gandhi's proposal and called for Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946, to press Muslims to publicly gather in cities and support his proposal for partition of Indian subcontinent into a Muslim state and non-Muslim state. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal – now Bangladesh and West Bengal, gave Calcutta's police special holiday to celebrate the Direct Action Day. The Direct Action Day triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict. The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence. The violence on Direct Action Day led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India. Thousands of Hindus and Muslims were murdered, and tens of thousands were injured in the cycle of violence in the days that followed. Gandhi visited the most riot-prone areas to appeal a stop to the massacres. Archibald Wavell, the Viceroy and Governor-General of British India for three years through February 1947, had worked with Gandhi and Jinnah to find a common ground, before and after accepting Indian independence in principle. Wavell condemned Gandhi's character and motives as well as his ideas. Wavell accused Gandhi of harbouring the single minded idea to \"overthrow British rule and influence and to establish a Hindu raj\", and called Gandhi a \"malignant, malevolent, exceedingly shrewd\" politician. Wavell feared a civil war on the Indian subcontinent, and doubted Gandhi would be able to stop it. The British reluctantly agreed to grant independence to the people of the Indian subcontinent, but accepted Jinnah's proposal of partitioning the land into Pakistan and India. Gandhi was involved in the final negotiations. Stanley Wolpert states the \"plan to carve up British India was never approved of or accepted by Gandhi\". The partition was controversial and violently disputed. More than half a million were killed in religious riots as 10–12 million non-Muslims (Hindus, Sikhs mostly) migrated from Pakistan into India, and Muslims migrated from India into Pakistan, across the newly created borders of India, West Pakistan and East Pakistan. Gandhi spent the day of independence not celebrating the end of the British rule, but appealing for peace among his countrymen by fasting and spinning in Calcutta on 15 August 1947. The partition had gripped the Indian subcontinent with religious violence and the streets were filled with corpses. Some writers credit Gandhi's fasting and protests stopped the religious riots and communal violence. Others do not. Archibald Wavell, for example, upon learning of Gandhi's assassination, commented, \"I always thought he [Gandhi] had more of malevolence than benevolence in him, but who am I to judge, and how can an Englishman estimate a Hindu? \"\nAt 5:17 pm on 30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his grandnieces in the garden of the former Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse fired three bullets from a Beretta M1934 9mm Corto pistol into his chest at point-blank range. According to some accounts, Gandhi died on the spot. In other accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom. There he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru addressed his countrymen over the All-India Radio saying: Friends and comrades, the light has gone out of our lives, and there is darkness everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country. Gandhi's assassin Godse made no attempt to escape and was seized by the witnesses. He was arrested. In the weeks that followed, his collaborators were arrested as well. Godse was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha. They were tried in court at Delhi's Red Fort. At his trial, Godse did not deny the charges nor express any remorse. According to Claude Markovits, a French historian noted for his studies of colonial India, Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacence towards Muslims, holding Gandhi responsible for the frenzy of violence and sufferings during the subcontinent's partition into Pakistan and India. Godse accused Gandhi of subjectivism and of acting as if only he had a monopoly of the truth. Godse was found guilty and executed in 1949. Gandhi's death was mourned nationwide. Over two million people joined the five-mile long funeral procession that took over five hours to reach Raj Ghat from Birla house, where he was assassinated. Gandhi's body was transported on a weapons carrier, whose chassis was dismantled overnight to allow a high-floor to be installed so that people could catch a glimpse of his body. The engine of the vehicle was not used; instead four drag-ropes manned by 50 people each pulled the vehicle. All Indian-owned establishments in London remained closed in mourning as thousands of people from all faiths and denominations and Indians from all over Britain converged at India House in London. Gandhi's assassination dramatically changed the political landscape. Nehru became his political heir. According to Markovits, while Gandhi was alive, Pakistan's declaration that it was a \"Muslim state\" had led Indian groups to demand that it be declared a \"Hindu state\". Nehru used Gandhi's martyrdom as a political weapon to silence all advocates of Hindu nationalism as well as his political challengers. He linked Gandhi's assassination to politics of hatred and ill-will. According to Guha, Nehru and his Congress colleagues called on Indians to honour Gandhi's memory and even more his ideals. Nehru used the assassination to consolidate the authority of the new Indian state. Gandhi's death helped marshal support for the new government and legitimise the Congress Party's control, leveraged by the massive outpouring of Hindu expressions of grief for a man who had inspired them for decades. The government suppressed the RSS, the Muslim National Guards, and the Khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests. For years after the assassination, states Markovits, \"Gandhi's shadow loomed large over the political life of the new Indian Republic\". The government quelled any opposition to its economic and social policies, despite they being contrary to Gandhi's ideas, by reconstructing Gandhi's image and ideals.\nGandhi was cremated per the Hindu tradition. Gandhi's ashes were poured into urns which were sent across India for memorial services. Most of the ashes were immersed at the Sangam at Allahabad on 12 February 1948, but some were secretly taken away. In 1997, Tushar Gandhi immersed the contents of one urn, found in a bank vault and reclaimed through the courts, at the Sangam at Allahabad. Some of Gandhi's ashes were scattered at the source of the Nile River near Jinja, Uganda, and a memorial plaque marks the event. On 30 January 2008, the contents of another urn were immersed at Girgaum Chowpatty. Another urn is at the palace of the Aga Khan in Pune (where Gandhi was held as a political prisoner from 1942 to 1944) and another in the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Los Angeles. The Birla House site where Gandhi was assassinated is now a memorial called Gandhi Smriti. The place near Yamuna river where he was cremated is the Rāj Ghāt memorial in New Delhi. A black marble platform, it bears the epigraph \"Hē Rāma\" (Devanagari: हे ! राम or, Hey Raam). These are widely believed to be Gandhi's last words after he was shot, though the veracity of this statement has been disputed.\nGandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him. Some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances. , Quote: \"Yet he [Gandhi] must bear some of the responsibility for losing his followers along the way. The sheer vagueness and contradictions recurrent throughout his writing made it easier to accept him as a saint than to fathom the challenge posed by his demanding beliefs. Gandhi saw no harm in self-contradictions: life was a series of experiments, and any principle might change if Truth so dictated\".\nGandhi grew up in a Hindu and Jain religious atmosphere in his native Gujarat which were his primary influences, but he was also influenced by his personal reflections and literature of Hindu Bhakti saints, Advaita Vedanta, Buddhism, Christianity and thinkers such as Tolstoy, Ruskin and Thoreau. He, at age 57, declared himself to be Advaitist Hindu in his religious persuasion, but added that he supported Dvaitist viewpoints and religious pluralism. Gandhi was influenced by his devout Vaishnava Hindu mother, the regional Hindu temples and saint tradition which co-existed with Jain tradition in Gujarat. Historian R.B. Cribb states that Gandhi's thought evolved over time, with his early ideas becoming the core or scaffolding for his mature philosophy. He committed himself early to truthfulness, temperance, chastity, and vegetarianism. Gandhi's London lifestyle incorporated the values he had grown up with. When he returned to India in 1891, his outlook was parochial and he could not make a living as a lawyer. This challenged his belief that practicality and morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found a solution to this problem and developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy. According to Bhikhu Parekh, three books that influenced Gandhi most in South Africa were William Salter's Ethical Religion ; Henry David Thoreau's On the Duty of Civil Disobedience (1849); and Leo Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God Is Within You (1894). Ruskin inspired his decision to live an austere life on a commune, at first on the Phoenix Farm in Natal and then on the Tolstoy Farm just outside Johannesburg, South Africa. The most profound influence on Gandhi were those from Hinduism, Christianity and Jainism, states Parekh, with his thoughts \"in harmony with the classical Indian traditions, specially the Advaita or monistic tradition\". According to Indira Carr and others, Gandhi was influenced by Vaishnavism, Jainism and Advaita Vedanta. Balkrishna Gokhale states that Gandhi was influenced by Hinduism and Jainism, and his studies of Sermon on the Mount of Christianity, Ruskin and Tolstoy. Additional theories of possible influences on Gandhi have been proposed. For example, in 1935, N. A. Toothi stated that Gandhi was influenced by the reforms and teachings of the Swaminarayan tradition of Hinduism. According to Raymond Williams, Toothi may have overlooked the influence of the Jain community, and adds close parallels do exist in programs of social reform in the Swaminarayan tradition and those of Gandhi, based on \"nonviolence, truth-telling, cleanliness, temperance and upliftment of the masses. \" Historian Howard states the culture of Gujarat influenced Gandhi and his methods.\nAlong with the book mentioned above, in 1908 Leo Tolstoy wrote A Letter to a Hindu, which said that only by using love as a weapon through passive resistance could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish A Letter to a Hindu in Gujarati. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy's death in 1910 (Tolstoy's last letter was to Gandhi). The letters concern practical and theological applications of nonviolence. Gandhi saw himself a disciple of Tolstoy, for they agreed regarding opposition to state authority and colonialism; both hated violence and preached non-resistance. However, they differed sharply on political strategy. Gandhi called for political involvement; he was a nationalist and was prepared to use nonviolent force. He was also willing to compromise. It was at Tolstoy Farm where Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach systematically trained their disciples in the philosophy of nonviolence.\nGandhi credited Shrimad Rajchandra, a poet and Jain philosopher, as his influential counsellor. In Modern Review, June 1930, Gandhi wrote about their first encounter in 1891 at Dr. P.J. Mehta's residence in Bombay. Gandhi exchanged letters with Rajchandra when he was in South Africa, referring to him as Kavi (literally, \"poet\"). In 1930, Gandhi wrote, \"Such was the man who captivated my heart in religious matters as no other man ever has till now. \" 'I have said elsewhere that in moulding my inner life Tolstoy and Ruskin vied with Kavi. But Kavi's influence was undoubtedly deeper if only because I had come in closest personal touch with him.' Gandhi, in his autobiography, called Rajchandra his \"guide and helper\" and his \"refuge… in moments of spiritual crisis\". He had advised Gandhi to be patient and to study Hinduism deeply.\nDuring his stay in South Africa, along with scriptures and philosophical texts of Hinduism and other Indian religions, Gandhi read translated texts of Christianity such as the Bible, and Islam such as the Quran. A Quaker mission in South Africa attempted to convert him to Christianity. Gandhi joined them in their prayers and debated Christian theology with them, but refused conversion stating he did not accept the theology therein or that Christ was the only son of God. His comparative studies of religions and interaction with scholars, led him to respect all religions as well as become concerned about imperfections in all of them and frequent misinterpretations. Gandhi grew fond of Hinduism, and referred to the Bhagavad Gita as his spiritual dictionary and greatest single influence on his life.\nGandhi participated in South African war against the Boers, on the British side in 1899. Both the Dutch settlers called Boers and the imperial British at that time discriminated against the coloured races they considered as inferior, and Gandhi later wrote about his conflicted beliefs during the Boer war. He stated that \"when the war was declared, my personal sympathies were all with the Boers, but my loyalty to the British rule drove me to participation with the British in that war\". According to Gandhi, he felt that since he was demanding his rights as a British citizen, it was also his duty to serve the British forces in the defence of the British Empire. During World War I (1914–1918), nearing the age of 50, Gandhi supported the British and its allied forces by recruiting Indians to join the British army, expanding the Indian contingent from about 100,000 to over 1.1 million. He encouraged his people to fight on one side of the war in Europe and Africa at the cost of their lives. Pacifists criticised and questioned Gandhi, who defended these practices by stating, according to Sankar Ghose, \"it would be madness for me to sever my connection with the society to which I belong\". According to Keith Robbins, the recruitment effort was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I. After the war, the British government offered minor reforms instead, which disappointed Gandhi. He launched his satyagraha movement in 1919. In parallel, Gandhi's fellowmen became sceptical of his pacifist ideas and were inspired by the ideas of nationalism and anti-imperialism. In a 1920 essay, after the World War I, Gandhi wrote, \"where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence. \" Rahul Sagar interprets Gandhi's efforts to recruit for the British military during the War, as Gandhi's belief that, at that time, it would demonstrate that Indians were willing to fight. Further, it would also show the British that his fellow Indians were \"their subjects by choice rather than out of cowardice. \" In 1922, Gandhi wrote that abstinence from violence is effective and true forgiveness only when one has the power to punish, not when one decides not to do anything because one is helpless. After World War II engulfed Britain, Gandhi actively campaigned to oppose any help to the British war effort and any Indian participation in the war. According to Arthur Herman, Gandhi believed that his campaign would strike a blow to imperialism. Gandhi's position was not supported by many Indian leaders, and his campaign against the British war effort was a failure. The Hindu leader, Tej Bahadur Sapru declared in 1941, states Herman, \"A good many Congress leaders are fed up with the barren program of the Mahatma\". Over 2.5 million Indians ignored Gandhi, volunteered and joined on the British side. They fought and died as a part of the allied forces in Europe, North Africa and various fronts of the World War II.\nGandhi dedicated his life to discovering and pursuing truth, or Satya, and called his movement as satyagraha, which means \"appeal to, insistence on, or reliance on the Truth\". The first formulation of the satyagraha as a political movement and principle occurred in 1920, which he tabled as \"Resolution on Non-cooperation\" in September that year before a session of the Indian Congress. It was the satyagraha formulation and step, states Dennis Dalton, that deeply resonated with beliefs and culture of his people, embedded him into the popular consciousness, transforming him quickly into Mahatma. Gandhi based Satyagraha on the Vedantic ideal of self-realization, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and universal love. William Borman states that the key to his satyagraha is rooted in the Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of these ideas are found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas. Gandhi's concept of satya as a civil movement, states Glyn Richards, are best understood in the context of the Hindu terminology of Dharma and Ṛta. Gandhi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own demons, fears, and insecurities. Gandhi summarised his beliefs first when he said \"God is Truth\". He would later change this statement to \"Truth is God\". Thus, satya (truth) in Gandhi's philosophy is \"God\". Gandhi, states Richards, described the term \"God\" not as a separate power, but as the Being (Brahman, Atman) of the Advaita Vedanta tradition, a nondual universal that pervades in all things, in each person and all life. According to Nicholas Gier, this to Gandhi meant the unity of God and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, that atman exists and is same as everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is the very nature of this atman. The essence of Satyagraha is \"soul force\" as a political means, refusing to use brute force against the oppressor, seeking to eliminate antagonisms between the oppressor and the oppressed, aiming to transform or \"purify\" the oppressor. It is not inaction but determined passive resistance and non-co-operation where, states Arthur Herman, \"love conquers hate\". A euphemism sometimes used for Satyagraha is that it is a \"silent force\" or a \"soul force\" (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech). It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. Satyagraha is also termed a \"universal force\", as it essentially \"makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe. \" Gandhi wrote: \"There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause. \" Civil disobedience and non-co-operation as practised under Satyagraha are based on the \"law of suffering\",<ref name=\"CollectedWorks20\"> a doctrine that the endurance of suffering is a means to an end. This end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, non-co-operation in Satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the co-operation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice. While Gandhi's idea of satyagraha as a political means attracted a widespread following among Indians, the support was not universal. For example, Muslim leaders such as Jinnah opposed the satyagraha idea, accused Gandhi to be reviving Hinduism through political activism, and began effort to counter Gandhi with Muslim nationalism and a demand for Muslim homeland. The untouchability leader Ambedkar, in June 1945, after his decision to convert to Buddhism and a key architect of the Constitution of modern India, dismissed Gandhi's ideas as loved by \"blind Hindu devotees\", primitive, influenced by spurious brew of Tolstoy and Ruskin, and \"there is always some simpleton to preach them\". ; B.R. Ambedkar, What Congress and Gandhi have done to the Untouchables, Thacker & Co. Editions, First Edition, pages v, 282–297 Winston Churchill caricatured Gandhi as a \"cunning huckster\" seeking selfish gain, an \"aspiring dictator\", and an \"atavistic spokesman of a pagan Hinduism\". Churchill stated that the civil disobedience movement spectacle of Gandhi only increased \"the danger to which white people there [British India] are exposed\".\nAlthough Gandhi was not the originator of the principle of nonviolence, he was the first to apply it in the political field on a large scale. The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has a long history in Indian religious thought, with it being considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought. Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth.<ref name=\"Borman1986\"> Cited from Gandhi was criticised for refusing to protest the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Udham Singh and Rajguru. He was accused of accepting a deal with the King's representative Irwin that released civil disobedience leaders from prison and accepted the death sentence against the highly popular revolutionary Bhagat Singh, who at his trial had replied, \"Revolution is the inalienable right of mankind\". Gandhi's views came under heavy criticism in Britain when it was under attack from Nazi Germany, and later when the Holocaust was revealed. He told the British people in 1940, \"I would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions... If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them. \" George Orwell remarked that Gandhi's methods confronted 'an old-fashioned and rather shaky despotism which treated him in a fairly chivalrous way', not a totalitarian Power, 'where political opponents simply disappear.' In a post-war interview in 1946, he said, \"Hitler killed five million Jews. It is the greatest crime of our time. But the Jews should have offered themselves to the butcher's knife. They should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs... It would have aroused the world and the people of Germany... As it is they succumbed anyway in their millions. \" Gandhi believed this act of \"collective suicide\", in response to the Holocaust, \"would have been heroism\".\nAccording to Kumaraswamy, Gandhi initially supported Arab demands with respect to Palestine. He justified this support by invoking Islam, stating that \"non-Muslims cannot acquire sovereign jurisdiction\" in Jazirat al-Arab (Arabian Peninsula). These arguments, states Kumaraswamy, were a part of his political strategy to win Muslim support during the Khilafat movement. In post-Khilafat period, Gandhi neither negated Jewish demands nor did he use Islamic texts or history to support Muslim claims against Israel. Gandhi's silence after the Khilafat period may represent an evolution in his understanding of the conflicting religious claims over Palestine, according to Kumaraswamy. In 1938, Gandhi spoke in favour of Jewish claims. In March 1946, he said to the Member of British Parliament Sidney Silverman, \"if the Arabs have a claim to Palestine, the Jews have a prior claim\", a position very different from his earlier stance. Gandhi discussed the persecution of the Jews in Germany and the emigration of Jews from Europe to Palestine through his lens of Satyagraha. In 1937, Gandhi discussed Zionism with his close Jewish friend Hermann Kallenbach. He said that Zionism was not the right answer to the problems faced by Jews and instead recommended Satyagraha. Gandhi thought the Zionists in Palestine represented European imperialism and used violence to achieve their goals; he argued that \"the Jews should disclaim any intention of realizing their aspiration under the protection of arms and should rely wholly on the goodwill of Arabs. No exception can possibly be taken to the natural desire of the Jews to find a home in Palestine. But they must wait for its fulfillment till Arab opinion is ripe for it. \" In 1938, Gandhi stated that his \"sympathies are all with the Jews. I have known them intimately in South Africa. Some of them became life-long companions. \" Philosopher Martin Buber was highly critical of Gandhi's approach and in 1939 wrote an open letter to him on the subject. Gandhi reiterated his stance that \"the Jews seek to convert the Arab heart\", and use \"satyagraha in confronting the Arabs\" in 1947. According to Simone Panter-Brick, Gandhi's political position on Jewish-Arab conflict evolved over the 1917-1947 period, shifting from a support for the Arab position first, and for the Jewish position in the 1940s.\nGandhi criticised as well as praised Christianity. He was critical of Christian missionary efforts in British India, because they mixed medical or education assistance with demands that the beneficiary convert to Christianity. According to Gandhi, this was not true \"service\" but one driven by ulterior motive of luring people into religious conversion and exploiting the economically or medically desperate. It did not lead to inner transformation or moral advance or to the Christian teaching of \"love\", but was based on false one-sided criticisms of other religions, when Christian societies faced similar problems in South Africa and Europe. It led to the converted person hating his neighbours and others religions, it divided people rather than bringing them closer in compassion. According to Gandhi, \"no religious tradition could claim a monopoly over truth or salvation\". Gandhi did not support laws to prohibit missionary activity, but demanded that Christians should first understand the message of Jesus, and then strive to live without stereotyping and misrepresenting other religions. According to Gandhi, the message of Jesus wasn't to humiliate and imperialistically rule over other people considering them inferior or second class or slaves, but that \"when the hungry are fed and peace comes to our individual and collective life, then Christ is born\". Gandhi believed that his long acquaintance with Christianity had made him like it as well as find it imperfect. He asked Christians to stop humiliating his country and his people as heathens, idolators and other abusive language, and to change their negative views of India. He believed that Christians should introspect on the \"true meaning of religion\" and get a desire to study and learn from Indian religions in the spirit of universal brotherhood. According to Eric Sharpe – a professor of Religious Studies, though Gandhi was born in a Hindu family and later became Hindu by conviction, many Christians in time thought of him as an \"exemplary Christian and even as a saint\".\nGandhi believed there were material contradictions between Hinduism and Islam, and he shared his thoughts on the Quran and Muslims many times. He stated in 1925, for example, that he had not criticised the teachings of the Quran, but he did criticise the interpreters of Quran. Gandhi believed that numerous interpreters have interpreted it to fit their preconceived notions. He believed Muslims should welcome criticism of Quran, because \"every true scripture only gains from criticism\". Gandhi criticised Muslims who \"betray intolerance of criticism by a non-Muslim of anything related to Islam\", such as the penalty of stoning to death under Islamic law. To Gandhi, Islam has \"nothing to fear from criticism even if it be unreasonable\". According to him, Islam like communism was too quick in resorting to violence. One of the strategies Gandhi adopted was to work with Muslim leaders of pre-partition India, to oppose the British imperialism in and outside the Indian subcontinent. After the World War I, in 1919–22, he won Muslim leadership support of Ali Brothers by backing the Khilafat Movement in favour the Islamic Caliph and his historic Ottoman Caliphate, and opposing the secular Islam supporting Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. By 1924, Ataturk had ended the Caliphate, the Khilafat Movement was over, and Muslim support for Gandhi had largely evaporated. In 1925, Gandhi gave another reason to why he got involved in the Khilafat movement and the Middle East affairs between Britain and the Ottoman Empire. Gandhi explained to his co-religionists (Hindu) that he sympathised and campaigned for the Islamic cause, not because he cared for the Sultan, but because \"I wanted to enlist the Mussalman's sympathy in the matter of cow protection\". According to the historian M. Naeem Qureshi, like the then Indian Muslim leaders who had combined religion and politics, Gandhi too imported his religion into his political strategy during the Khilafat movement. In the 1940s, Gandhi pooled ideas with some Muslim leaders who sought religious harmony like him, and opposed the proposed partition of British India into India and Pakistan. For example, his close friend Badshah Khan suggested that they should work towards opening Hindu temples for Muslim prayers, and Islamic mosques for Hindu prayers, to bring the two religious groups closer. Gandhi accepted this and began having Muslim prayers read in Hindu temples to play his part, but was unable to get Hindu prayers read in mosques. The Hindu nationalist groups objected and began confronting Gandhi for this one-sided practice, by shouting and demonstrating inside the Hindu temples, in the last years of his life.\nGandhi believed that Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism were traditions of Hinduism, with shared history, rites and ideas. At other times, he acknowledged that he knew little about Buddhism other than his reading of Edwin Arnold's book on it. Based on that book, he considered Buddhism to be a reform movement and the Buddha to be a Hindu. He stated he knew Jainism much more, and he credited Jains to have profoundly influenced him. Sikhism, to Gandhi, was an integral part of Hinduism, in the form of another reform movement. Sikh and Buddhist leaders disagreed with Gandhi, a disagreement Gandhi respected as a difference of opinion.\nGandhi was brought up as a vegetarian by his devout Hindu mother. The idea of vegetarianism is deeply ingrained in Hindu Vaishnavism and Jain traditions in India, such as in his native Gujarat, where meat is considered as a form of food obtained by violence to animals. Gandhi's rationale for vegetarianism was largely along those found in Hindu and Jain texts. Gandhi believed that any form of food inescapably harms some form of living organism, but one should seek to understand and reduce the violence in what one consumes because \"there is essential unity of all life\". Gandhi believed that some life forms are more capable of suffering, and non-violence to him meant not having the intent as well as active efforts to minimise hurt, injury or suffering to all life forms. Gandhi explored food sources that reduced violence to various life forms in the food chain. He believed that slaughtering animals is unnecessary, as other sources of foods are available. He also consulted with vegetarianism campaigners during his lifetime, such as with Henry Stephens Salt. Food to Gandhi was not only a source of sustaining one's body, but a source of his impact on other living beings, and one that affected his mind, character and spiritual well being. He avoided not only meat, but also eggs and milk. Gandhi wrote the book The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism and wrote for the London Vegetarian Society's publication. Beyond his religious beliefs, Gandhi stated another motivation for his experiments with diet. He attempted to find the most non-violent vegetarian meal that the poorest human could afford, taking meticulous notes on vegetables and fruits, and his observations with his own body and his ashram in Gujarat. He tried fresh and dry fruits (Fruitarianism), then just sun dried fruits, before resuming his prior vegetarian diet on advice of his doctor and concerns of his friends. His experiments with food began in 1890s and continued for several decades. For some of these experiments, Gandhi combined his own ideas with those found on diet in Indian yoga texts. He believed that each vegetarian should experiment with his or her diet because, in his studies at his ashram he saw \"one man's food may be poison for another\". Gandhi championed animal rights in general. Other than making vegetarian choices, he actively campaigned against dissection studies and experimentation on live animals (vivisection) in the name of science and medical studies. He considered it a violence against animals, something that inflicted pain and suffering. He wrote, \"Vivisection in my opinion is the blackest of all the blackest crimes that man is at present committing against god and his fair creation. \"\nGandhi used fasting as a political device, often threatening suicide unless demands were met. Congress publicised the fasts as a political action that generated widespread sympathy. In response the government tried to manipulate news coverage to minimise his challenge to the Raj. He fasted in 1932 to protest the voting scheme for separate political representation for Dalits; Gandhi did not want them segregated. The British government stopped the London press from showing photographs of his emaciated body, because it would elicit sympathy. Gandhi's 1943 hunger strike took place during a two-year prison term for the anticolonial Quit India movement. The government called on nutritional experts to demystify his action, and again no photos were allowed. However, his final fast in 1948, after the end of British rule in India, his hunger strike was lauded by the British press and this time did include full-length photos. Alter states that Gandhi's fasting, vegetarianism and diet was more than a political leverage, it was a part of his experiments with self restraint and healthy living. He was \"profoundly skeptical of traditional Ayurveda\", encouraging it to study the scientific method and adopt its progressive learning approach. Gandhi believed yoga offered health benefits. He believed that a healthy nutritional diet based on regional foods and hygiene were essential to good health.\nGandhi strongly favoured the emancipation of women, and urged \"the women to fight for their own self-development. \" He opposed purdah, child marriage, dowry and sati. A wife is not a slave of the husband, stated Gandhi, but his comrade, better half, colleague and friend, according to Lyn Norvell. In his own life however, according to Suruchi Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi's relationship with his wife were at odds with some of these values. At various occasions, Gandhi credited his orthodox Hindu mother, and his wife, for first lessons in satyagraha. He used the legends of Hindu goddess Sita to expound women's innate strength, autonomy and \"lioness in spirit\" whose moral compass can make any demon \"as helpless as a goat\". To Gandhi, the women of India were an important part of the \"swadeshi movement\" (Buy Indian), and his goal of decolonising the Indian economy. Some historians such as Angela Woollacott and Kumari Jayawardena state that even though Gandhi often and publicly expressed his belief in the equality of sexes, yet his vision was one of gender difference and complementarity between them. Women, to Gandhi, should be educated to be better in the domestic realm and educate the next generation. His views on women's right were less liberal and more similar to puritan-Victorian expectations of women, states Jayawardena, than other Hindu leaders with him who supported economic independence and equal gender rights in all aspects.\nAlong with many other texts, Gandhi studied Bhagavad Gita while in South Africa. This Hindu scripture discusses jnana yoga, bhakti yoga and karma yoga along with virtues such as non-violence, patience, integrity, lack of hypocrisy, self restraint and abstinence. Gandhi began experiments with these, and in 1906 at age 37, although married and a father, he vowed to abstain from sexual relations. Gandhi's experiment with abstinence went beyond sex, and extended to food. He consulted the Jain scholar Rajchandra, whom he fondly called Raychandbhai. Rajchandra advised him that milk stimulated sexual passion. Gandhi began abstaining from cow's milk in 1912, and did so even when doctors advised him to consume milk. According to Sankar Ghose, Tagore described Gandhi as someone who did not abhor sex or women, but considered sexual life as inconsistent with his moral goals. Gandhi tried to test and prove to himself his brahmacharya. The experiments began some time after the death of his wife in February 1944. At the start of his experiment he had women sleep in the same room but in different beds. He later slept with women in the same bed but clothed, and finally he slept naked with women. In April 1945, Gandhi referenced being naked with several \"women or girls\" in a letter to Birla as part of the experiments. According to the 1960s memoir of his grandniece Manu, Gandhi feared in early 1947 that he and she may be killed by Muslims in the run up to India's independence in August 1947, and asked her when she was 18-year-old if she wanted to help him with his experiments to test their \"purity\", for which she readily accepted. Gandhi slept naked in the same bed with Manu with the bedroom doors open all night. Manu stated that the experiment had no \"ill effect\" on her. Gandhi also shared his bed with 18-year-old Abha, wife of his grandnephew Kanu. Gandhi would sleep with both Manu and Abha at the same time. None of the women who participated in the brahmachari experiments of Gandhi indicated that they had sex or that Gandhi behaved in any sexual way. Those who went public said they felt as though they were sleeping with their ageing mother. According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in his final year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly skeletal figure, already caricatured in the Western media. In February 1947, he asked his confidants such as Birla and Ramakrishna if it was wrong for him to experiment his brahmacharya oath. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi said that if he would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Some of his staff resigned, including two of his newspaper's editors who had refused to print some of Gandhi's sermons dealing with his experiments. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.\nGandhi spoke out against untouchability early in his life. Before 1932, he and his colleagues used the term Antyaja for untouchables. One of the major speeches he made on untouchability was at Nagpur in 1920, where he called untouchability as a great evil in Hindu society. In his remarks, he stated that the phenomena of untouchability is not unique to the Hindu society, but has deeper roots because Europeans in South Africa treat \"all of us, Hindus and Muslims, as untouchables; we may not reside in their midst, nor enjoy the rights which they do\". He called it intolerable. He stated this practice can be eradicated, Hinduism is flexible to allow this, and a concerted effort is needed to persuade it is wrong and by all to eradicate it. According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi considered untouchability to be wrong and evil, he believed that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority. Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but no one should expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual regardless of his or her background, stated Gandhi, has a right to choose who they welcome into their home, who they befriend and who they spend time with. In 1932, Gandhi began a new campaign to improve the lives of the untouchables, whom he started referring to as Harijans or \"the children of god\". On 8 May 1933, Gandhi began a 21-day fast of self-purification and launched a one-year campaign to help the Harijan movement. This new campaign was not universally embraced within the Dalit community. Ambedkar and his allies felt Gandhi was being paternalistic and was undermining Dalit political rights. Ambedkar described him as \"devious and untrustworthy\". He accused Gandhi as someone who wished to retain the caste system. Ambedkar and Gandhi debated their ideas and concerns, where both tried to persuade each other. In 1935, Ambedkar announced his intentions to leave Hinduism and join Buddhism. According to Sankar Ghose, the announcement shook Gandhi, who reappraised his views and wrote many essays with his views on castes, inter-marriage and what Hinduism says on the subject. These views contrasted with those of Ambedkar. In actual elections of 1937, except for some seats in Mumbai where Ambekar's party won, India's untouchables voted heavily in favour of Gandhi's campaign and his party, the Congress. Gandhi and his colleagues continued to consult Ambedkar, keeping him influential. Ambedkar worked with other Congress leaders through the 1940s, wrote large parts of India's constitution in late 1940s, and converted to Buddhism in 1956. According to Jaffrelot, Gandhi's views evolved between 1920s and 1940s, when in 1946 he actively encouraged inter-marriage across castes. However, Gandhi's approach to untouchability was different than Ambedkar because Gandhi championed fusion, choice and free intermixing. Ambedkar, in contrast states Jeffrelot, envisioned each segment of society to maintain their identity group, and each group then separately advanced the \"politics of equality\". The criticism of Gandhi by Ambedkar continued to influence the Dalit movement past Gandhi's death. According to Arthur Herman, Ambedkar's hate for Gandhi and Gandhi's ideas was so strong that after he heard the news of Gandhi's assassination, remarked after a momentary silence a sense of regret and then \"my real enemy is gone; thank goodness the eclipse is over now\". ; Laxman Kawale, ''Dalit's Social Transformation: Redefining the Social Justice'', ISRJ, Volume 1, Issue XII, page 3; Quote: \"Even though Ambedkar was a party to Poona Pact, he was never reconciled to it. His contempt against Gandhi which was [sic] continued even after his assassination on January 30, 1948. On the death of Gandhi he expressed, \"My real enemy has gone; thank goodness the eclipse is over\". He equated the assassination of Gandhi with that of Caesar and the remark of Cicero to the messenger – \"Tell the Romans, your hour of liberty has come\". He further remarked, \"While one regrets the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, one cannot help finding in his heart the echo of the sentiments expressed by Cicero on the assassination of Caesar\". According to Ramachandra Guha, \"ideologues have carried these old rivalries into the present, with the demonization of Gandhi now common among politicians who presume to speak in Ambedkar's name.\nGandhi rejected the colonial Western format of education system. He stated that it led to disdain for manual work, generally created an elite administrative bureaucracy. Gandhi favoured an education system with far greater emphasis on learning skills in practical and useful work, one that included physical, mental and spiritual studies. His methodology sought to treat all professions equal and pay everyone the same. Gandhi called his ideas Nai Talim (literally, 'new education'). He believed that the Western style education violated and destroyed the indigenous cultures. A different basic education model, he believed, would lead to better self awareness, prepare people to treat all work equally respectable and valued, and lead to a society with less social diseases. Nai Talim evolved out of his experiences at the Tolstoy Farm in South Africa, and Gandhi attempted to formulate the new system at the Sevagram ashram after 1937. Nehru government's vision of an industrialised, centrally planned economy after 1947 had scant place for Gandhi's village-oriented approach. In his autobiography, Gandhi wrote that he believed every Hindu boy and girl must learn Sanskrit because its historic and spiritual texts are in that language.\nGandhi believed that swaraj not only can be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence. Military is unnecessary, because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While military is unnecessary in a nation organised under swaraj principle, Gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature. However, the state would limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force. According to Gandhi, a non-violent state is like an \"ordered anarchy\". In a society of mostly non-violent individuals, those who are violent will sooner or later accept discipline or leave the community, stated Gandhi. He emphasised a society where individuals believed more in learning about their duties and responsibilities, not demanded rights and privileges. On returning from South Africa, when Gandhi received a letter asking for his participation in writing a world charter for human rights, he responded saying, \"in my experience, it is far more important to have a charter for human duties. \" Swaraj to Gandhi did not mean transferring colonial era British power brokering system, favours-driven, bureaucratic, class exploitative structure and mindset into Indian hands. He warned such a transfer would still be English rule, just without the Englishman. \"This is not the Swaraj I want\", said Gandhi. Tewari states that Gandhi saw democracy as more than a system of government; it meant promoting both individuality and the self-discipline of the community. Democracy meant settling disputes in a nonviolent manner; it required freedom of thought and expression. For Gandhi, democracy was a way of life.\nSome scholars state Gandhi supported a religiously diverse India, while others state that the Muslim leaders who championed the partition and creation of a separate Muslim Pakistan considered Gandhi to be Hindu nationalist or revivalist. For example, in his letters to Mohammad Iqbal, Jinnah accused Gandhi to be favouring a Hindu rule and revivalism, that Gandhi led Indian National Congress was a fascist party. In an interview with C.F. Andrews, Gandhi stated that if we believe all religions teach the same message of love and peace between all human beings, then there is neither any rationale nor need for proselytisation or attempts to convert people from one religion to another. Gandhi opposed missionary organisations who criticised Indian religions then attempted to convert followers of Indian religions to Islam or Christianity. In Gandhi's view, those who attempt to convert a Hindu, \"they must harbour in their breasts the belief that Hinduism is an error\" and that their own religion is \"the only true religion\". Gandhi believed that people who demand religious respect and rights must also show the same respect and grant the same rights to followers of other religions. He stated that spiritual studies must encourage \"a Hindu to become a better Hindu, a Mussalman to become a better Mussalman, and a Christian a better Christian. \" According to Gandhi, religion is not about what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god. It is not important to convert or to join any religion, but it is important to improve one's way of life and conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed Gandhi.\nGandhi believed in sarvodaya economic model, which literally means \"welfare, upliftment of all\". This, states Bhatt, was very different economic model than the socialism model championed and followed by free India by Nehru – India's first prime minister. To both, according to Bhatt, removing poverty and unemployment were the objective, but Gandhian economic and development approach preferred adapting technology and infrastructure to suit local situation, in contrast to Nehru's large scale, socialised state owned enterprises. To Gandhi, the economic philosophy that aims at \"greatest good for the greatest number\" was fundamentally flawed, and his alternative proposal sarvodaya set its aim at \"greatest good for all\". He believed that the best economic system not only cared to lift the \"poor, less skilled, of impoverished background\" but also empowered to lift the \"rich, highly skilled, of capital means and landlords\". Violence against any human being, born poor or rich, is wrong believed Gandhi. He stated that mandate theory of majoritarian democracy shouldn't be pushed to absurd extremes, individual freedoms should never be denied, and no person should ever be made a social or economic slave to the \"resolutions of majorities\". Gandhi challenged Nehru and the modernizers in the late 1930s who called for rapid industrialisation on the Soviet model; Gandhi denounced that as dehumanising and contrary to the needs of the villages where the great majority of the people lived. After Gandhi's assassination, Nehru led India in accordance with his personal socialist convictions. Historian Kuruvilla Pandikattu says \"it was Nehru's vision, not Gandhi's, that was eventually preferred by the Indian State. \" Gandhi called for ending poverty through improved agriculture and small-scale cottage rural industries. Gandhi's economic thinking disagreed with Marx, according to the political theory scholar and economist Bhikhu Parekh. Gandhi refused to endorse the view that economic forces are best understood as \"antagonistic class interests\". He argued that no man can degrade or brutalise the other without degrading and brutalising himself, that sustainable economic growth comes from service, not from exploitation. Further, believed Gandhi, that in a free nation, victims exist only when they co-operate with their oppressor, and an economic and political system that offered increasing alternatives gave power of choice to the poorest man. While disagreeing with Nehru about socialist economic model, Gandhi also critiqued capitalism that was driven by endless wants and a materialistic view of man. This, he believed, created a vicious vested system of materialism at the cost of other human needs such as spirituality and social relationships. To Gandhi, states Parekh, both communism and capitalism were wrong, in part because both focussed exclusively on materialistic view of man, and because the former deified the state with unlimited power of violence, while the latter deified capital. A better economic system is one which does not impoverish one's culture and spiritual pursuits.\nGandhism designates the ideas and principles Gandhi promoted. Of central importance is nonviolent resistance. A can mean either an individual who follows, or a specific philosophy which is attributed to, Gandhism. M. M. Sankhdher argues that Gandhism is not a systematic position in metaphysics or in political philosophy. Rather, it is a political creed, an economic doctrine, a religious outlook, a moral precept, and especially, a humanitarian world view. It is an effort not to systematise wisdom but to transform society and is based on an undying faith in the goodness of human nature. However Gandhi himself did not approve of the notion of \"Gandhism\", as he explained in 1936:\nGandhi was a prolific writer. One of Gandhi's earliest publications, Hind Swaraj, published in Gujarati in 1909, became \"the intellectual blueprint\" for India's independence movement. The book was translated into English the next year, with a copyright legend that read \"No Rights Reserved\". For decades he edited several newspapers including Harijan in Gujarati, in Hindi and in the English language; Indian Opinion while in South Africa and, Young India, in English, and Navajivan, a Gujarati monthly, on his return to India. Later, Navajivan was also published in Hindi. In addition, he wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers. Gandhi also wrote several books including his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth (Gujarātī \"સત્યના પ્રયોગો અથવા આત્મકથા\"), of which he bought the entire first edition to make sure it was reprinted. His other autobiographies included: Satyagraha in South Africa about his struggle there, Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule, a political pamphlet, and a paraphrase in Gujarati of John Ruskin's Unto This Last. This last essay can be considered his programme on economics. He also wrote extensively on vegetarianism, diet and health, religion, social reforms, etc. Gandhi usually wrote in Gujarati, though he also revised the Hindi and English translations of his books. Gandhi's complete works were published by the Indian government under the name The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi in the 1960s. The writings comprise about 50,000 pages published in about a hundred volumes. In 2000, a revised edition of the complete works sparked a controversy, as it contained a large number of errors and omissions. The Indian government later withdrew the revised edition.\nGandhi influenced important leaders and political movements. Leaders of the civil rights movement in the United States, including Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, and James Bevel, drew from the writings of Gandhi in the development of their own theories about nonviolence. King said \"Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the tactics. \" King sometimes referred to Gandhi as \"the little brown saint. \" Anti-apartheid activist and former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, was inspired by Gandhi. Others include Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Steve Biko, and Aung San Suu Kyi. In his early years, the former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela was a follower of the nonviolent resistance philosophy of Gandhi. Bhana and Vahed commented on these events as \"Gandhi inspired succeeding generations of South African activists seeking to end White rule. This legacy connects him to Nelson Mandela...in a sense Mandela completed what Gandhi started. \" Gandhi's life and teachings inspired many who specifically referred to Gandhi as their mentor or who dedicated their lives to spreading Gandhi's ideas. In Europe, Romain Rolland was the first to discuss Gandhi in his 1924 book Mahatma Gandhi, and Brazilian anarchist and feminist Maria Lacerda de Moura wrote about Gandhi in her work on pacifism. In 1931, notable European physicist Albert Einstein exchanged written letters with Gandhi, and called him \"a role model for the generations to come\" in a letter writing about him. Einstein said of Gandhi: Mahatma Gandhi's life achievement stands unique in political history. He has invented a completely new and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only be the work of such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come. Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood. Lanza del Vasto went to India in 1936 intending to live with Gandhi; he later returned to Europe to spread Gandhi's philosophy and founded the Community of the Ark in 1948 (modelled after Gandhi's ashrams). Madeleine Slade (known as \"Mirabehn\") was the daughter of a British admiral who spent much of her adult life in India as a devotee of Gandhi. In addition, the British musician John Lennon referred to Gandhi when discussing his views on nonviolence. At the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival in 2007, former US Vice-President and environmentalist Al Gore spoke of Gandhi's influence on him.<ref name=\"Al Gore\"> US President Barack Obama in a 2010 address to the Parliament of India said that: I am mindful that I might not be standing before you today, as President of the United States, had it not been for Gandhi and the message he shared with America and the world. Obama in September 2009 said that his biggest inspiration came from Gandhi. His reply was in response to the question 'Who was the one person, dead or live, that you would choose to dine with?'. He continued that \"He's somebody I find a lot of inspiration in. He inspired Dr. King with his message of nonviolence. He ended up doing so much and changed the world just by the power of his ethics. \" Time Magazine named The 14th Dalai Lama, Lech Wałęsa, Martin Luther King, Cesar Chavez, Aung San Suu Kyi, Benigno Aquino, Jr., Desmond Tutu, and Nelson Mandela as Children of Gandhi and his spiritual heirs to nonviolence. The Mahatma Gandhi District in Houston, Texas, United States, an ethnic Indian enclave, is officially named after Gandhi.\nIn 2007, the United Nations General Assembly declared Gandhi's birthday 2 October as \"the International Day of Nonviolence. \" First proposed by UNESCO in 1948, as the School Day of Nonviolence and Peace (DENIP in Spanish), 30 January is observed as the School Day of Nonviolence and Peace in schools of many countries In countries with a Southern Hemisphere school calendar, it is observed on 30 March.\nTime magazine named Gandhi the Man of the Year in 1930. Gandhi was also the runner-up to Albert Einstein as \"Person of the Century\" at the end of 1999. The Government of India awarded the annual Gandhi Peace Prize to distinguished social workers, world leaders and citizens. Nelson Mandela, the leader of South Africa's struggle to eradicate racial discrimination and segregation, was a prominent non-Indian recipient. In 2011, Time magazine named Gandhi as one of the top 25 political icons of all time. Gandhi did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize, although he was nominated five times between 1937 and 1948, including the first-ever nomination by the American Friends Service Committee, though he made the short list only twice, in 1937 and 1947. Decades later, the Nobel Committee publicly declared its regret for the omission, and admitted to deeply divided nationalistic opinion denying the award. Gandhi was nominated in 1948 but was assassinated before nominations closed. That year, the committee chose not to award the peace prize stating that \"there was no suitable living candidate\" and later research shows that the possibility of awarding the prize posthumously to Gandhi was discussed and that the reference to no suitable living candidate was to Gandhi. Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said, \"The greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question\". When the 14th Dalai Lama was awarded the Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was \"in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi\".\nIndians widely describe Gandhi as the father of the nation. Origin of this title is traced back to a radio address (on Singapore radio) on 6 July 1944 by Subhash Chandra Bose where Bose addressed Gandhi as \"The Father of the Nation\". On 28 April 1947, Sarojini Naidu during a conference also referred Gandhi as \"Father of the Nation\".\nA 5 hours, 9 minutes long biographical documentary film, Mahatma: Life of Gandhi, 1869–1948, made by Vithalbhai Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi's words and using black & white archival footage and photographs, captures the history of those times. Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The 1996 film The Making of the Mahatma documented Gandhi's time in South Africa and his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised political leader. Gandhi was a central figure in the 2006 Bollywood comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Jahnu Barua's Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (I did not kill Gandhi), places contemporary society as a backdrop with its vanishing memory of Gandhi's values as a metaphor for the senile forgetfulness of the protagonist of his 2005 film, writes Vinay Lal. The 1979 opera Satyagraha by American composer Philip Glass is loosely based on Gandhi's life. The opera's libretto, taken from the Bhagavad Gita, is sung in the original Sanskrit. Anti-Gandhi themes have also been showcased through films and plays. The 1995 Marathi play Gandhi Virudh Gandhi explored the relationship between Gandhi and his son Harilal. The 2007 film, Gandhi, My Father was inspired on the same theme. The 1989 Marathi play Me Nathuram Godse Boltoy and the 1997 Hindi play Gandhi Ambedkar criticised Gandhi and his principles. Several biographers have undertaken the task of describing Gandhi's life. Among them are D. G. Tendulkar with his Mahatma. Life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in eight volumes, Chaman Nahal's Gandhi Quartet, and Pyarelal and Sushila Nayyar with their Mahatma Gandhi in 10 volumes. The 2010 biography, Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi and His Struggle With India by Joseph Lelyveld contained controversial material speculating about Gandhi's sexual life.<ref name=\"LelyveldNYT\"> (Review of Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi and His Struggle With India by Joseph Lelyveld). Lelyveld, however, stated that the press coverage \"grossly distort[s]\" the overall message of the book. The 2014 film Welcome Back Gandhi takes a fictionalised look at how Gandhi might react to modern day India. \"Mahatma Gandhi\" is used by Cole Porter in his lyrics for the song You're the Top which is included in the 1934 musical Anything Goes. In the song Porter rhymes \"Mahatma Gandhi' with \"Napoleon Brandy.\nIndia, with its rapid economic modernisation and urbanisation, has rejected Gandhi's economics but accepted much of his politics and continues to revere his memory. Reporter Jim Yardley notes that, \"modern India is hardly a Gandhian nation, if it ever was one. His vision of a village-dominated economy was shunted aside during his lifetime as rural romanticism, and his call for a national ethos of personal austerity and nonviolence has proved antithetical to the goals of an aspiring economic and military power. \" By contrast Gandhi is \"given full credit for India's political identity as a tolerant, secular democracy. \" Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is a national holiday in India, Gandhi Jayanti. Gandhi's image also appears on paper currency of all denominations issued by Reserve Bank of India, except for the one rupee note. Gandhi's date of death, 30 January, is commemorated as a Martyrs' Day in India. There are three temples in India dedicated to Gandhi. One is located at Sambalpur in Orissa and the second at Nidaghatta village near Kadur in Chikmagalur district of Karnataka and the third one at Chityal in the district of Nalgonda, Telangana. The Gandhi Memorial in Kanyakumari resembles central Indian Hindu temples and the Tamukkam or Summer Palace in Madurai now houses the Mahatma Gandhi Museum.\n"]
